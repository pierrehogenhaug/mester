-----

The Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in an electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted
via this medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and, consequently, none of the Initial
Purchasers, any person who controls the Initial Purchasers, Grupo Antolín-Irausa, S.A. (the “Company”) or any of their
respective subsidiaries, directors, officers, employers, employees or agents, or any affiliate of the foregoing persons, accepts
any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in
electronic format and the hard copy version available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

You are reminded that the Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into
whose possession the Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which
you are located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the Offering Memorandum to any other person. You may
not transmit the Offering Memorandum (or any copy of it or part thereof) or disclose, whether orally or in writing, any of its
contents to any other person except with the consent of the Initial Purchasers. If you receive the Offering Memorandum by
e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this communication. Any reply e-mail communications, including those you generate
by using the “Reply” function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive the Offering Memorandum
by e-mail, your use of this e-mail is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that it is free
from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

Under no circumstances shall the Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to
buy, nor shall there be any sale of, the securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
If a jurisdiction requires that the offering and sale of the securities be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial
Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering of the securities
shall be deemed to be made by them or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer (as defined in the Offering Memorandum) in such
jurisdiction.

The Offering Memorandum is being furnished in connection with an offering exempt from registration under the
Securities Act. Nothing in this electronic transmission constitutes an offer of securities for sale in the United States or to any
U.S. person. Recipients of the Offering Memorandum who intend to subscribe for or purchase securities are reminded that any
subscription or purchase may only be made on the basis of the information contained in the Offering Memorandum.

**_MiFID II product governance—Professional investors and ECPs only target market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any Initial Purchaser that considers itself as a manufacturer
pursuant to Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”) (each a “Manufacturer” and, together, the “Manufacturers”),
the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that:
(i) the target market for such securities is only eligible counterparties and professional clients, each as defined in MiFID II and
(ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person
subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own
target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in any
member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an
offer in a member state of the EEA of securities which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum
may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a
prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor any
of the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in which
an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer. The Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum is not directed to any retail investors in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer
within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a “qualified investor”
as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**_UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any Initial Purchaser that considers itself as a manufacturer
pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product
**Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in**
respect of the securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such
securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such securities to eligible counterparties and professional
clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “UK distributor”)
should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a UK distributor subject to the UK
MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities
(by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution
channels.

In the United Kingdom, the Offering Memorandum is for distribution only to persons who: (i) have professional
experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
(Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article
49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order; (iii) are outside
the United Kingdom; or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA (as defined below)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise
lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).
The Offering Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not
relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which the Offering Memorandum relates is available only to relevant
persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

The Offering Memorandum is not directed to any retail investors in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“EUWA”); (ii) a customer
within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules
or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify
as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law
by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Consequently,
no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of
the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the securities described in the Offering
Memorandum or otherwise making such securities available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and
therefore offering, selling or distributing the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making such
securities available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities described therein in the
United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish
a prospectus for offers of such securities. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in the United Kingdom
of securities which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances
in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the
UK Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized,
nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any
of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer. The Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes
of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED JULY 15, 2024**

**STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL** **NOT FOR GENERAL DISTRIBUTION**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **IN THE UNITED STATES**


**Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U.**
**€250.0 million** **% Senior Secured Notes due 2030**


Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U., a sole shareholder limited liability company (sociedad anónima unipersonal) incorporated and existing under the laws of Spain (the “Company”), is
offering €250.0 million % Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The proceeds from the offering of the Notes will be used as set forth under “Use of Proceeds.”

Interest will be paid on the Notes semi-annually in arrears in cash on and of each year, commencing on, 2025. The Notes will mature on,
2030. Prior to, 2026, the Company may redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, at any time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued
and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus the applicable “make whole” premium, as described herein. In addition, prior to, 2026, the Company may redeem
at its option up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering
Memorandum. At any time on or after    , 2026, the Company will be entitled at its option to redeem all or a portion of the Notes, upon not less than ten days’ notice, at the
applicable redemption price set forth in this Offering Memorandum. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption”. The Company may redeem all of the Notes, at any time,
at a price equal to their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any, upon the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law. Upon
the occurrence of certain events of default constituting a “change of control”, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of the principal amount
redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and additional amounts, if any. A change of control, however, will not be deemed to have occurred on one occasion if, pro forma
for such change of control, a specified leverage ratio is not exceeded in connection with such event.

The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security” and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with
all existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated to the Notes, including the 2028 Notes (as defined herein), the Senior Facilities (as defined herein), the
EIB Facilities (as defined herein) and the COFIDES Facility (as defined herein), (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by property or assets
that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of the
Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors (each
as defined herein), all of which also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility (the “Issue Date
**Guarantees”), and (ii) within 120 days from the Issue Date (subject to the satisfaction of applicable local law formalities and the Agreed Security Principles), by the Post-Closing**
Date Guarantors (as defined herein), all of which will also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES
Facility (the “Post-Closing Date Guarantees” and together with the Issue Date Guarantees, the “Guarantees”), provided that such Guarantees (as defined herein) will be subject
to the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.” The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be
a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated to
that Guarantor’s Guarantee, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and
future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and any guarantees thereof, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all of such
Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such
indebtedness and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.
Within 120 days from the date of issuance of the Notes (the “Issue Date”), the Notes will be secured by a pledge numerically successive to the pledges securing the existing senior
secured debt over 100% of the shares of the Company held by HoldCo (as defined herein) (the “Collateral”). Notwithstanding the fact that the Notes will be secured by a pledge
numerically successive to the pledges securing the existing senior secured debt, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined herein), recoveries received upon enforcement
of the Collateral will be applied pro rata in repayment of senior liabilities of the Company, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES
Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”. The Collateral also secures the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES
Facility, ranking pari passu with the security granted for the benefit of the lenders pursuant to the Senior Facilities, the holders of the 2028 Notes, the lenders pursuant to the EIB
Facilities and the lenders pursuant to the COFIDES Facility. The Collateral will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, and may be released under certain circumstances.
The laws of Spain limit the amount of obligations that may be guaranteed, or in respect of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of the Guarantees
and the security securing the Notes and the Guarantees. For more information on limitations to the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees and the security interests in the
Collateral and the liability of the Guarantors and the security providers, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.”
There is currently no public market for the Notes. We will apply to have the Notes admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF
Market (“Euro MTF”). There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Euro MTF Market. This Offering Memorandum includes information on
the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer restrictions. This Offering Memorandum may not be reproduced or used for any other
purposes, nor furnished to any other person other than those to whom copies have been sent by the Company or the Initial Purchasers named below.

**Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 29 for a discussion of certain risks that you should consider in connection with**
**an investment in any of the Notes.**

**Offering price for the Notes:** **%**
plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.


This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation is unlawful. The
Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. federal or state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold within the
U.S. or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (“Regulation S”), as amended (the “Securities Act”)),
except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Initial Purchasers named below are
offering the Notes only to “qualified institutional buyers” (“QIBs”), as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act (“Rule 144A”), in reliance on Rule 144A, and to persons
outside the U.S. in reliance on Regulation S. See “Notice to Investors” and “Transfer Restrictions” for further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions.

The Notes will be in registered form and will initially be issued in denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and will only be transferable in
minimum principal amounts of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Notes will be represented on issue by one or more global notes, which we expect
will be delivered through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) on or about, 2024.

This Offering Memorandum is confidential and has been prepared solely for use in connection with the Offering
described herein. This Offering Memorandum is personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer or solicitation by
anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make
such offer or solicitation. No action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action
would be required for that purpose. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this
Offering Memorandum be distributed, in any jurisdiction except in accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such
jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws applicable in any jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell any Notes or possess
or distribute this Offering Memorandum, and you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals; neither we nor the Initial
Purchasers (as defined herein) will have any responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements. See “Transfer
_Restrictions.”_

No dealer, salesperson or other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representation not
contained in this Offering Memorandum and, if given or made, any such information or representation must not be relied upon
as having been authorized by the Company, any of its affiliates or the Initial Purchasers (as defined herein) or their respective
affiliates. Neither the delivery of this Offering Memorandum nor any sale made under it shall, under any circumstances, create
any implication that there has been no change in the affairs of the Company since the date of this Offering Memorandum or
that the information contained in this Offering Memorandum is correct as of any time subsequent to that date.

By accepting delivery of this Offering Memorandum, you agree to the foregoing restrictions and not to use any
information herein for any purpose other than considering an investment in the Notes. Investors hereby acknowledge that they
have had an opportunity to request for review, and have received, all additional information they deem necessary to verify the
accuracy and completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Investors also acknowledge that they
have not relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with their investigation of the accuracy of this information or their
decision whether to invest in the Notes.

We have prepared this Offering Memorandum solely for use in connection with the offer of the Notes to QIBs under
Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons (within the meaning of Regulation S) outside the United States under Regulation S. You
agree that you will hold the information contained in this Offering Memorandum and the transactions contemplated hereby in
confidence. You may not distribute this Offering Memorandum to any person, other than a person retained to advise you in
connection with the purchase of any Notes.

The Company reserves the right to withdraw the offering of the Notes at any time. The Company and the Initial
Purchasers reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason or for no reason and to
allot to any prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the Notes sought by such purchaser.

The laws of certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and the offer and sale of
the Notes. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum or any of the Notes come must inform themselves about,
and observe, any such restrictions. None of the Company, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Paying Agent,
the Transfer Agent or the Registrar (each as defined herein) is making any representation to you regarding the legality of an
investment in the Notes, and you should not construe anything in this Offering Memorandum as legal, business, tax or other
advice. You should consult your own advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related aspects of an investment in
the Notes. In making an investment decision regarding any of the Notes, you must rely on your own examination of the Issuer
and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.

which investors purchase, offer or sell the Notes or possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum. Investors must also obtain

the laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction to which investors are subject. None of the Company, its affiliates, the
Trustee or the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates will have any responsibility therefor.

No action has been taken by the Initial Purchasers, the Company or any other person that would permit an offering of

be issued in definitive registered form except under the circumstances described herein. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”
None of the Issuer, Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar, or the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or liability for

in respect of this Offering Memorandum or any such statement.

Memorandum at any time after the date of publication nor any subsequent commitment to purchase the Notes shall, under any
circumstances, create an implication that there has been no change in the information set forth in this Offering Memorandum

The Notes and the Guarantees (as defined herein) have not been and will not be registered with, recommended or
approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) or with any securities regulatory authority of any state

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means
a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended,
“MiFID II”), (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II**
or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”).
Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA**
has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis
that any offer of the Notes in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus
Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus
for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do we or they
authorize, the making of any offer of the Notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial
Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any Initial Purchaser that considers itself as a manufacturer
for the purposes of MiFID II (each a “Manufacturer” and, together, the “Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a
“distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of United Kingdom
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs
**Regulation”) for offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United**
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering, selling or distributing the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum is not being distributed by, nor has it been approved for the purposes of section 21 of the
FSMA by, a person authorized under the FSMA. This Offering Memorandum is for distribution solely to persons who:

Memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons.

reproduced, distributed or otherwise made available in whole or in part to any other person without our prior written consent.
The Notes are not being offered or sold to any person in the United Kingdom, except in circumstances which will not result in
an offer of securities to the public in the United Kingdom within the meaning of Part VI of the FSMA.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer for the purposes of the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) (each a “UK
**Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in**
this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as
defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”) and (ii) all channels for distribution
of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or
recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturer’s target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United Kingdom will be
made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA**

**Financial Information and Operational Data**

**_Company historical financial information_**

This Offering Memorandum includes (i) the English translations of our Spanish language original audited consolidated
financial statements as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 (together, the “Audited Financial
**Statements”) and (ii) the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the three months ended**
March 31, 2024, including comparative financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (the
“Unaudited **Interim Financial Statements” and together with the Audited Financial Statements, the “Financial**
**Statements”). Our historical consolidated financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 presented in**
this Offering Memorandum is derived from the prior-year comparative figures included in the Audited Financial Statements as
of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Financial Statements contained in the F-pages to this Offering Memorandum
should be read in conjunction with the relevant notes thereto.

The Spanish language original versions of the Audited Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS”) and other provisions of the financial
reporting framework applicable in Spain, and were audited by KPMG Auditores, S.L. (“KPMG”), as stated in their audit
reports, English translations of which are included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting” as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board, as adopted by the European Union (“IAS 34”) and were subject to a limited review by KPMG,
as stated in their review report included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Original Spanish-language versions of the
Audited Financial Statements and of the Interim Financial Statements can be found on our website at
[https://www.antolin.com/en/informacion-financiera-eninformacion-financiera-reports. The information included in or linked](https://www.antolin.com/en/informacion-financiera-eninformacion-financiera-reports)
to on our website is not a part of this Offering Memorandum and this website address is not an active hyperlink.

The unaudited financial data for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 included in this Offering Memorandum is
derived by adding the financial data of the Group for the year ended December 31, 2023 to the financial data of the Group for
the three months ended March 31, 2024 and subtracting the financial data of the Group for the three months ended March 31,
2023. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024 has been prepared solely for the
purposes of this Offering Memorandum, is for illustrative purposes only and has not been audited or reviewed by KPMG. As
a result, such information is not necessarily indicative of our results of operations for any future period or our financial condition
at any future date.

**2023 Segment Reporting Change**

From January 1, 2023, we have reduced our number of business segments from three to two, and accordingly split our
operations into traditional business segments named (i) “Product Systems” and (ii) “Technology Solutions”, respectively. Our
“Product Systems” segment encompasses several products such as headliners, doors and hard trim, instrument panels, central
consoles, sun visors, window regulators and trunk parts, and is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard
Trim, (iii) Instrument Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) components & JITs. Our Technology Solutions segment is
comprised of (i) Lighting, (ii) human-machine interface (“HMI”) and (iii) Electronics Systems products.

As a result of this segment reporting change (the “2023 Segment Reporting Change”), the segmental financial
information contained in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the prioryear comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the segmental financial information
contained in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, including
comparative financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, gives effect to the new split of our
business. We did not restate the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 in
order to reflect the 2023 Segment Reporting Change. As a result, the segmental financial information presented in the Audited
Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including the prior-year comparative figures as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2021) is therefore not directly comparable to the segmental financial information presented
in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the prior-year comparative
figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022). For this reason, no segmental financial information as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2021 is presented under “Summary—Summary Financial Information and Other Data,” nor is such
financial information discussed under “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.”

**_Non-IFRS Financial Information_**

This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures that are not audited nor required by, nor
are presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures we present may also be defined differently than the
corresponding terms under the Indenture. We present the following non-IFRS financial measures in this Offering Memorandum
(collectively, the “Non-IFRS Financial Measures”):

      - “EBIT” represents consolidated profit/(loss) for the year/period, before corporate income tax and interest
expenses. EBIT as presented herein differs from “EBIT” as presented in the Financial Statements;

      - “EBITDA” represents EBIT before depreciation and amortization charges. EBITDA as presented herein
differs from “EBITDA” as presented in the Financial Statements;

      - “free cash flow” represents our total net cash flows from operating activities less our capital expenditures;

      - “Financial debt” represents bank loans, debentures and other marketable securities plus non-recourse
factoring and other financial liabilities;

      - “Management EBITDA” represents EBITDA adjusted for gains or losses on the loss of control of
consolidated equity interests, net impairment losses on non-current assets, gains or losses on disposals of
non-current assets, profit of companies accounted for using the equity method, other finance costs, finance
income, exchange difference and profit/(loss) for the year from discontinued operations, net of taxes.
Management EBITDA as presented herein is the same as “EBITDA” as presented in the Financial
Statements;

      - “Management **EBITDA margin” represents Management EBITDA divided by net turnover;**

      - “Net financial debt” represents financial debt less cash and cash equivalents;

      - “Total operating income from ordinary continuing operations” represents our net turnover plus capital
grants and other grants taken to income and other operating revenue; and

      - “Total operating expenses from ordinary continuing operations” represents the sum of our supplies, staff
costs, changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress, depreciation and amortization charges,
variation in provisions for operating allowances, other operating expenses less work performed by the Group
on its assets.

We present the Non-IFRS Financial Measures for information purposes only, because we believe that they and similar
measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity. Our management believes that EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA
margin are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service
debt and because EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin are used by our chief operating
decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business
decisions. EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin are also measures commonly reported
and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations,
EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin exclude depreciation and amortization charges from EBIT
in order to eliminate the impact of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting EBIT, EBITDA,
Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin to enhance the understanding of our historical operating
performance, EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin should not be considered as
substitutes to earnings as an indicator of our operating performance, or as alternatives to cash flows from ordinary operating
activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Management EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, may not
be calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA”, which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the
Notes (see “Description of the Notes”), or for the purposes of any of our other indebtedness.


-----

In addition, we present Financial debt and Net financial debt as financial measures of a company’s debt position. We
believe they are measures widely used by investors in the valuation of the leverage of companies. Credit rating agencies and
lenders use net financial debt to assess net borrowing. Total operating income from ordinary continuing operations is what our
management considers to be a measure of performance, since it provides information on how our business is performing,
starting with net turnover and adding other income related to our ordinary business operations. Total operating expenses from
ordinary continuing operations is considered by our management to be a measure of performance, since it provides information
on how our business is performing, starting with costs directly related to net turnover and including other operating expenses
from our ordinary business operations.

In addition, in this Offering Memorandum, net turnover variance in constant currency is determined by comparing
current period figures, calculated using prior period annual average exchange rates, to the prior period net turnover. The
resulting percentage variance in constant currency is considered to be a Non-IFRS Financial Measure. Net turnover variance
in constant currency calculates net turnover variance without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. We believe that
constant currency variance is an important measure of our operations because it neutralizes foreign exchange impact and
illustrates the underlying change from one year to the next. We believe that this presentation provides a useful period-overperiod comparison as changes due solely to changes in exchange rates are eliminated. Net turnover variance in constant
currency, as defined and presented by us, may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Net turnover
variance in constant currency has limitations, particularly because the currency effects that are eliminated constitute a
significant element of our net turnover and expenses and could impact our performance significantly. We do not evaluate our
results and performance without considering variances in constant currency and changes prepared in accordance with IFRS.
We caution you to follow a similar approach by considering data regarding constant currency period-over-period net turnover
variance only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in
accordance with IFRS. We present the fluctuation derived from IFRS net turnover next to the fluctuation derived from non
IFRS net turnover.

Furthermore, the calculation of the like-for-like net turnover growth presented in this Offering Memorandum is based
on the growth of the net turnover figure from period to period being compared, and at constant exchange rates, for all
subsidiaries that have operated for a period of over twelve months under similar business conditions. A subsidiary is not
considered to have operated under similar business conditions, and therefore does not form part of the like-for-like calculation
basis, in the event that it has been sold, closed or acquired during the period. We use like-for-like comparable net turnover
growth to analyze the evolution of net turnover between periods.

Free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that represents the cash that we generate after cash outflows to support
[operations and maintain our capital assets. It does not represent residual cash flows entirely available for discretionary purposes.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalasset.asp)
This cash can be used for shareholder returns, reducing debt and other investing and/or financing activities.

The Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have limitations as analytical tools and
should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the
limitations of each of these Non-IFRS Financial Measures are:

      - they do not reflect our cash outlays for capital expenditure or contractual commitments;

      - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

      - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments, on our indebtedness;

      - they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay our income taxes;

      - although depreciation and amortization charges and impairment losses on non-current assets are non-cash
charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized and impaired will often have to be replaced in the future,
and the Non- IFRS Financial Measures do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;

      - some of the items that we eliminate in calculating the relevant Non-IFRS Financial Measures reflect cash
payments that were made, or will in the future be made;

      - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of
cash flows; and


-----

      - other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate the Non-IFRS Financial Measures
differently from how they are presented in this Offering Memorandum, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures.

The Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the
reporting requirements of the SEC. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and should not be relied
upon when making an investment decision. You should not consider any of the Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented herein
as substitutes to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as
a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of liquidity. The Non-IFRS Financial Measures are not measures of
financial performance under IFRS. Our computation of the Non-IFRS Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of other companies.

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company's accounting
policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are
significant to the Financial Statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. See “Operating and Financial Review and
_Prospects—Critical Accounting Policies.”_

Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, figures shown as totals in some tables and elsewhere may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of
the figures that precede them.

**Backlog**

In this Offering Memorandum, we present backlog, which we define as forecast revenues through new projects
awarded to Antolin from our customers. The backlog figures presented herein are based on a number of assumptions, including
estimates of the percentage-of-completion of contracts and foreign exchange fluctuations. Factors that could affect the
realization of our backlog as future revenue include cancellations, lower volumes than initially anticipated, scope of work
adjustments, force majeure, legal impediments and default by our customers. Although historically the extent of modifications
and terminations of our orders has not been material compared to our total contract volume and is partially offset by cancellation
penalties, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders, resulting in a decrease of the previously reported
order backlog. Such cancellations or modifications can hence have a significant effect on the revenue we ultimately recognize
from contracts. Backlog gives, at a given date, a picture of the estimated work remaining to complete under contracts in force.
There is no guarantee future execution of the backlog would generate the same levels of margin or cash flow as past execution.
Backlog should therefore not be used as an indication of future results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our
_Business—Our order backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future sales or results of operations.”_

**Industry Data**

In this Offering Memorandum, we rely on and refer to information regarding our business and the market in which
we operate and compete. We have obtained this information from various third party sources, including providers of industry
data, discussions with our customers and our own internal estimates. While we believe that industry publications, surveys and
forecasts are reliable, they have not been independently verified, and neither we nor the Initial Purchasers make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of such information set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

We have generally obtained the market and competitive position data in this Offering Memorandum from industry
publications and from surveys, studies or reports conducted by third-party sources and data providers that we believe to be
reliable. However, the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and has not been independently
verified. Additionally, such studies generally state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable, but the accuracy or completeness of such information is not guaranteed and in some instances the
sources do not assume liability for such information. We have obtained certain of the market and industry data presented in
this Offering Memorandum from reports produced by third-party industry specialists such as LMC, and from information made
publicly available by our competitors and other market participants.


-----

In addition, in many cases, we have made statements in this Offering Memorandum regarding our industry and our
position in the industry based solely on our experience, our internal studies and estimates, and our own investigation of market
conditions. While we assume that our own market observations are reliable, we give no warranty for the accuracy of our own
estimates and the information derived from them. They may differ from estimates made by our competitors or from future
studies conducted by market research institutes or other independent sources. While we are not aware of any misstatements
regarding the industry or similar data presented herein, such data involves risks and uncertainties and are subject to change
based on various factors. See “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. Additionally, all data in relation to our position in
our industry as well as specific market share details are derived from estimates made by the management of the Group, which
are believed to be reasonable, based on the number of units of automotive interior components sold.

We cannot assure you that any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly reflect our position in the industry, and
none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent sources. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers
make any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of this information. Some of the surveys or sources
were compiled by our advisors and are not publicly available and accordingly may not be considered to be as independent as
other third party sources.

**Our Company**

We are a leading Tier 1 designer, developer, manufacturer and supplier of automotive interior components, offering
multi-technology solutions within (x) our Product Systems segment, including the (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard Trim, (iii)
Instrument Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) Components and JITs divisions, as well as (y) our Technology Solutions
segment, including (i) Lighting, (ii) HMI and (iii) Electronics Systems, for sale to OEMs. We have a geographically diversified
platform of 118 manufacturing plants and JIT assembly and sequencing facilities, as well as 26 technical-commercial offices,
or TCOs, in 25 countries worldwide as of December 31, 2023. We supplied our products globally to over 100 different
automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs in 2023. We provided components for more than 600 different vehicle
models, representing approximately one out of every three vehicles manufactured worldwide. Our product, geographical and
customer diversification allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, in particular our presence in Eastern
Europe, North America, South America and Asia, which in the past has mitigated the impact of regional production fluctuations
on our business during periods of economic downturn. We are headquartered in Burgos, Spain, and in 2023 our average number
of employees was approximately 23,000.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated a net turnover of €4,617.4 million, consolidated profit for the
year of €12.6 million and a Management EBITDA of €328.4 million, representing increases of 3.7% (or 5.3% on a constant
currency basis), 106.0% and 10.5%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended
March 31, 2024, we generated a net turnover of €1,039.3 million, consolidated profit for the period of €0.1 million and a
Management EBITDA of €82.8 million, representing a decrease of 10.1% (or 6.6% on a constant currency basis), an increase
of 101.0% and an increase of 19.5%, respectively, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

We organize our activities around two business segments: Product Systems and Technology Solutions. In addition,
we also review our results of operations on a geographical basis.

**_Product Systems_**

Our Product Systems segment is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard Trim, (iii) Instrument
Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) Components and JITs.

  - _Headliners: we are a leader in the manufacturing of headliner modular solutions, incorporating acoustic, safety,_
panoramic and lighting functionalities with a strong sustainability focus. We cover the entire product spectrum for
overhead systems, from the headliner substrate to more complex modular systems. We use key technologies for
headliner substrates and benefit from full vertical integration, from the core polyurethane foam production to the final
assembly of the overhead systems. Net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Headliners
division amounted to €1,135.8 million and €103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which
represented 25% and 23% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and
Management segment EBITDA, respectively, for that same period. In 2023, we were a global leader in overhead
systems, with approximately 22% of the global market share. We achieved a leading position across most regions in

airbag systems, among others. The instrument panel is a key element of the cockpit module and is comprised of a
sophisticated system of trims, foams, composites, and metals. The central consoles are designed and manufactured to
operate vehicle functions and store items. The primary technologies and processes involved in the manufacturing of
these systems include low pressure and injection molding, compression molding, vacuum forming, slush skins, spray
urethane and decorative stitching. Net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to this division
amounted to €544.0 million and €47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented
12% and 11% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management

amounted to €725.3 million and €47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented
16% and 11% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management
segment EBITDA, respectively, for that same period. In 2023, we were a leading producer of window regulators in
Europe with a market share of 23%. We were also a significant producer of window regulators in South America with
a market share of over 17%. Our global market share for window regulars was approximately 6% in 2023. In sun
visors, we were a leader in the European market with a market share of 31% in 2023. Our global market share in sun
visors was approximately 12% for the same year. As of December 31, 2023, the components & JITs division included
26 manufacturing facilities.

Our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Product Systems segment amounted to
€4,213.0 million and €395.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented 91.3% and 88.2%
of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA for
that same period, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net turnover and Management segment
EBITDA attributable to our Product Systems segment amounted to €940.6 million and €86.2 million, respectively, which
represented 90.6% and 82.1% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and
Management segment EBITDA for that same period, respectively.

This represents an 11.9% decrease in net turnover and a 7.2% increase in Management segment EBITDA, compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2023, when the net turnover and the Management segment EBITDA attributable to our
Product Systems segment amounted to €1,067.1 million and €80.4 million, respectively. In 2023, we were a leader in overhead
systems, with approximately 22% of the global market share. Our market shares for overhead systems in Europe & ROW,
North America and Asia in 2023 were 38%, 31% and 12%, respectively. In sun visors, we were a leader in Europe & ROW

**_Technology Solutions_**

Our Technology Solutions segment includes (i) Lighting, (ii) HMI and (iii) Electronics Systems products.

Our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Technology Solutions segment amounted to
€400.1 million and €53.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented 8.7% and 11.8% of
our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA for the
same period, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA
attributable to our Technology Solutions segment amounted to €97.3 million and €18.8 million, respectively, which represented
9.4% and 17.9% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment
EBITDA for the same period, respectively. These figures represent a 9.9% increase in net turnover and a 27.9% increase in
Management segment EBITDA compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, when the net turnover and Management
segment EBITDA attributable to our Technology Solutions segment were €88.5 million and €14.7 million & ROW,
respectively. In 2023 we were a leading manufacturer of interior automotive lighting components in Europe, with a market
share of overhead front consoles and dome lamps of 31% in 2023, and a relevant supplier in the ambient light segment,
especially for premium vehicles. We believe we also had a leading market share in lighting components in North America
amounting to approximately 19% for the same year, and a market share in Asia of 4%, which we expect to be a geographical
area of focus for the Group in the coming years. As of December 31, 2023, our Technology Solutions segment included 15
manufacturing facilities.

The charts below show the percentage of net turnover and Management segment EBITDA derived per business
segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 (excluding “others”):

Net turnover in 2023 Management segment EBITDA in 2023

We believe that our financial and operational success and stability have been, and continue to be, driven by our
strategic, customer-focused geographical growth and diversified net turnover streams, as well as our manufacturing, process,
design and technological expertise. We believe that these factors have allowed us to achieve our position as a leading global
supplier in the automotive industry, with high strategic importance to many of the largest OEMs. See “Summary—Summary
_Financial Information and Other Data,_ _Summary—Segmental Information of the Company” for a summary of the operating_
performance of the Group’s geographical segments.

**Our Key Strengths**

We believe that our global footprint, proven track-record, successful and longstanding relationships with automakers
and OEMs, extensive capabilities and deep expertise in a number of technologies and products, provide us with the following
competitive strengths in comparison to our peers:

Additionally, OEMs face substantial switching costs from operational, technical and logistical perspectives in
replacing the supplier of a particular component or system during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model. As a result, the
supplier of a component for a specific car model is often also appointed for the next generations of that model. This is mostly
due to the long lead-time and large investment required to set up the production and supply processes, and to the scale
operational efficiencies gained through experience with the lean manufacturing of certain products. We believe that such
switching costs, together with our technological capabilities, strongly protect our leading market position.

**_Highly diversified business model_**

_Regional diversification_

We have a geographically diversified platform of 118 manufacturing plants and JIT assembly and sequencing
facilities, as well as 26 TCOs across 25 countries as of December 31, 2023. We supplied our products around the world to over
100 different automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs in 2023. We provided components for more than 600
different vehicle models. Given the nature of our products, geographical and customer diversification allow us to take advantage
of global growth opportunities, in particular owing to our presence in Eastern Europe, North America, South America and Asia,
which in the past has mitigated the impact of regional production fluctuations on our business during periods of economic
downturn.

We are a truly global player who has committed substantial investment to, and has a well-established presence in,
growth markets. We believe we are a market leader measured by units of production in many of these markets, which gives us
a competitive advantage over other players. Furthermore, our net turnover from our Asia operations has increased from €82.2
million in 2010 to €756.1 million in 2023, representing 16.4% of our net turnover in 2023. Our Management EBITDA increased
by 19.5%, or €13.5 million, to €82.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €69.3 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2023. Our Management segment EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included (i) €55.4
million attributable to Europe & ROW (compared to €50.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023), (ii) €23.5
million attributable to North America (compared to €23.5 million for the thee months ended March 31, 2023) and (iii) €26.0
million attributable to Asia (compared to €21.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023).

As part of our customer-focused approach to our expansion strategy, we have proactively coordinated our expansion
plans into growth markets with those OEMs to whom we supply. When an OEM customer expands into a new market or
location, we determine whether it is in our strategic interest to also open a facility in such location. Furthermore, our strong
geographical diversification allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities and mitigates the impact of regional
demand fluctuations on our business during economic downturns. The following charts show the evolution of our geographical
net turnover breakdown between 2010 (€1,637 million) and 2023 (€4,617.4 million):

_Customer diversification_

Relative to our competitors, we have a well-diversified customer base which, through a successful development
strategy, has improved across models and now supplies products globally to over 100 different automotive brands belonging
to approximately 50 OEMs in 2023. Our OEM customers include Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Ford, Mercedes Benz, Tata
Motors, BMW Group, General Motors, Renault-Nissan, among others.

The net turnover received from our five largest customers, Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and
Tata Motors—Jaguar Land Rover, represented 65.4% of total net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was
lower than their share of our total net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2022 (67.0%), and 65.7% of the total net
turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was lower than their relative share of total net turnover for the
three months ended March 31, 2023 (67.1%). Additionally, we have a diverse set of customers for each of our products and no
single OEM is the largest customer by net turnover in both our business segments. The following charts show the evolution of
our net turnover by customer as a percentage of our total net turnover between 2010 and 2023:

Customer diversification in 2010 Customer diversification in 2023

_Product diversification_

Our historic product portfolio has been comprised primarily of headliners, doors and interior plastics, lighting and,
since 2015, cockpit modules. The following charts show the evolution of our net turnover by product as a percentage of our
total net turnover between 2010 and 2023 and the shift towards high-margin products resulting therefrom:

**_Long-standing contractual customer relationships_**

We have strategic and long-standing relationships with our OEM customers, which are based on many years of deeply
established and successful collaboration. Our scale and ability to develop differentiated solutions for our OEM customers on a
global scale are critical to our success and differentiate us from local and regional suppliers of automotive components.

Our global presence enables us to manufacture, assemble and sequence our products in our plants and JIT facilities,
which are located close to OEMs around the world. This allows for JIT delivery systems on a global scale and on a consistent
and high-quality basis, making us a clear choice for global OEMs.

Our well-developed technological capabilities, global manufacturing footprint and proximity to OEMs, operational
scale and track record of financial performance enable us to supply products to support an OEM throughout the full product
life cycle. Additionally, we often act as a development partner during the initial stages of product development which allow us
to recommend and incorporate our products into potential designs well in advance of any formal orders from our OEM
customers. Our ability to support the development process of OEMs and work as an outsourcing partner to them all over the
world is a significant differentiator, in particular on new product solutions, and would take large investments and a long time
to replicate, thereby making us a preferred partner to the leading OEMs in the industry.

Our ability to maintain our competitive advantages and technological leadership has resulted in strong customer
relationships and translates into a consolidated customer base with our top five OEM customers representing 65.4% of net
turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023. The relationships with key customers are long-standing and the sales from our
top five OEM customers amounted to €3,019.8 million in 2023.

**_Attractive market fundamentals_**

According to different estimations from market data analysis and research providers, such as LMC, the global
automotive production industry is expected to increase by approximately 3.0% in 2024 to reach a production volume of up to
89.2 million of light vehicles. In terms of regions, Asia, North America and Europe were our largest markets as of December 31,
2023. The interior components market in which we operate is expected to outperform other sectors in the automotive industry
due to the increasing interior component content per vehicle. This trend is driven by growing comfort requirements of
consumers and rising technological demands from OEMs related to weight savings and noise and vibration insulation, as well
as the increase in electronics, functional and ambient lighting, smart surfaces, and on-demand technology compared to other
traditional automotive sectors.

We are in a strong position to continue to benefit from ongoing consolidation and supplier concentration in our market
due to our competitive cost base and resulting strong profitability, worldwide presence, leading technological capabilities and
solid financial position. As OEMs continue to introduce global platforms and modular toolkits as a basis for a large number of
car models, they are more interested in working with global suppliers with strong development capabilities which can support
them across their international operations.

**_Strong innovation track record_**

The automotive industry has a growing focus on innovation, due to continuously increasing customer expectations
and the need to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements. Our commitment to developing innovative and high
quality products has defined our approach to our OEM customers. Many of our products are designed and manufactured using
state-of-the-art technologies to implement new functionalities on board the vehicle that provide higher standards of safety,
perceived quality and comfort while also focusing on weight reduction and cost optimization objectives as critical factors
inherent to the automotive sector.

Over the last few years, we have continuously invested in R&D, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our total
R&D spending amounted to €118.2 million or 2.6% of our net turnover. This level of R&D spending allows us to respond to
the growing demand and requirements of OEMs for products at the forefront of technical innovation. As of December 31, 2023,
we had a dedicated team of 1,622 employees (or 7.0% of our total employees) in engineering functions throughout R&D, design
and calculation engineering, advanced manufacturing and quality control processes, supporting our product innovation
capabilities, as compared to 655 employees in these functions in 2011 (or 5.2% of our total employees).

In recent years, and particularly in 2023, Grupo Antolin’s innovation activities were focused on building up our global
capabilities within the electronic systems/HMI arena in order to provide our clients with innovative technological solutions for
car interiors, to help us improve the overall profitability of the business, be more resilient to industry downturns and increase
our product portfolio and client base. On one hand, we have continued to provide creative responses to the trends that
continually redefine the concept of mobility on a global scale (such as the new CASE+P trends). On the other hand, we have
signed strategic partnerships to further penetrate into high-growth and profitable segments, including geographies such as
China, which are expected to continue delivering business opportunities in the future. For instance, we have recently launched
Antolin joint MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program in order to further our connection to elite schools and universities, and also
started collaborating with up-and-coming players in the automotive industry such as VIA optronics for the development of
innovative integrated display systems for vehicle interiors, trinamiX for the integration of secure access systems with face
authentication in vehicle trim and PersiSKIN for the development and supply of vegetal skin for interior vehicle trim.

In this regard, we are prioritizing those programs aimed at technologically enhancing our products through the
development of new functionalities and of processes which improve our efficiency and competitiveness. These programs
include:

    - Vehicle interior as a living space: this program focuses on the research and development of new
functionalities to enrich the feelings of thermal comfort, including research on audio functions and the study
of their implications in the design of components, as well as air purification and the disinfection of on-board
surfaces.

    - New safety and driving assistance functions: this program focuses on active safety aspects and includes the
validation of corrective lighting functions with which to improve visual capabilities during night driving.
Technologies that generate holographic warning signs for the driver are also being researched, as well as new
translucent optical surfaces that increase their protection against glare;

    - Optimization of performance and new features: this program focuses on the development of new alternative
materials to natural leather and synthetic leather for lining purposes, as well as algorithms to model the
behavior of interior surfaces in different lighting scenarios;

    - New forms of HMI interaction: this program looks to capitalize on our belief that autonomous vehicles will
be one of the pillars of the future of mobility, together with electric vehicles, hydrogen batteries and high
autonomy driver-assistance systems; and

    - Digital Strategy and Industry 4.0.: this program focuses aspects of advanced manufacturing pursuant to which
we can deploy our global digitization strategy, with the aim of improving the sustainability, efficiency,
flexibility and industrial competitiveness of Antolin.

profitable growth strategy.

With the leadership of our dedicated and experienced management, we have also proven our ability to effectively
integrate, manage and improve the state of acquired businesses.

**Our Strategies**

Our mission is to be a crucial strategic partner for our OEM customers around the world and across all of our products
while evolving our business portfolio with presence in high-growth markets, increasing our profitability and ensuring our
commitment to science-based targets through our continued focus on sustainability. The strategies to achieve our mission are
based on innovation, flexibility, customer focused growth and further geographic, product and customer diversification, while
maintaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction and continuing to successfully deliver on our strategic plan. We intend
to achieve this by pursuing the following strategies:

**_Continue to be an innovation leader through R&D_**

To remain competitive in the new automotive market, we have worked to enhance our value proposition, which
involves an evolution of the product offering as well as our manufacturing processes and the marketing and distribution to our
customers. Beyond our capacity as a specialized plastics processing company, we have the opportunity to position Grupo
Antolin as an efficient integrator of technologically complex and innovative solutions in the fields of electronics and lighting
for interior components. Thus, in addition to enhancing the value of our products, we expect to be able to meet customers’
requirements to have interlocutors capable of providing multi-technology solutions for larger vehicle platforms, and with whom
we will collaborate starting in the earliest stages of development.

Our objective is to be a smart integrator and a leading innovator in the automotive interior components industry. High
consumer expectations, environmental goals and regulatory changes are three of the main drivers in the automotive market.
We are involved in the design of highly innovative cars as a result of our focus on four main areas:

    - _Materials and Processes: Our materials are designed to generate surfaces which are high quality, have improved_
performance with intensive use and are compatible with the integration of electronic and lighting functions. We
also take into account environmental considerations through the development of more sustainable solutions based
on the use of natural materials, the use of greater proportions of recycled material and the fulfilment of lightweighting objectives to contribute to the reduction of consumption and emissions.

    - _Mobility of the future: We focus on the design of new vehicle interiors and the incorporation of intelligent surfaces_
and advanced functionalities on board the vehicle. This includes the development of new interior concepts to
address the preferences of users in different regions of the world in distinctive ways. It also includes the
development of studies based on user experience for the optimization of visual, thermal and acoustic comfort
aspects.

    - _Electronic functions and technological solutions: Our electronic functions and technological solutions are based_
on the development of hardware and software solutions for the control of functions related to dynamic lighting,
driving assistance, connectivity, infotainment and HMI, among others.

    - _Smart product integration: We engage in researching functions for advanced vehicle interior components and_
mechanism design and automation. The integration includes not only the aspects related to the functionality of
the product, but also its constructive aspects, simplifying architecture and manufacturing or assembly processes
to achieve cost and competitiveness improvements.

_Effects of the CASE+P Model in the global auto market: The global automotive industry is being shaped and heavily_
impacted by the increasing importance of technological shifts in recent years, as well as by significant changes in customer
demands and needs precipitated by recent lifestyle changes. Currently, the vast majority of car models marketed have innovative
technologies aimed at facilitating and improving the driving experience, as well as providing additional safety features to users.
Automobiles are expected to become increasingly connected, autonomous, shared, electric and personalized, thus opening a
broad range of new possibilities and business opportunities for those companies which are well positioned and have global
capabilities. Our long-term strategic plan is focused on increasing the capabilities within our Technology Solutions segment in
order to become a leading smart systems integrator and provider of innovative technological solutions to our clients. Our aim
is to continue improving our global profitability and increase our customer base.

**_Become a global full-service supplier to OEMs_**

We intend to strengthen our position as a Tier 1 supplier for automobile interiors with an extensive production and
supply network that can flexibly service our customers on a global basis, providing major OEMs access to our global platform
and product portfolio. In addition, we hope to increasingly take on additional responsibilities and activities of OEMs by
managing Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers, thereby improving the manufacturing and product development efforts of our customers.

Our approach to project and production management is increasingly focused on integral execution by locating our
technical and manufacturing facilities close to the decision-making and manufacturing centers of our customers. Additionally,
we aim to ensure engineering benchmarking, continuous improvements in operational excellence and standardization of
processes in every country in which we operate. We intend to develop new industrial processes able to produce different
products with the same investment.

**_Evolving our business portfolio with a focus on high-margin products and presence in high-growth markets_**

We intend to deploy several key initiatives in relation to our products and our geographies in order to accelerate our
growth.

In relation to our products, our aim is to deploy initiatives for both our Technology Solutions segment and, to a lesser
extent, our Product Systems segment, in each case in order to focus on high-margin products and divest non-core ones. As part
of our Technology Solutions segment, we are committed to developing our offering of integrated solutions with other business
units in order to avoid commoditization. We have entered into strategic partnerships in order to bolster our offering of
innovative technological solutions, including in connection with smart touch and display technologies. For instance, our joint
venture with AED Vantage Group (formerly known as Matoma Capital), which specializes in the development and production
of embedded electronic systems for the automotive sector, has allowed us to strengthen our Electronic Systems products, which
we consider to be a key pillar in order to consolidate our position as a global provider of in-car technological solutions. In order
to achieve further growth within our Technology Solutions system, we expect to consider further transactions via selective,
value-enhancing strategic joint ventures and alliances (but excluding material acquisitions), in line with our overall growth
plan. We also plan to leverage our global footprint in order to develop a global engineering model, as opposed to independent
regional teams, with a view to deploying our Technology Solutions across all of our markets. As part of our Product Systems
segment, we intend to focus on value-added solutions in order to strengthen our leadership in the manufacturing of headliner
modular solutions. We will also consider, if deemed accretive, strategic alliances with logistics operators in order to standardize
and automate our industrial processes while concentrating our production. As a result of these initiatives, we expect that our
Technology Solutions segment will represent a larger share of our net turnover by 2027.

In relation to our geographies, we have increased, and plan to continue to increase our presence in Asia consistently
with the development trend of the automotive market in the region. Asia continues to be a significant contributor to margin
expansion. Our net turnover derived from the Asia region has increased from €82.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2010 to €756.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of
growth opportunities in Asia as a result of our existing footprint of high-quality production facilities in the region. We intend
to capitalize on our current operations and reputation to increase our presence in the region through selective and disciplined
investments and partnerships. For example, we have four TCOs and we operate 22 sites in China as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum. We also have two TCOs and six operating sites in India, where we plan to further increase our market share of
electronic systems while also maintaining our leadership in headliners. We believe that our expansion plans in South-East Asia
and Asia in general will allow us to serve customers who will be future global leaders in the automotive industry. In addition
to Asia, we also plan to adapt our presence in Europe by targeting new OEMs entering the EU and focusing on competitive
production countries, as well as in North America by targeting faster-growing new segments for us such as pick-up trucks and
establishing new partnerships with local suppliers to enhance our value proposition. As a result of these initiatives, we expect
that the net turnover generated by Asia as a percentage of our total net turnover will increase, while the net turnover generated
by Europe as a percentage of our total net turnover will decrease.

**_Optimize our financial performance through the implementation of our strategic plan in order to improve our cash_**
**_flow profile and our liquidity_**

We aim to continue implementing our strategic plan in order to enhance our profitability through higher profit margins
and further improve our cash flow profile and liquidity. As part of our strategic plan, we expect to continue optimizing our
footprint and rightsizing our business operations through productivity improvement resulting from advanced manufacturing
processes. In addition, we also intend to continue enhancing direct labor efficiency through automation, as well as indirect
labor efficiency through structural streamlining. In November 2023, we disposed of Antolin Austria Holding and our associated
product systems division in Austria. Our aim is to reduce our current footprint by up to 15% and we expect to achieve liquidity
of approximately €150 million through selective asset sales, with identified potential for additional gains by completing further
divestments in our current pipeline. We also intend to further optimize our footprint by continuing to increase our operations
in low-cost countries in Eastern Europe and North America in order to streamline our operations and reduce our cost base. As
of March 31, 2024, our total workforce included approximately 25,000 workers, compared to 27,000 workers as of December
31, 2023 and 29,000 workers as of December 31, 2022.

In addition, we have changed our project selection method by switching away from a volume-based approach and
instead focusing on internal rate of return payback and capital expenditures as a percentage of net turnover, as well as
renegotiating development projects and removing target projects with lower scores. We plan on continuing implementing our
new approach towards project selection across all of our operations in order to reduce our capital expenditures, with an
estimated 659 projects currently under review. Our new quoting system is expected to further boost the profitability of our
order intakes and will be coupled with a high level of already booked sales, with an estimated backlog of €17.0 billion until
2027 (driven by €7 billion of order intakes in 2022 and €5.5 billion of order intakes in 2023), which represents approximately
85% of our component sales target for the same period. Of our estimated €17.0 billion of backlog, we currently estimate that
(i) between approximately 85% to 90% will be within our Product Systems segment, with the remainder within our Technology
Systems segment, and (ii) between approximately 35% to 40% will be in North America, 15% to 20% will be in Asia and the
remainder will be in Europe & ROW. As a result, we expect that the implementation of our business plan will allow us to
benefit from a sustainable, profitable and diversified growth in the medium term. We envisage operating with limited leverage
through a disciplined financial strategy adapted to our long-term growth needs, which we believe will allow us to achieve a
ratio of adjusted net financial debt to Management EBITDA of 1.5x or less, as well as double digit Management EBITDA
margin.

Our ability to achieve the financial targets and objectives set out above is subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and our financial targets and objectives
have been developed based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions and conditions that are subject to change.
As a result, our actual results may vary from the financial targets and objectives set out above, and those variations may be
material. We do not undertake to publish revised financial targets and objectives to reflect events or circumstances existing or
arising after the date of the Offering Memorandum or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may fail to achieve the targeted benefits from our strategic plan,” “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our order backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future sales or results of_
_operations” and “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data—Backlog.” Certain of the foregoing are forward-_
looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”

**_Continuing to follow advanced ESG practices and strategies_**

We are also committed to adopting and continuing to follow ESG principles, including adherence to objectives by
Science Based Targets (SBTi). Our objective is to renew and enhance our continued focus on the environment by becoming a
carbon neutral company by 2040, including a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2028 compared to 2019 levels. We are also
focused on becoming a circular business by aiming to create supply chains that recover or recycle the resources used to create
our products, thereby reducing our environmental footprint. For instance, we use ecodesign in order to systematically
incorporate environmental considerations into the design process of our products, and are also aiming to decrease our nonhazardous waste by 10% in 2028 compared to 2019 levels.

We are also committed to integrating and encouraging management to contribute to generating a responsible culture
of transparency, ethics and compliance that promotes a safe and healthy work environment. We have voluntarily adopted a
number of good governance standards applicable to Spanish listed companies. Our Corporate Governance Model is made up
of a set of rules and principles that ensure the proper functioning of our governing and administrative bodies. In addition to
mandatory corporate responsibility policies, our Corporate Governance Model includes a separate code of ethics and conduct,
certain corporate policies (Compliance Policy, Gifts and Hospitality Policy and Anti-Corruption Policy) and other internal
codes, processes and procedures required or recommended through sector-related provisions. Our management model enables
Grupo Antolin to meet the requirements of several international management system standards and internal management needs
(e.g., ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management Systems, UNE 19601 Management System for Criminal Compliance).

Additionally, we continually work to improve our corporate governance structure and conducted several activities in
2023 including, among others, the update of commitments and approval of corporate policies on compliance, anti-corruption,
corporate social responsibility and human rights, as well as those related to the environment and energy. We are committed
and will continue to commit to the promotion of a diverse and inclusive work culture focused on knowledge, skills and
experiences that drive societal development.

    - _Moroccan sale and leaseback:_ we have signed a binding commitment to sale and leaseback transaction in
Morocco for €4.2 million in connection with a manufacturing facility located in Tangier. The lease signed

The aggregate consideration in connection with the Divestment Transactions totals €100 million, of which €18 million
have already been received, with the remainder expected to be received during the second half of 2024. This represents more
than 65% of our target to achieve €150 million of additional liquidity through asset disposals by 2025. In addition, on July 11,
2024, we closed the sale of a manufacturing plant located in the United States for approximately €11.7 million (equivalent).
Pursuant to this sale, we will lease the manufacturing plant from the acquiror, without the right to acquire the asset at the end
of the lease term. As part of our ongoing divestment plans, we may enter into further strategic divestment and/or sale and
leaseback transactions from time to time.

_Current trading_

Our net turnover for the twelve months ended May 31, 2024, amounted to €4,452.3 million, which is 5.9% lower than
our net turnover for the twelve months ended May 31, 2023 (€4,733.1 million), and our Management EBITDA for the twelve
months ended May 31, 2024 amounted to €357.3 million (representing a Management EBITDA margin of 8.0%), which is
16.6% higher than our Management EBITDA for the twelve months ended May 31, 2023 (€306.5 million, representing a
Management EBITDA margin of 6.5%). Our net turnover for the five months ended May 31, 2024 amounted to €1,780.9
million, which is 8.5% lower than our net turnover for the five months ended May 31, 2023 (€1,946.1 million), and that our
Management EBITDA for the five months ended May 31, 2024 amounted to €144.0 million (representing a Management
EBITDA margin of 8.1%), which is 25.0% higher than our Management EBITDA for the five months ended May 31, 2023
(€115.2 million, representing a Management EBITDA margin of 5.9%). The increase in Management EBITDA is primarily
attributable to our strategic plan for the 2023-2026 period, with a focus on rightsizing, footprint optimization, industrial
operational excellence and customer centricity.

**SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**

The following diagram summarizes certain aspects of our corporate structure and financing after giving effect to the
Transactions. All entities shown below are 100% owned (ignoring any de minimis shareholdings) unless otherwise indicated.
The chart does not include all entities in our Group or all of the debt obligations thereof. For a summary of the debt obligations
identified in this diagram, see “Description of the Notes,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.”

(1) HoldCo holds 100.0% of the shares of the Company and is wholly owned by the Antolín family through different holding vehicles, including Avot
Inversiones, S.L.

(2) On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will rank equally in right of payment
with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt and senior to any of its existing or future subordinated debt. The Notes will be general
senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security” and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment
with all existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated to the Notes, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the
EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness
that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness and
(iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

(3) On the 2028 Notes Issue Date, the Issuer issued the 2028 Notes, which comprise €390.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Notes due 2028, which were issued by the Company pursuant to the 2028 Notes Indenture. An aggregate principal amount of €9.7 million of the
2028 Notes was repurchased by the Company pursuant to an open market transaction in July 2022 and, as a result, an aggregate principal amount
of €380.3 million of the 2028 Notes remain outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—
_2028 Notes.”_

(4) As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Senior Facilities Agreement provided for Facility A in an aggregate principal
amount of €338.1 million and the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €193.6 million (€4.5 million of which has been
utilized as ancillary facilities), €130.0 million of which was drawn as of March 31, 2024. For further details, see “Capitalization” and “Description
_of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”. The A&E will become effective pursuant to the ARA on the A&E Effective Date. See_
“Summary—Recent Developments— Amendment and Extension of the Senior Facilities.”

14


-----

(5) We have additional bank and other debt, which has been incurred and guaranteed by the Company and several of our subsidiaries, including the
Guarantors. As of March 31, 2024, as adjusted for the Transactions, we would have had €1,494.8 million of financial debt, and subsidiaries of the
Company that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €21.8 million of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis. See “Capitalization” and
“Description of Other Indebtedness”.

(6) The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the Company’s
obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility and (ii) within 120 days from the Issue Date
(subject to the satisfaction of applicable local law formalities and the Agreed Security Principles), by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which
will also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, provided
that such Guarantors’ Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of
_Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.” The Guarantee to be provided by Grupo Antolin South Africa (PTY) Ltd within 120 days from the Issue_
Date requires the approval of the FinSurv. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—Not all of the Guarantees will initially guarantee the
_Notes.” The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with_
all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated to that Guarantor’s Guarantee, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior
Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and any guarantees thereof, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all of such Guarantor’s
existing and future indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets
securing such indebtedness and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries
that do not guarantee the Notes. The Guarantors, together with the Company, represent 54.3% and 64.2% of the Group’s total Management EBITDA
and net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. See “—The Offering—Guarantors”. We believe the Guarantors represent
all entities within the Group that are suitable to provide meaningful credit support in light of local law guarantee limitations and/or requirements
applicable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that might make it difficult or otherwise impracticable to provide a meaningful guarantee
and increase in substance the coverage of the Group’s total Management EBITDA and net turnover.

(7) Within 120 days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Collateral. Notwithstanding the fact that the Notes will be secured by a
pledge numerically successive to the pledges securing the existing senior secured debt, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received
upon enforcement of the Collateral will be applied _pro rata in repayment of the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the_
COFIDES Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”. The Collateral also secures the Senior Facilities, the 2028
Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, ranking pari passu with the security granted for the benefit of the lenders pursuant to the
Senior Facilities, the holders of the 2028 Notes, the lenders pursuant to the EIB Facilities and the lenders pursuant to the COFIDES Facility. The
Collateral will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, and may be released under certain circumstances. The laws of Spain limit the
amount of obligations that may be guaranteed, or in respect of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of the
Guarantees and the security securing the Notes and the Guarantees. For more information on limitations to the validity and enforceability of the
Guarantees and the security interests in the Collateral and the liability of the Guarantors and the security providers, see “Risk Factors—Risks related
_to the Notes” and “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.”_

**Optional Redemption ...................... The Company may redeem all or part of the Notes at any time on or after   ,**

40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes with the net cash proceeds from

Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
redeemed plus a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

**Optional Tax Redemption .............. The Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, if changes**
in tax laws would require the Company to pay additional amounts on the Notes. If the
Company decides to redeem the Notes following such a change in tax laws, the
Company must redeem all the Notes at a price equal to the principal amount of the
Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of
redemption. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Tax Redemption”.

**Additional Amounts ........................ All payments in respect of the Notes or any Guarantee will be made without**

withholding agent is required by law to withhold or deduct any amount for taxes
imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined herein) in respect of payments
on the Notes or any Guarantee, subject to certain exceptions, we will pay the
additional amounts necessary so that the net amount received by the beneficial owners
of Notes after the withholding or deduction (including any withholding or deduction

received had there been no deduction or withholding. See “Description of the Notes—
_Additional Amounts”._

repurchase the Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal

connection with such event. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option
_of Holders—Change of Control”._

**Certain Covenants** ........................... The Indenture governing the Notes will, among others, limit our ability to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional debt and issue preferred stock;

                   - make certain payments, including dividends or other distributions;

                   - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint

Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF in accordance with its
rules, there are no assurances that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted
to trade on the Euro MTF. Further, the Notes will be new securities for which there
will be no established market. Although the Initial Purchasers have informed us that
they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they
may discontinue market making at any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot
assure you that a liquid market for the Notes will develop or be maintained.

**Use of Proceeds ................................ We estimate that the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be €250.0 million.**
On the Issue Date, we intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash
on balance sheet, to (i) redeem or repurchase the entire outstanding amount of the

_are significant to the Financial Statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. See “Operating and Financial review_

(2) EBIT represents consolidated profit/(loss) for the year/period (as applicable), before corporate income tax and interest expenses. EBITDA represents
EBIT before depreciation and amortization charges. Management EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for gains or losses on the loss of control
of consolidated equity interests, net impairment losses on non-current assets, gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets, profit of companies
accounted for using the equity method, other finance costs, finance income, exchange difference and profit/(loss) for the year from discontinued
operations, net of taxes. Our management believes that EBIT, EBITDA and Management EBITDA are meaningful for investors because they
provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBIT, EBITDA and Management EBITDA are
used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business
decisions. EBIT, EBITDA and Management EBITDA are also measures commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other
interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, EBITDA and Management EBITDA exclude depreciation and
amortization charges from EBIT in order to eliminate the impact of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting EBIT,
EBITDA and Management EBITDA to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, EBIT, EBITDA and Management
EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes to earnings as an indicator of our operating performance, or as alternatives to cash flows from
ordinary operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Management EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, may not be
calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA”, which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes (see “Description of
the Notes”), or for the purposes of any of our other indebtedness. The following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated profit/(loss) for
the year/period (as applicable) to EBIT, EBITDA and Management EBITDA for the relevant periods:

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to_
_invest in the Notes. Set out below are certain risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial_
_condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects. The factors discussed below should not be regarded as a complete and_
_comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. In assessing these factors, you should also refer to the other_
_information contained in this Offering Memorandum, including the Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere_
_in this Offering Memorandum. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are not aware or that we believe are immaterial_
_may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects. If any of these events_
_occur, our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or prospects could be materially and adversely affected._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including_
_the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to our Business**

**_The automobile industry is cyclical and cyclical downturns in our business segments negatively impact our_**
**_business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

The volume of automotive production and the level of new vehicle purchases regionally and worldwide are cyclical
and have fluctuated, sometimes significantly from year-to-year. These fluctuations are caused by such factors as general
economic conditions, interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences (including the effects of the increase of the
use of shared cars and mobility services), patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle, and
such fluctuations give rise to changes in demand for our products and may have a significant adverse impact on our results of
operations. In addition, OEM customers generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities from their suppliers. As
our business has certain fixed costs that must be met regardless of demand for our products, cyclical downturns can further
affect our results of operations.

The highly cyclical and fluctuating nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside and beyond our
control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot predict can and have impacted
cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or in the demand for automobiles incorporating our
products in particular, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash
flows.

**_We are susceptible to economic trends, and deterioration of economic conditions could adversely impact our_**
**_business and exacerbate the difficulties experienced by our customers and suppliers in obtaining financing._**

A significant economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business. Continued concerns about the
systemic impact of a potential long-term and wide-spread recession, energy costs, strong currency fluctuations, the availability
and cost of credit, diminished business and consumer confidence and increased persistent unemployment in Europe have
contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies, including in the
jurisdictions in which we operate.

In addition, any increased financial instability may lead to longer-term disruptions in the credit markets, which could
impact our customers’ ability to obtain financing for their businesses at reasonable prices, as well as impact their customers
when seeking financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their
respective businesses. In addition, our OEM customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their
dealers and customers. These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which
has suffered and may suffer additional disruptions should economic conditions deteriorate in the future. Our suppliers, as well
as the other suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not
available to our customers and suppliers, or if its cost is prohibitively high, their businesses would be negatively impacted,
which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization/liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such
negative impact, in turn, could materially and negatively affect us either through the loss of revenues to any of our customers
so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense resulting from disruptions in supply caused
by the suppliers so affected. Financial difficulties experienced by any major customer could have a material adverse impact on
us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide, materially reduced its capital expenditure on, and resulting
demand for, new product lines, or we otherwise experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer.

As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant
impairment charges or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date.

Furthermore, increased financial instability in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of Spanish and/or
global economic conditions could, among others:

    - make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our
debt in the future,

    - cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting
of any technical or other waivers under our debt facilities, to the extent we may seek them in the future, and

    - negatively impact global demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of our sales, operating income
and cash flows.

**_Continuing uncertainties and challenging geopolitical conditions in Spain, the European economy and the euro_**
**_could intensify the risks faced by the automotive industry and our business, which could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our operations, financial condition and profitability._**

Our results of operations are dependent on the economic and geopolitical conditions of markets in which we operate,
including Europe, North America, India and South America, some of which have experienced economic declines recently,
including in particular, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and during various periods in the past decade. Furthermore, our
business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending, which may be affected by negative
economic and political conditions. Economic contraction, heightened inflation, economic and political uncertainty and the
perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for the automotive
interior components that we offer. Rising interest rates negatively impact demand across the automotive industry by making it
more expensive to obtain vehicle financing, which may result in decreased demand for our vehicles and in turn decreased
demand for our services and products. In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could
be driven by factors such as an unstable job market or perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth. Economic
downturns and economic and political volatility in the various markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of
operations and financial condition.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Europe & ROW accounted for 52.1% and 52.8% of our combined Asia,
Europe & ROW and North America segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA, respectively. As a result,
adverse economic effects within Europe could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows. Continuing or renewed instability in the European markets, the fluctuation of the euro and the composition of
Europe have recently contributed to weak European economic performance. Future developments may continue to be
dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Central
Bank and the European Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the continued stability of the
Eurozone. Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries and their ability to meet future financial
obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and
political circumstances in individual member states of the Eurozone. These concerns could lead to the exit of one or more
countries from the Eurozone and the reintroduction of national currencies in the affected countries. The reintroduction of
national currencies in one or more countries that use the euro could lead to the disruption of financial markets and could have
a material adverse impact on our operations. Furthermore, any such redenomination event would likely be accompanied by
significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on
demand for our services and, accordingly, on our net turnover and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro
currencies within the countries in which we operate may impact our billing and other financial systems. In light of the significant
exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could
have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, there are several potential sources of economic uncertainty which could adversely affect the economy in
particular. First, the attacks in Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and the conflict that followed in the Gaza Strip has created
an unstable geopolitical environment in the Middle East. Further, the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation
on February 24, 2022, has resulted in certain sanctions being imposed by the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and
other jurisdictions (including the freezing of the assets related to the Russian government and individuals as well as the
exclusion of certain Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging system), all of which are expected to negatively
impact the global economy and financial markets. We cannot predict the impact of the rising conflict between Israel and Hamas,

which controls the Gaza Strip, or of Russian actions in Ukraine and any heightened military conflict or geopolitical instability
that may follow, including heightened operating risks and production disruptions in the Middle East, Russia and Europe,
additional sanctions or counter-sanctions, heightened inflation, market volatility, cyber disruptions or attacks, higher energy
costs, higher manufacturing costs, disruptions in raw materials supplies, increased raw material costs and higher supply chain
costs. Therefore, the imposition of sanctions on the Russian Federation, higher energy costs and commodity prices, cyber
disruptions or attacks, heightened general operating risks and disruption of logistic chains in Europe, may result in economic
instability, market volatility and heightened inflation, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial
condition and prospects. Further, heightened inflation and increased commodity prices may have a negative impact on
purchasing power and consumer spending, which could have an adverse effect on our business and cash flows. We discontinued
our Russian operations in 2022 by initiating a sale process of our entire business in this market, which was successfully
completed in March 2023. As a result, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have no assets or operations in Russia,
which was recognized as “discontinued operations” in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Moreover, the rising tensions between Russia on one hand and the United States, United Kingdom and Europe on the
other, particularly in relation to Russia’s actions in Ukraine and other geopolitical uncertainties (including escalating tensions
in certain regions of the world) as well as volatility in commodity prices or a negative market reaction to central bank policies,
may affect the growth of the Spanish economy and other countries in which we operate. Any of these factors could have a
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

**_We are dependent on large customers for current and future net turnover. The loss of any of these customers or_**
**_changes in the market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us._**

Although we supply our products to several of the leading automobile manufacturers, as is common in our industry,
we depend on certain large value customers for a significant proportion of our net turnover. For example, for the year ended
December 31, 2023, Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors—Jaguar Land Rover, represented
22.0%, 15.0%, 13.0%, 7.0% and 7.0% of our net turnover, respectively.

The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large volume customers could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing cash flows and by limiting our
ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger net turnover base. We may make fewer sales to these customers for a variety of
reasons, including, but not limited to:

    - loss of awarded business;

    - reduced or delayed customer requirements;

    - OEMs’ insourcing business they have traditionally outsourced to us;

    - strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by our customers;

    - bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer; or

    - reduced demand for our customers’ products.

See also “—We are susceptible to economic trends, and deterioration of economic conditions could adversely impact
_our business and exacerbate the difficulties experienced by our customers and suppliers in obtaining financing”._

Furthermore, our customers may consolidate or merge from time to time. For example, FCA and PSA merged into the
new Stellantis, and became world’s third largest automaker in terms of revenues when considering cars produced since its
inception in January, 2021. Consolidation among our customers could result in an increasingly concentrated client base of large
customers which could, among others, increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers and impact the terms
of the services that we provide. Mergers of our customers with entities that are not our customers could also materially impact
our financial position and results of operations. Any significant changes in the ownership or operation of our customers, as a
result of consolidation, merger or otherwise, could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of
operations.

**_Our inability to realize net turnover represented by our awarded business or termination or non-renewal of_**
**_production purchase orders by our customers could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition,_**
**_results of operations and cash flows._**

The realization of future net turnover from awarded business is inherently subject to a number of important risks and
uncertainties, including the number of vehicles that our customers will actually produce and the timing of that production.

Typically the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers do not include a commitment regarding
minimum volumes of purchases from us. In addition, such contracts typically provide that customers have the contractual right
to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them with no notice or limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our
customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct
out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for materials and work-in-progress and in certain instances undepreciated capital
expenditures and tooling. Further, there is no guarantee that our customers will renew their purchase orders with us. We cannot
assure you that our results of operations will not be materially adversely impacted in the future if we are unable to realize net
turnover from our awarded business, if our customers cancel awarded business or if our customers fail to renew their contracts
with us.

**_Disruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial_**
**_condition, results of operations and cash flows._**

The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to
maintain low inventory levels. In addition, our plants are typically located in close proximity to our customers.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain its spread and address its impact have had
significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to supply chains, workforce,
international travel, transactional activity, facility operations and production. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, both production volumes and sales were hit heavily due to severe measures imposed by governments that forced us to
temporarily close some of our production facilities and halt production in others. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material
adverse effect on the global automotive supply chain due to plant closures, reductions in demand for automobiles and other
factors. A resurgence or prolonged continuance of a public health crisis could have a material adverse effect, including
materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global, European or U.S. macroeconomic
outlooks. There are no comparable recent events in scale and duration that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot currently
estimate with any certainty, nor can we provide any assurance as to whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic will have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future.

Our supply chains are affected by both a global shortage of chips and semiconductors, and the increasing volatility of
certain raw materials. These changes have affected the way market participants operate in the auto industry, which historically
operated following a JIT model to properly optimize working capital management and reduce costs. For example, several
automakers and OEMs are investing in building up their inventories to anticipate potential supply disruptions in order to meet
their clients’ demand, while others are actively investing in new facilities to produce products that they used to source from
outside suppliers, in order to have full control of their supply chain. Due to limited semiconductor production in China and
Taiwan as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the secured industry experienced semiconductor shortages which decreased the
production volume and, consequently, adversely impacted our business. The current shortage of semiconductors may be further
exacerbated by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which has caused global supply chain disruptions and shortages in raw
materials used in semiconductor manufacturing such as neon and palladium. Any disruption due to semiconductor shortages
has impacted, and may continue to impact, the demand for our technologies and our production costs.

Disruptions could be caused by a multitude of potential problems, such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’
plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political
upheaval, as well as logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, other natural or nuclear disasters, pandemics,
mechanical failures, delayed customs processing and more. The global value chain has in the past experienced disruptions as
the result of a general lack of production capacity for certain raw materials or components.

Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all
of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse impact on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_The inability for us, our customers or our suppliers to obtain and maintain sufficient capital financing, including_**
**_working capital lines, and credit insurance may adversely affect our, our customers’ and our suppliers’ liquidity and_**
**_financial condition._**

Our working capital requirements can vary significantly, depending in part on the level, variability and timing of our
customers’ worldwide vehicle production and the payment terms with our customers and suppliers. Our liquidity could also be
adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on
delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required
to look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as potential
sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all.

There can be no assurance that we, our customers and our suppliers will continue to have such ability. This may
increase the risk that we cannot produce our products or will have to pay higher prices for our inputs. These higher prices may
not be recovered in our selling prices.

Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on the strength of the financial condition of our subsidiary
with the payment obligation, which may be less robust than our consolidated financial condition. If we were to experience
liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and in turn would likely not be able to offer us payment
terms that we have historically received. Our failure to receive such terms from our suppliers could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity.

**_We are subject to fluctuations in the prices of materials and commodities._**

Our operating income and net income can be adversely affected by changes in the prices of the materials we use,
notably textile fabrics, plastic injection grain, petroleum-based resins, certain metals, semiconductors and different
commodities. To the extent that our agreements with suppliers do not protect us from increases in the cost of materials or that
we cannot pass through increases in the costs of our materials to our customers, we are exposed to risks related to unfavorable
fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use derivatives to hedge our purchases of materials or energy. Recently,
commodity prices increased, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass on all such price increases to our customers.
Instead, in the Company’s estimate, we would likely absorb approximately 50% of any further commodity increases, which
could have an unfavorable impact on our sales, profitability, results and overall financial position.

**_We may have difficulty competing favorably in the highly competitive automotive parts industry generally and in_**
**_certain product or geographic areas specifically._**

The automotive parts industry is highly competitive and is heavily affected by technological developments and new
models shaping the future of the market (such as the new CASE+P trends), as cars are expected to become more connected,
autonomous, shared, electric and personalized over the next years. We face significant competition within each of our major
product areas, including from new competitors entering the markets that we serve, and OEMs that may seek to integrate
vertically. The principal competitive factors include price, technology, quality, global presence, service, product performance,
design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
continue to compete favorably in these competitive markets or that increased competition will not have a material adverse
effect on our business by reducing our ability to maintain sales and profit margins.

Furthermore, the failure to obtain new business projects on new models, the delay in certain projects caused by a
number of factors beyond our control (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and the failure to retain or increase business projects
on redesigned existing models could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In
addition, it may be difficult in the short-term for us to obtain new revenues to replace any unexpected decline in the sale of
existing products.

**_Shifts in market shares among vehicles or vehicle segments or shifts away from vehicles in which we have_**
**_significant content could have a material adverse effect on our profitability._**

While we supply internal components for a wide variety of vehicles produced globally, we do not supply components
for all vehicles produced, nor is the number or value of components evenly distributed among the vehicles for which we do
supply components. Shifts in market shares among vehicles or vehicle segments, particularly shifts away from vehicles on
which we have significant content and shifts away from vehicle segments in which our sales may be more heavily concentrated,
could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

33


-----

**_Our inability to offset price concessions or additional costs from our customers could have an adverse effect on_**
**_our profitability._**

We face ongoing pricing pressure, as well as pressure to absorb costs related to product design and engineering, as
well as other items previously paid for directly by OEMs, such as tooling. Typically, in line with our industry practice, our
customers benefit from price reductions during the life cycle of a contract. We expect to offset these price concessions by
achieving production efficiencies; however, we cannot guarantee that we will do so. If we fail to achieve production efficiencies
to fully offset price concessions or do not otherwise offset such price concessions, our profitability and results of operations
would be adversely affected.

**_We may be forced to downsize, close or sell some of our operations which could have an adverse effect on our_**
**_profitability._**

The automotive industry in some of our markets (most notably Western Europe) continues to experience significant
overcapacity, elevated levels of vehicle inventory, reduced consumer demand for vehicles and depressed production volumes
and sales levels. In response to these conditions, we may be forced to restructure our operations, including through plant
closures. If we are forced to close manufacturing locations because of loss of business or consolidation of manufacturing
facilities, the employee severance, asset retirement and other costs, including reimbursement costs relating to public subsidies,
to close these facilities may be significant. In certain locations that are subject to leases, we may continue to incur material
costs consistent with the initial lease terms. We continually attempt to align production capacity with demand; therefore, we
cannot assure you that additional plants will not have to be closed as part of the typical efficiency plans and cost-cutting
initiatives intended to adapt our operating structure and optimize our footprint to global trends and market needs.

**_The construction and maintenance of our facilities entails certain risks._**

The construction and maintenance of our facilities entails certain difficulties, both from a technical perspective as well
as in terms of the timing of the various construction phases. A number of problems may arise in relation to our facilities, such
as interruptions or delays due to failed deliveries by suppliers or manufacturers, problems with connecting to the utilities
networks, construction faults, problems linked to the operation of equipment, adverse weather conditions, unexpected delays
in obtaining or sourcing permits and authorizations, or longer-than-expected periods for technical adjustments. The additional
costs that may arise in the maintenance of facilities may adversely affect our business operations, financial position and
operational results.

**_Mechanical failure, equipment shutdowns and technological breakdown could adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to mechanical failure and equipment shutdowns which may be beyond our control, particularly the
failure of the airbags we incorporate into our cockpit modules. If a section of one of our production sites is damaged or shuts
down, it could cause a mechanical failure or equipment shutdown in other components of such production site. If such events
occur, our production capacity may be materially and adversely impacted. In the event that we are forced to shut down any of
our production sites for a significant period of time, it would have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial
position and operational results.

**_Interruptions in the supply of utilities to our facilities may negatively affect our operations._**

We are reliant upon a continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity, gas and water to our production facilities to
ensure the continued operation of our production lines and supply chain. An interruption to the supply of any of these utilities,
even in the short-term, including but not limited to a trip in the electricity grid, a gas leak or issues with local water mains,
could cause equipment shutdowns, mechanical failures and/or damage to our facilities and equipment which could materially
and adversely impact our business operations, financial position and operational results.

**_Our ongoing operations may require increased capital expenditure at certain stages that will consume cash from_**
**_our operations and borrowings._**

In order to maintain our product lines for existing products, from time to time, we are required to make certain
operational and maintenance related capital expenditure on our facilities. Our capital expenditures for the year ended
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to €253.0 million, €200.3 million and €217.2 million, respectively. Our ability
to undertake such operational and maintenance measures largely depends on our cash flow from our operations and access to
capital. We intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations. However, there may be unforeseen

34


-----

capital expenditure needs for which we may not have adequate capital. The timing of capital expenditures also may cause
fluctuations in our operational results.

**_Our profitability may be adversely affected by program launch difficulties._**

From time to time we are awarded new business by our customers. The launch of new programs is a complex process,
the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our and our suppliers’
manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial
product quality and other factors. Our failure to successfully launch material new programs could have an adverse effect on
our profitability.

**_We may not be able to grow our business with Asia-based automotive customers, or grow our business enough with_**
**_such customers to offset slower growth with our largest customers, which could have an adverse effect on our profitability._**

In light of the amount of business we currently have with our largest customers in certain regions, our opportunities
for incremental growth with these customers may be limited. While we have a substantial presence in Asia (especially in China
and South Korea), the amount of business we have with Asia-based OEMs, including Toyota, Hyundai, Kia and Honda,
generally lags that of our largest customers which are based in Europe (Ford, Volkswagen Group and Renault-Nissan) due in
part to the existing relationships between such Asia-based OEMs and their preferred suppliers. There is no certainty that we
can achieve growth with Asia-based OEMs, or that any such growth will offset slower growth we may experience with our
largest customers.

**_We may fail to achieve the targeted benefits from our strategic plan._**

We are committed to implementing our strategic plan for the 2023-2026 period, with a focus on rightsizing, footprint
optimization, industrial operational excellence and customer centricity. In connection therewith, we intend to continue
optimizing our footprint and rightsizing our business operations through productivity improvement resulting from advanced
manufacturing processes. In addition, we intend to also continue enhancing direct labor efficiency through automation, as well
as indirect labor efficiency through structural streamlining. Through the strategic plan, we aim to reduce our current footprint
by up to 15% and we expect to achieve additional liquidity of an estimated €150 million through selective asset sales, with
identified potential for additional gains by completing further divestments in our current pipeline. We also intend to further
optimize our footprint by continuing to increase our operations in low-cost countries in Eastern Europe and North America in
order to streamline our operations and reduce our cost base. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully
implement our strategic plan in a timely fashion or at all. The operational improvements targeted as part of our strategic plan
involve significant assumptions, including assumptions related to the realization of certain cost reductions, which are subject
to risks and uncertainties related to the implementation of the initiatives and business and operating performance. In developing
our financial targets relating to the strategic plan, we have made certain assumptions about the financial impact that the
aforementioned operational improvement measures will have on our future financial results. However, there can be no
assurance that these initiatives will yield the targeted benefits, or that they will not entail higher implementation costs than
expected or take longer to implement than expected. Our inability to implement our strategic plan as anticipated could have
materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial position and operational results.

**_Our order backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future sales or results of operations._**

One of the ways in which we measure our activity is through order backlog, which we define as forecast revenues
through new projects awarded to Antolin from our customers. As of December 31, 2023, our backlog between 2024 and 2027
was estimated to be approximately €17.0 billion, which represents approximately 85% of our component sales target for the
same period. Of our estimated €17.0 billion of backlog, we currently estimate that (i) between approximately 85% to 90% will
be within our Product Systems segment, with the remainder within our Technology Systems segment, and (ii) between
approximately 35% to 40% will be in North America, 15% to 20% will be in Asia and the remainder will be in Europe & ROW.

Backlog figures are based on a number of assumptions, including estimates of the percentage-of-completion of
contracts and foreign exchange fluctuations. Factors that could affect the realization of our backlog as future revenue include
cancellations, lower volumes than initially anticipated, scope of work adjustments, force majeure, legal impediments and
default by our customers. Although historically the extent of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material
compared to our total contract volume and is partially offset by cancellation penalties, customers can, and sometimes do,
terminate or modify their orders, resulting in a decrease of the previously reported order backlog. Such cancellations or
modifications can hence have a significant effect on the revenue we ultimately recognize from contracts. Backlog gives, at a

35


-----

given date, a picture of the estimated work remaining to complete under contracts in force. There is no guarantee future
execution of the backlog would generate the same levels of margin or cash flow as past execution. Backlog should therefore
not be used as an indication of future results of operations, and the non-realization of our backlog could materially and adversely
impact our business operations, financial position and operational results. See “Presentation of Financial Information and
_Other Data—Backlog” and “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**_We do not control certain of our joint ventures._**

We have a number of strategic partnerships and joint ventures and alliances. See “Business—Joint Ventures”. There
can be no assurance that the arrangements will be successful and/or achieve their planned objectives. The performance of all
such operations in which we do not have a controlling interest will depend on the financial and strategic support of the other
shareholders. Such other shareholders may make ill-informed or inadequate management decisions, or may fail to supply or be
unwilling to supply the required operational, strategic and financial resources, which could materially adversely affect these
operations. If any of our strategic partners were to encounter financial difficulties, change their business strategies or no longer
be willing to participate in these strategic partnerships, joint ventures and alliances, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Moreover, in some of these businesses, we may not have the power to control the payment of dividends or other
distributions, so even if the business is performing well, we may not be able to receive payment of our share of any profits.
Finally, there could be circumstances in which we may wish or be required to acquire the ownership interests of our partners,
and there can be no assurance that we will have access to the funds necessary to do so, on commercially reasonably terms or at
all.

**_The value of our deferred tax assets could become impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our_**
**_operating results._**

As of March 31, 2024, we had €173.7 million in deferred tax assets. The remaining deferred tax assets include net
operating loss carry forwards that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in
those future periods. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards may be limited and delayed. We periodically
determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to,
among others, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings. If we determine in the future that there is not
sufficient evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the factors described above or other factors, we may be
required to adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash
expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. In addition, adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several foreign
jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could
adversely affect our financial results. Finally, the Company and some of its Spanish subsidiaries and holding companies form a
tax group subject to the special tax consolidation regime for corporate income tax purposes. If, for whatever reason, the
consolidated tax regime were forfeited or the tax group extinguished, the right to offset the tax loss carry forwards and use the
tax credits of the tax group would be assigned to the companies that generated them. This could limit the ability of the
companies to effectively make use of these deferred tax assets and that could adversely affect our financial results.

**_Our profitability may be materially adversely affected by our inability to utilize tax losses or because of tax_**
**_exposures we face._**

We have incurred losses in some countries which we may not be able to fully or partially offset against income we
have earned in those countries. In some cases, we may not be able to utilize these losses at all if we cannot generate profits in
those countries or if we have ceased conducting business in those countries altogether. Our inability to utilize material tax
losses could materially adversely affect our profitability. At any given time, we may face other tax exposures arising out of
changes in tax laws, tax reassessments or otherwise. To the extent we cannot implement measures to offset these exposures,
they may have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

**_Changes in our mix of earnings between jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates could_**
**_have a material adverse effect on our profitability._**

Our effective tax rate varies in each country in which we conduct business. Changes in our mix of earnings between
jurisdictions with lower tax rates and those with higher tax rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.

36

**_We are subject to taxation which is complex and often requires us to make subjective determinations._**

We are subject to many different forms of taxation in multiple jurisdictions including but not limited to income taxes,
value added taxes, social security and other payroll related taxes. Tax law and administration in each of these jurisdictions is
complex and often requires us to make subjective determinations. The various tax authorities may not agree with the
determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law. Such disagreements could result in lengthy legal
disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial amounts of tax, interest and penalties. Additionally, we could be
adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations in various jurisdictions. Such adverse effects could
apply to our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments and/or the increase in our costs to track and collect
such taxes. The occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_We have a material amount of goodwill, which, if impaired, would result in a reduction in our net income and_**
**_equity._**

Goodwill is primarily derived from our acquisition of the interior business of Magna International Inc. and its
subsidiaries in 2015, as well as the acquisition of CML Innovative Technologies in 2011, and represents the excess of the cost
of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. IFRS requires that goodwill be periodically evaluated for
impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit. Declines in our profitability or the value of comparable companies
may impact the fair value of our reporting units, which could result in a write-down of goodwill and a reduction in net income.
As of March 31, 2024, we had €90.8 million of goodwill on our consolidated statement of financial position that could be
subject to impairment. Any new businesses acquired in the future could result in recognition of additional goodwill, which
could be significant. We could also be required to recognize additional impairments in the future and such an impairment
charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period of recognition.

**_We are subject to risks related to our international operations._**

We have a geographically diversified platform of 118 manufacturing plants and JIT assembly and sequencing
facilities, as well as 26 technical-commercial offices, or TCOs, in 25 countries worldwide as of December 31, 2023.
International operations are subject to various risks that could have a material adverse effect on those operations and our
business as a whole, including but not limited to:

    - exposure to local economic and social conditions, including logistical and communication challenges;

    - exposure to local political conditions, including political disputes, coups, the risk of seizure of assets by a foreign
government, increased risk of fraud and political corruption, terrorism, acts of war or similar events;

    - exposure to local public health issues and the resultant impact on economic and political conditions;

    - exposure to potentially undeveloped legal systems which make it difficult to enforce contractual rights and to
potentially adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices;

    - exposure to local tax requirements, obligations and other regulations;

    - foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls;

    - greater risk of uncontrollable accounts and longer collection cycles;

    - the risk of government sponsored competition;

    - controls on the repatriation of cash, including the imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on
remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries; and

    - export and import restrictions.

**_We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanction_**
**_programs._**

Our international operations require us to comply with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions. In particular,
our international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the
UN, EU and Office of Foreign Asset Control in the United States. These laws prohibit improper business conduct and restrict
us from dealing with certain sanctioned countries.

As a result of our international operations we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions
regulations applicable in those countries where we operate. Some of the countries in which we operate lack as developed a
legal system as other locations and are perceived to have high levels of corruption. Our continued geographical diversification,
including in emerging economies, development of joint venture relationships worldwide and our employment of local agents
in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or similar laws. Violations
of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges,
injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and revocations or
restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, any major violations could have a significant
impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business.

We have a Compliance Management System, which includes policies and procedures designed to ensure our
compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This system encompasses training our employees in multiple related subjects
such as the Code of Ethics, anti-harassment, anti-bribery, antitrust, conflict of interest, data protection, information security,
international trade, and respectful communications.

Our Code of Conduct, updated in 2023 and translated into all the languages in which our Group operates, aims to
educate our employees on these policies and principles. In order to continuously reinforce our Corporate Governance Model,
we established a Compliance Direction in 2017, which serves to assist in promoting and developing a global compliance culture
within the core of our organization and to define a regulatory compliance system as a guarantee for the effective support of
integrity within the organization.

While we have a strong compliance culture and believe we have adequate control systems in place, we have globally
implemented SAP-GRC (Risk and Controls Management Module) to ensure that compliance risks are identified, analyzed, and
assessed. Since 2020, we have also implemented a comprehensive compliance management system, which integrates various
key aspects, including criminal compliance and anti-bribery, and has been certified with the requirements of reference standards
UNE 19601, ISO/UNE 37001, and the recently acquired global compliance standard ISO 37301.

We seek to continuously improve our system of internal controls to remedy any weaknesses identified through
appropriate corrective actions, depending on the circumstances. These actions may include additional training, enhancement
of employees' quality of life, and other relevant measures.

Ensuring the privacy and protection of data is also a core component of our Compliance Management System. We are
committed to safeguarding the personal and sensitive information of our employees, clients, and stakeholders. To this end, we
have appointed a Data Protection Officer in 2023, who is responsible for overseeing our data protection strategy and its
implementation to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and maintenance BCRs. Our data protection policies are
designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant
data protection laws in the jurisdictions where we operate. We implement robust data security measures, including encryption,
access controls, and regular audits, to protect against data breaches and unauthorized access. Our commitment to compliance,
privacy, and data protection is reflected in our comprehensive management systems and continuous improvement efforts. By
fostering a culture of integrity and accountability, we strive to maintain the highest standards of corporate governance and
ethical conduct throughout our organization.

**_Foreign exchange rate fluctuations could cause a decline in our financial condition, results of operations and cash_**
**_flows, and our hedging and other derivative arrangements may not effectively or sufficiently offset the negative impact of_**
**_foreign exchange rate fluctuations._**

Although our reporting currency is the euro, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies,
such as the U.S. dollar, the UK pound the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee, the Mexican peso, the Czech
crown and the Hungarian forint. Such non-euro currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the

38


-----

operations. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the consolidated income statement
as and when they occur.

We are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we
generate revenues because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country. The financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of some of our operating entities are reported in foreign currencies and then translated into euro at
the applicable foreign exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the euro
against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported sales and profits while depreciation of
the euro against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits.

Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values
of the non-euro currencies in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition and
any sustained change in such relative currency values could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic regions.
For example, the foreign exchange impact represented €67.4 million (or €138.8 million to give effect to the dollarization of our
Mexican business) of decreased net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023 (on a “like for like” basis compared to the
year ended December 31, 2022) and €11.3 million (or €22.3 million to give effect to the dollarization of our Mexican business)
of decreased net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 (on
a “like for like” basis).

Economic instability in the countries in which we operate where the euro is not the local currency and the related
decline in the value of the relevant local currency in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Although we, at Grupo Antolin, have not entered into any foreign-currency hedge rate agreements or forward
contracts, we seek a variety of mechanisms to hedge against major movements in currencies, such as using local suppliers and
negotiating with customers and suppliers. We may also use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial
derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may
not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from foreign currency variations. Gains or losses
associated with hedging activities may also negatively impact operating results.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, an additional 5% rise in the euro against currencies such as the Czech crown,
the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso, the UK pound and the Chinese renminbi would have reduced our net
turnover by approximately €128 million.

**_There are integration and consolidation risks associated with potential future acquisitions and divestitures. Future_**
**_acquisitions and divestments may result in significant transaction expenses, unexpected liabilities and a negative impact on_**
**_operations and/or cash flows. Future acquisitions may result in risks associated with entering new markets, and we may be_**
**_unable to profitably operate any new businesses acquired._**

We have made or entered into, and as part of our business strategy may continue to pursue (in line with our overall
growth and business strategy), various acquisitions, business combinations and joint ventures intended to complement or
expand our business, such as our acquisition of 44% of the share capital of the Chinese company Shanghai Antolin-Naen
Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd. in May 2023, pursuant to which we gained control of 95% of this entity. Given that
discussions or activities relating to potential acquisitions range from private negotiations to participation in open bid processes,
the timing of any such acquisition is uncertain. Although we actively and regularly engage in discussions and activities with
respect to possible acquisitions and investments, we currently have no present agreements or understandings to enter into any
such material transaction. Any indebtedness incurred or assumed in connection with an acquisition may or may not increase
our leverage relative to our Management EBITDA or to our equity capitalization. In addition, we may encounter difficulties
integrating acquired assets into our existing operations.

We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in the future, or may not be able to finance such
acquisitions on favorable terms. We may lack sufficient management, financial and other resources to successfully integrate
future acquisitions or to ensure that such future acquisitions will perform as planned or prove to be beneficial to our operations.
We may not be offered suitable terms, including price, for divestitures we wish to make. In addition, we may not realize the
expected benefits at the time we enter into agreements for this type of transaction. Acquisitions and divestitures in general
involve numerous other risks, including the diversion of our management’s attention from other business concerns, undisclosed
risks impacting the target and potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with current customers and suppliers.

39


-----

In addition, any acquisitions or divestitures could impact our financial position or cash flow. In certain transactions,
our acquisition analysis includes assumptions regarding the consolidation of operations and improved operating cost structures
for the combined operations. Such synergies or benefits may not be achieved on the assumed time schedule or in the assumed
amount, if at all. Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses, unexpected liabilities and risks
associated with entering new markets in addition to the integration and consolidation risks. As a result of our acquisitions or
divestments, we may assume continuing obligations, deferred payments and liabilities. Any past or future acquisitions may
result in exposure to third parties for liabilities, such as liability for faulty work done by the acquired business and liability of
the acquired business or assets that may or may not be adequately covered by insurance or by indemnification, if any, from the
former owners of the acquired business or assets. In connection with divestitures, we may remain exposed to the buyer for tax,
environmental or other liabilities of the divested business. The occurrence of any of these liabilities could have a material
adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

**_We have invested substantial resources in markets where we expect growth and we may be unable to timely alter_**
**_our strategies should such expectations not be realized._**

Our future growth is dependent on our making the right investments at the right time to support product development
and manufacturing capacity in areas where we can support our customer base. We have identified certain markets including
North America and Asia as key markets where we are likely to experience substantial growth, and accordingly have made and
expect to continue to make substantial investments, both directly and through participation in various partnerships and joint
ventures to support anticipated growth in those regions. If we are unable to deepen existing and develop additional customer
demand in these regions, we may not only fail to realize expected rates of return on our existing investments, but we may incur
losses on such investments and be unable to timely redeploy the invested capital to take advantage of other markets, potentially
resulting in lost market share to our competitors. Our results will also suffer if these regions do not grow as quickly as we
anticipate.

**_Loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact_**
**_our operations._**

Our success is impacted by the activities and expertise of the members of our management. The loss of one or more
members of our senior management, board of directors or management committee members could impair our ability to manage
our operations effectively, particularly if we fail to attract new highly qualified management executives or qualified employees
in key positions. We also face competition for highly qualified employees from competing automotive and other companies,
and may not be able to recruit, retain or replace key employees in a timely fashion or at all. If we are unable to retain or replace
the key members of our team, this could result in a significant loss of expertise and could have material adverse effects on our
business, assets and liabilities, as well as on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_Availability of labor in some of the areas in which we operate could negatively impact our operations._**

When establishing and operating facilities in some emerging economies, we may encounter difficulties with the
availability of labor. In some instances we may compete with our customers for qualified employees in a limited labor pool of
adequately trained workers. Performing work in these areas and under these circumstances can slow our progress, potentially
causing us to incur contractual liabilities to our customers. These circumstances may also cause us to incur additional,
unanticipated costs that we might not be able to pass on to our customers.

**_Our profitability could be negatively impacted if we are not able to maintain appropriate utilization of our_**
**_workforce._**

The extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. If we under utilize our workforce, our project
profits and overall profitability suffer in the short-term. If we over utilize our workforce, we may negatively impact safety,
employee satisfaction and project execution, which could result in a decline of future project awards. The utilization of our
workforce is impacted by numerous factors including:

    - our estimate of the headcount requirements for various manufacturing units based upon our forecast of the demand
for our products;

    - our ability to maintain our talent base and manage attrition;

40


-----

    - our ability to schedule our portfolio of projects to efficiently utilize our employees and minimize production
downtime;

    - our need to invest time and resources into functions such as training, business development, employee recruiting,
and sales that are not chargeable to customer projects; and

    - the degree of structural flexibility of labor laws in countries where our employees are located.

**_The workforce in the automotive industry is highly unionized, and if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective_**
**_bargaining agreements with our labor unions as they expire from time to time, or if our employees, or our customers’_**
**_employees, engage in work stoppages and other labor problems, this could result in a material adverse effect._**

We have a large number of collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we have specific exposure to labor strikes
in our international operations driven by our employees and/or our customers’ employees. For example, as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum, our plants in Shelby and in Missouri were unionized, and we are monitoring the unionization of our
plants in Howell and Marlette. If major work disruptions involving our employees were to occur, our business could be
adversely affected by a variety of factors, including a loss of revenues, increased costs and reduced profitability. We cannot
assure you that we will not experience a material labor disruption at one or more of our facilities in the future whether in the
course of renegotiation of our labor arrangements or otherwise. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully extend
or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time. If we fail to extend or renegotiate any of
our collective bargaining agreements or are only able to renegotiate them on terms that are less favorable to us, we may need
to incur additional costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Further, many of the manufacturing facilities of our customers and suppliers are unionized and are subject to the
risk of labor disruptions from time to time. A significant labor disruption could lead to a lengthy shutdown of our customers’
or our suppliers’ production lines, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.

**_A shift away from technologies in which we invest and the rise of technology that creates competition for our_**
**_products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition._**

Our business requires a high level of technical expertise for the development and manufacture of our products. We
invest in technology and innovation which we believe will be critical to our long-term growth and we need to continually adapt
our expertise in response to technological innovations, industry standards, product instructions and customer requirements. Our
ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products or
manufacturing processes on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. New technologies
or changes in industry and customer requirements, such as the increasing trends towards hybrid and electric vehicles and the
development of systems learning on artificial intelligence in connection with design activities, product and process engineering
and software development, any of which may render one or more of our current offerings obsolete, excessively costly or
otherwise unmarketable. If there is a shift away from the use of technologies in which we are investing, our costs may not be
fully recovered. We may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if other technologies emerge as industry leading technologies,
which could have a material adverse effect on our prospects for growth, profitability and financial condition.

**_Legal or regulatory claims or investigations against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial_**
**_position._**

From time to time, we may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings, claims or investigations, including
by governmental bodies, customers, suppliers, former employees, class action plaintiffs and others which are incidental to the
conduct of our business. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to
these proceedings or claims, although it is difficult to predict final outcomes with any degree of certainty. See “Business—
_Proceedings”. We are also subject to tax audits from time to time. Among other tax audits, the Mexican tax authorities are_
currently conducting a tax audit of our corporate income tax for the year ended December 31, 2017 in connection with our
Mexican business, German tax authorities are currently conducting general tax audits for the years ended December 31, 2016
through to 2021 in connection with our German business, and Slovakian tax authorities are currently conducting a tax audit of
our corporate income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019 in connection with our Slovakian business.

Except as disclosed in this Offering Memorandum, we do not believe that any of the proceedings or claims to which
we are currently a party will result in costs, charges or liabilities that will have a material adverse effect on our financial
position. However, we cannot assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material,
or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial

41


-----

statements. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are
resolved unfavorably to us.

**_We face risks related to the intellectual and industrial property we use._**

We believe that we either own or may validly use all the intellectual and industrial property rights required for our
business operations and that we have taken all reasonable measures to protect our rights or obtain warranties from the owners
of third-party rights. However, we cannot rule out the risk that our intellectual and industrial property rights may be disputed
by a third party on the grounds of pre-existing rights or for any other reason. Furthermore, for countries outside Europe and
North America, we cannot be sure of holding or obtaining intellectual and industrial property rights offering the same level of
protection as those in Europe and North America.

**_Product liability claims, warranty and recall costs could cause us to incur losses and damage our reputation._**

We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event of the failure of our products to
perform to specifications, or if our products are alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury or death. We are generally
required under our customer contracts to indemnify our customers for product liability claims in respect of our products.
Accordingly, we may be materially and adversely impacted by product liability claims.

If any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving those
products. In addition, our customers demand that we bear the cost of the repair and replacement of defective products which
are either covered under their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them. Warranty provisions are established based on our
best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect issues. Recall costs are costs
incurred when government regulators or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or suspected performance
issue and we are required to participate either voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer agreements, we only
account for existing or probable warranty claims. We have no warranty and recall data which allows us to establish accurate
estimates of, or provisions for, future warranty or recall costs relating to new products, assembly programs or technologies
being brought into production. In addition, our insurance covering product recalls is limited in amount and coverage and in
some jurisdictions non-existent. The obligation to repair or replace such products could have a material adverse effect on our
profitability and financial condition.

A decrease in actual and perceived quality of our products could damage our image and reputation and also the image
and reputation of one or more of our brands. Defective products could result in loss of sales, loss of customers and loss of
market acceptance. In turn, any major defect in one of our products could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation
and market perception, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our sales and results of operations.

**_Our operations expose us to the risk of material health and safety liabilities._**

The nature of our operations subjects us to various statutory compliance and litigation risks under health, safety and
employment laws. We cannot guarantee that there will be no accidents or incidents suffered by our employees, our contractors
or other third parties on our sites. If any of these incidents occur, we could be subject to prosecutions and litigation, which may
lead to fines, penalties and other damages being imposed on us and cause damage to our reputation. Such events could have a
material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and operational results.

**_We are subject to environmental requirements and risks as a result of which we may incur significant costs,_**
**_liabilities and obligations._**

We are subject to a variety of environmental and pollution control laws, regulations and permits that govern, among
others, soil, surface water and groundwater contamination; the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and transportation
of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of materials, including greenhouse gases, into the environment; and health
and safety. If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators
or become subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations and permits, and the enforcement thereof,
change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or
operating costs.

We are also subject to environmental laws requiring investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination.
Estimating environmental clean-up liabilities is complex and heavily dependent on the nature and extent of historical
information and physical data relating to the contaminated sites, the complexity of the contamination, the uncertainty of which

42


-----

remedy to apply and the outcome of discussions with regulatory authorities relating to the contamination. In addition, these
environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent and expensive
over time. Therefore, in the future, we may not be in complete compliance with all such laws and regulations and we may incur
material costs or liabilities as a result of such laws and regulations. In addition to potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third party claims for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury or
property damage.

For example, Trimtec Ltda. (“Trimtec”), our Brazilian subsidiary, is subject to, together with 49 other companies, an
environmental claim initiated in 2009 in connection with alleged environmental damages caused by Companhia Brasileira de
Bauxita (“CBB”). CBB was hired to provide services of incineration and industrial waste disposal for Trimtec and other
companies in 2001. CBB did not perform such services and failed to dispose of the waste adequately, which allegedly led to
causing the litigious environmental damage. A first independent expert in the assessment and valuation of environmental
damages was appointed in connection with the proceedings and has issued an expert’s report which was only submitted to the
public prosecutor. Upon examination of the independent expert’s report, the public prosecutor proposed terms of adjustment
of conduct, to which Trimtec adhered. As a result, and following the identification of the environmental damages, a further
independent expert was appointed in order to assess the scope of the remedial works to be undertaken in order to remedy the
environmental damages caused by CBB. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, this independent expert has accessed
the area impacted by the environmental in order to appraise the scope thereof and, as a result, these proceedings remain ongoing.
See “Business—Proceedings”.

We cannot assure you that our costs, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters will not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may not be adequately insured._**

We currently have insurance arrangements in place for products and public liability, property damage, business
interruption (including for sudden and unexpected environmental damage), cyber damages and directors and officers liability.
However, these insurance policies may not cover any losses or damages resulting from the materialization of any of the risks
we are subject to. Further, significant increases in insurance premiums could reduce our cash flow. It is also possible in the
future that insurance providers may no longer wish to insure businesses in our industry against certain environmental
occurrences.

**_We may face cybersecurity risks related to our electronic system business unit_**

Our IT systems form an integral part of the functionality of our business as they ensure the security of the data that
supports many of our products and services. Our IT systems and our electronic system business are subject to the risk of
computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, or cyberattacks from a variety of sources, including directly,
through a vendor, customer, or other business partner with access to our IT systems, or through code embedded in a program
or application we run on our IT systems. In particular, an increased number of cyberattacks continues to put a focus on
information security and the protection of personal data.

For us to mitigate any potential damages arising from such exposure, we have contracted a cyber-risk policy and
enacted a series of guidelines and strategies in connection with internal cyber risk prevention within the Company. However,
we cannot guarantee that the additional hired insurance and the mitigating policies and strategies will cover and/or prevent any
and/or all losses or damage resulting from the materialization of any of the cybersecurity risks we are subject to. Our preventive
measures to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT environment may be insufficient and we may experience
break-ins, cyberattacks, or other security breaches to our systems. A successful cyberattack would have significant adverse
effects on our business activities as it would disrupt our business operations and also affect our internal and external
communication. Any such attack may further expose us to risks relating to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data
and may lead to severe damage to our reputation and image. Due to the nature of evolving IT systems and cyber security
landscape in light of the diverse and increasingly complex breaches, we cannot predict the method or outcome of every potential
cyber incident. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.

**_Significant changes in laws and governmental regulations could have an adverse effect on our profitability._**

The legal, regulatory and industry standard environment in our principal markets is complex and dynamic, and future
changes to the laws, regulations and market practice as regards, for example, carbon dioxide emissions and safety tests and

43


-----

protocols, could have an adverse effect on the products we produce and our profitability. Additionally, we could be adversely
affected by changes in tax or other laws and jurisprudence which impose additional costs on automobile manufacturers or
consumers, or more stringent fuel economy and emissions requirements on manufacturers and our OEM customers could
negatively impact their levels and production and, therefore, materially affect their demand for our products our sales. For
example, changes to carbon dioxide emissions testing protocols, as a result of the ongoing investigations by environmental
authorities worldwide in relation to the potential manipulation of carbon dioxide emissions control systems which had been
installed by certain OEMs for the purposes of manipulating laboratory carbon dioxide emissions testing, could have an adverse
effect on the sales of the products we produce and our profitability.

**_We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business._**

Greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state
and local attention. Greenhouse gas emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we
operate, and additional greenhouse gas requirements are in various stages of development. For example, the United States
Congress has considered legislation that would establish a nationwide limit on greenhouse gases. In addition, the EPA has
issued regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from mobile and stationary sources pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act.
Becoming effective, such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution
control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs. New measures could require us to modify existing or
obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs. In
addition, our OEM customers may seek price reductions from us to account for their increased costs resulting from greenhouse
gas regulations. Further, growing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources could reduce automobile
sales, thereby reducing demand for our products and ultimately our revenues. Thus, any additional regulation of greenhouse
gas emissions, including through a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other
program, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation, product demand and
liquidity.

**_Changes in accounting standards may materially impact reporting of our financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Accounting principles as per the IFRS and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and
interpretations for many aspects of our business are complex and involved subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their
interpretation may significantly change or add significant volatility to our reported income or loss without a comparable
underlying change in cash flows from operations. As a result, changes in accounting standards may materially impact our
reported financial condition and results of operations.

**_Interruptions in operations at our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations._**

We operate over 118 manufacturing plants and JIT assembly and sequencing facilities, as well as 26 TCOs in 25
countries worldwide as of December 31, 2023.

Our results of operations are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities and the ability to supply
products to our customers. Our production processes are complex as they need to be adapted to variations in the properties of
certain materials and use combustibles and other dangerous materials. Significant interruptions in operations at our production
plants or the plants of suppliers we use, such as due to theft, explosions, fires or any other accidents or acts of God including
pandemics, natural disasters, floods, hurricanes and earthquakes may significantly reduce the productivity and profitability of
a particular production facility, or our business as a whole, during and after such interruptions. Although we hold several types
of insurance policies (including insurance against fire and business interruptions), our insurance coverage may be inadequate.
Furthermore, our insurance coverage may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms and our insurance
carriers may not have sufficient funds to cover all losses, damages, liabilities or potential claims. Interruptions in operations at
our facilities could disrupt our supply of products to our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We have been exposed to such incidents in the past. For example, on January 29, 2022, we suffered a fire at JIT site
of Grupo Antolin Turnov, s.r.o. in Mlada Boleslav (Czech Republic). The fire resulted in extensive property damage and
increased working costs incurred by other subsidiaries. While the costs associated to this incident were covered by our
insurance, we cannot assure you that insurance will cover the costs of similar incidents in the future.

**_Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war or political changes in geographical areas where we operate_**
**_may affect our business and results of operations._**

Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect our business and results of operations. There
can be no assurance that there will not be terrorist attacks or violent acts that may directly impact us, our customers or partners.
In addition, political changes in certain geographical areas where we operate may affect our business and results of operations.
Any of these occurrences could cause a significant disruption in our business and could adversely affect our business operations,
financial position and operational results.

**_We may be subject to restrictions on transfer of funds._**

Under the current foreign exchange regulations in certain countries in which we operate, there are restrictions on the
transfer of funds into and outside of such countries, which may include restrictions on the disposition of funds deposited with
banks and restrictions on transferring funds abroad, as well as require official approval to buy foreign currency. Additionally,
we have trapped cash in certain jurisdictions in which we operate in relation to our joint ventures and local law. These
restrictions could impact the payment of dividends to us by certain of our subsidiaries. If we were unable to repatriate funds
from any such countries, we would not be able to use the cash flow from our businesses to finance our operating requirements
elsewhere and satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**Risks Related to the Notes**

**_Not all of the Guarantees will initially guarantee the Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Notes will only be guaranteed by the Issue Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the
Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility. The Notes
will be guaranteed by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the
Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, within 120 days from the Issue Date (subject
to the satisfaction of applicable local law formalities, including with regard to transfer pricing rules).

The Guarantee to be provided by Grupo Antolin South Africa (PTY) Ltd within 120 days from the Issue Date requires
the approval of the Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (“FinSurv”). After the Issue Date, it is
anticipated that Grupo Antolin South Africa (PTY) Ltd will lodge an application with FinSurv for approval to provide its
Guarantee, which application may take up to six weeks to be processed by FinSurv. To the extent FinSurv provides approval
for Grupo Antolin South Africa (PTY) Ltd to provide its Guarantee, such guarantee would typically be conditioned upon any
claims under the Guarantee not exceeding the net asset value of Grupo Antolin South Africa (PTY) Ltd. There can be no
assurance that our application with FinSurv will be approved within 120 days from the Issue Date or at all, and such approval
may be granted on conditions that reduce the value of the Guarantee or otherwise make the granting thereof impracticable.

We will agree in the Indenture to take such necessary actions so that the Post-Closing Date Guarantors become
guarantors of the Notes by executing and delivering to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the form attached
to the Indenture. The Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described in “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and
_Insolvency Regime.”_

**_The Collateral is limited to a pledge of shares in the Company and the Notes are secured only to the extent of the_**
**_value of the Collateral; such security may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations under the Notes and the Guarantees._**

Within 120 days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Collateral. Notwithstanding the fact that the
Notes will be secured by a pledge numerically successive to the pledges securing the existing senior secured debt, pursuant to
the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received upon enforcement of the Collateral will be applied pro rata in repayment of
liabilities in respect of the Notes, the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility. Subject
to certain limits, the Indenture will permit additional debt to be secured by the Collateral, and such additional secured debt may
be substantial. The rights of a holder of Notes to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the
Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. If there is an Event of Default (as defined in the Indenture) on
the Notes, there is no guarantee that the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy, and may be
substantially less than, amounts due under the Notes as well as other debt benefiting from a pari passu security interest in the
Collateral, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility. The amount of
proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend
upon many factors, including, among others, the availability of buyers. Furthermore, there may not be any buyer willing and

45


-----

able to purchase our business as a whole. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable
value for such assets.

**_HoldCo has control over the Collateral securing the Notes and the sale of particular assets could reduce the pool_**
**_of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will allow HoldCo, as pledgor, to remain in possession of, retain exclusive control over, and
collect and invest any dividends and other distributions from the Collateral. In certain limited circumstances, HoldCo may,
subject to the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, without any release or consent by the Security Agent,
dispose of the Collateral (which shall remain subject to the pledge in respect thereto notwithstanding any such disposal).

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

By its nature, the Collateral does not have a readily ascertainable market value and may not be saleable or, if it is
saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement provide that decisions
regarding enforcement are made by the holders of the Notes, holders of the 2028 Notes and lenders holding, collectively, a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. As a result, holders of the Notes may not
solely control decisions in respect to the Collateral, including timing of enforcement and such other secured parties may have
interests that are not the same as those of holders of the Notes. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted
to other parties encumber assets owned by the Company, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect
to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and
the ability of the Security Agent, acting on behalf of the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that
Collateral. In the event of enforcement of the pledge over the Collateral, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for a release of
all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors. As a result, if the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to
repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the
Collateral) would have no remaining claim against the Company or any Guarantor. Creditors of the Company or its subsidiaries
not secured by a lien on the Collateral will not be obligated to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, in the event
of an enforcement action, such creditors will not be obligated to release their claims against the Company and/or its subsidiaries.
Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the Intercreditor Agreement could reduce the
attractiveness of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral.

The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to any and all encumbrances, liens and other imperfections permitted
under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or
foreclose on such Collateral.

**_The security interests in the Collateral are not directly granted to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure, among other obligations, the obligations of the Company are not
granted directly to the holders of the Notes but are granted only in favor of the Security Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes in accordance with the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents. Holders of the
Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Notes, except through the Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

**_The granting of guarantees and security interests in the Collateral by Spanish companies is restricted by Spanish_**
**_law._**

Spanish law imposes a restriction on the granting of guarantees by Spanish guarantors under Spanish law-governed
Security Documents such that guarantees in respect of obligations under such Security Documents shall not include nor extend
to any obligations or amounts that would render such guarantees in contravention of sections 143.2 (with respect to Spanish
private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), and 149 or 150 (with respect to Spanish public limited
companies (sociedades anónimas), in each case, of the Spanish Capital Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 2
_de julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital)._

In particular, the Spanish Capital Companies Act prohibits financial assistance: (i) with respect to Spanish public
limited companies (sociedades anónimas), in relation to the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of any direct or indirect
parent company, and (ii) with respect to Spanish private limited companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), in

46


-----

relation to the acquisition of their own shares and the shares of any member of their corporate group. Therefore, any guarantee
or security interest granted by any company incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation
incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish guarantor or the shares of its parent company or
the shares of any member of their corporate group, as applicable, to the extent that such security interest would constitute
unlawful financial assistance. Furthermore, any guarantee or security granted by any Spanish company shall not apply to the
extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes
described above.

The interpretations of the laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of the Guarantors organized in Spain to
guarantee the Notes or the ability of HoldCo to grant security on the Collateral. Although the law does not establish any limit,
recent Spanish case law indicates, and certain scholars understand that, risks associated with a guarantee or the value of a
security interest provided by a Spanish company to secure the indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group
shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s own perspective and justified
under the corporate interest of such guarantor or grantor and all this must be evidenced to the judge.

Furthermore, the interpretations of the laws of Spain of certain scholars about the specialty principle (principio de
_especialidad), conclude that a security interest can only secure one primary obligation, together with its ancillary obligations._
Therefore, when there are multiple primary obligations with respect to different creditors, such as the secured creditors under
Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility and the holders of the Notes, there must be at least one security interest for each
primary obligation to be secured. Additionally, although multiple mortgages over the same asset securing different obligations
are recognized, Spanish law does not expressly recognize the existence of two or more pledges over the same asset. However,
the existence of two or more pledges over the same shares has become a market practice in Spain and is accepted by the majority
of legal scholars although no case law has supported the enforceability of such pledges and it cannot be disregarded that a court
could take a different view and consider such pledges inefficient and not admissible in Spain.

**_Under Spanish law the enforcement of the Guarantees and the Collateral granted by any Spanish obligor may be_**
**_restricted._**

_Insolvency law_

The Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 approving the consolidated text of the Insolvency Law (Real Decreto Legislativo
_1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal), as amended (“Spanish Insolvency Law”)_
imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditors’ rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency of the debtor
(though does not apply to financial collateral considered as such under Royal Decree 5/2005, dated March 11, as amended from
time to time (the "RDL 5/2005")).

Enforcements of in rem securities can be suspended if the debtor (owner of the security) initiates the so called preinsolvency communication before the applicable Court, informing that it has initiated negotiation with its creditors to reach a
restructuring plan in accordance with Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law
(the “Opening of Negotiations communication”). Such enforcements can be initiated but are suspended for a three month
period (potentially extendable three additional months) as from the Opening of Negotiations Communication if the _in rem_
security befalls assets or rights required for the continuity of the professional or business activities. On the contrary,
enforcement of public law claims or labor claims are not affected by the Opening of Negotiations Communication.

Enforcement is also stayed in case a restructuring plan is submitted for homologation and it is admitted by the court,
until the time the court decides to homologate it or not. If the restructuring plan affects the credit rights secured by the in-rem
collateral, the homologation of the plan allows to impose such measures to the secured credit rights of the creditor even in case
such creditor has not adhered to the restructuring plan (i.e., if it is a dissenting creditor), provided that the requirements for the
homologation of a restructuring plan are fulfilled (i.e., approval by the relevant majorities of the classes of claims, among
others) without prejudice of the creditor’s right to challenge the homologation. According to article 651.1 of the Spanish
Insolvency Law, creditors holding security rights that have voted against the plan and belong to a class in which the favorable
vote was lower than the dissenting vote, will have the right to request the realization of the encumbered assets or rights within
one month from the publication of the approval order in the public insolvency registry. However, the proceeding for the
enforcement of the security shall be conducted before the competent court and shall be subject to the time limits and
requirements of the corresponding enforcement proceeding.

Once the debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of security interests over assets owned by the debtor and used
for its professional or business activities is stayed until the first of the following circumstances occurs: (a) an arrangement of a

47


-----

composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition agreement does not affect such right; or (b) one year has
elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings being initiated. Enforcement will be stayed even if
at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be
lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the assets are not necessary for the survival of the
debtor’s professional or business activities.

When it comes to determining which assets of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts
have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets. Nevertheless, the Spanish
Insolvency Law establishes that the shares or quotas of companies exclusively destined to hold assets and the liabilities
necessary for their financing will not be considered necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s business, provided that the
enforcement of the security over the shares or quotas does not constitute a cause of termination or modification of those
contractual relationships of the company that allow the debtor to continue exploiting such assets.

The opening of the liquidation phase will result in the loss of the right to initiate the enforcement or compulsory
realisation of the security over assets and rights of the estate by those creditors who had not exercised these actions before the
opening of the insolvency proceedings or had not initiated them one year after such date. Secured creditors shall recover the
right of enforcement or compulsory realisation when one year has elapsed since the opening of the liquidation without the
affected asset or right having been disposed of.

_Limitation on validity and enforcement of Guarantees and the Collateral_

Enforcement of Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the provisions of Law of Civil Procedure (Ley de
_Enjuiciamiento Civil) (the “LEC 2000”) and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable) and this may entail delays in the_
enforcement.

Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (five years being the general term established for obligations in
_personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off_
or counterclaim.

The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof)
mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish
courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their
terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to:

##### • the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and

 • the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived) or counter-claim,
circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure,
unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, and abatement.

In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another obligation
to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the
guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails
nullity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security.
In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish
courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable.

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected (or registered or other
foreign equivalent) and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the Collateral
securing the Notes from time to time owned by us or the Guarantors may not be perfected (or registered or other foreign
equivalent), which may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection (or registration or other foreign equivalent),
of the security interest for the benefit of the Trustee and holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled.
Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee will be obligated to create or perfect any of the security interests in the Collateral.

Spanish law does not contemplate the concept of a “security agent”. Although this by itself does not prohibit this agent
to be set in place, the fact that there is a lack of regulation on the matter provides uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would
recognize the acting of the Security Agent in an enforcement situation. Since holders of the Notes will not have any independent
power to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Trustee,

48


-----

there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of the Security Agent or whether lack of
recognition would entail delays in the enforcement or even the consequence of the Collateral not being able to be enforced on
the same terms as provided for in the Security Documents by the Security Agent.

_Capitalization_

In addition, under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when
security interests are enforced. For instance, when the enforcement of the security interests cause the amount of the relevant
Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be
wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to re-establish the balance
between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency.

For more information, see “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime”.

**_The Collateral may be released without the consent of the holders of the Notes._**

The Collateral may be released in certain circumstances, including in the event the Collateral is sold pursuant to an
enforcement sale in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Upon any such enforcement sale in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement, all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors will be released and holders of the Notes will only
receive payment out of the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement”._

Additional Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture, might be secured by the Collateral without the need to either extend
it or create additional pledges.

**_Our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and to operate_**
**_our business._**

We have, and after this Offering will continue to have, a significant amount of indebtedness. As of March 31 2024,
on a consolidated basis, as adjusted for the Transactions, we would have had €1,494.8 million of financial debt, and subsidiaries
of the Company that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €21.8 million of other financial liabilities outstanding on a
consolidated basis. See “Capitalization”. We anticipate that our substantial indebtedness will continue for the foreseeable
future. Our substantial indebtedness may have important negative consequences for you, including:

    - making it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including
the Notes and other liabilities;

    - requiring that a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations of our operating subsidiaries be dedicated to
debt service obligations, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital
and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes;

    - increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry;

    - exposing us to interest rate increases;

    - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow;

    - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry;

    - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and

    - limiting, among others, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the
future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

In the worst case, an actual or impending inability by us or our subsidiaries to pay debts as they become due and
payable could result in our insolvency.

49


-----

In addition, the Indenture will contain, and the 2028 Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the agreement
governing the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility Agreement contain, restrictions that substantially limit our financial
and operational flexibility and that of our subsidiaries. In particular, these agreements place (or will place) limits on our ability
to incur additional indebtedness, grant security interests to third persons, dispose of material assets, undertake organizational
measures such as mergers, changes of corporate form, joint ventures or similar transactions and enter into transactions with
related parties. The Company may also, by agreement with the relevant lenders under RCF1 or RCF2 (as applicable), amend
the applicable Sustainability Provisions (as defined below) from time to time, which may make these more difficult to meet in
the future. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Despite our current substantial indebtedness, we may be able to incur more debt in the future, including on a_**
**_secured basis over the Collateral or otherwise, which could further exacerbate the risks of our indebtedness._**

We may incur additional debt in the future. The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for the Revolving Credit Facility
in an aggregate principal amount of €193.6 million (€4.5 million of which has been utilized as ancillary facilities), €130.0
million of which was drawn as of March 31, 2024. The Indenture will limit, and the 2028 Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the agreement governing the EIB Facilities and the agreement governing the COFIDES Facility limit, our ability
to incur additional debt but will not prohibit us from doing so. We may incur additional debt in the future, secured by the
Collateral or otherwise, which could mature prior to the Notes, and such debt could be secured on an equal, ratable and pari
_passu basis with the Notes and the Guarantees. Any non-Guarantor subsidiary could also incur additional debt, and the Notes_
and Guarantees would be structurally subordinated to any such debt.

**_The Company is dependent on payments from its subsidiaries in order to be able to make payments on the Notes,_**
**_and the Company’s subsidiaries may not be permitted or otherwise able to make payments to the Company._**

Even if the Company’s subsidiaries generate sufficient cash from their operations, their ability to provide funds to the
Company are subject to, among others, local tax restrictions and local corporate law restrictions related to earnings, the level
of legal or statutory reserves, losses from previous years and capitalization requirements for the Company’s subsidiaries. As a
result, although the Company’s subsidiaries may have sufficient resources, on a consolidated basis, to allow the Company to
make the necessary payments on the Notes, the Company’s subsidiaries may not be able to make the necessary transfers to
permit the Company to satisfy its obligations under the Notes or otherwise. In particular, the Company’s subsidiaries may be
restricted from providing funds to it under some circumstances. These circumstances include:

    - restrictions under the corporate law of the jurisdictions in which the Company’s subsidiaries are based. The
relevant laws could require, among others, that its subsidiaries retain a certain percentage of annual net income
in a legal reserve, that its subsidiaries maintain the share capital of a limited liability company and that, after
payment of any divided, the relevant subsidiary’s shareholders’ equity exceed its share capital. For example,
Spanish law limits certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to the Company due to
restrictions that require, among others, each of its Spanish subsidiaries to retain at least 10% of their annual profit
(beneficio) in a legal reserve until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital and that, after
payment of any dividend, shareholders’ equity must be equal to or exceed the company’s share capital. In addition,
in order for Spanish companies to distribute dividends available reserves must be equal to, or greater than, the
R&D expenses appearing in the balance sheet of the company. Moreover, the by-laws of each of the Company’s
Spanish subsidiaries may provide for additional reserves that must be retained prior to providing funds to it;

    - restrictions under foreign exchange laws and regulations that could limit or tax the remittance of dividends or
transfer payments abroad; and

    - existing and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities, cash pooling arrangements
and other indebtedness that affect the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other
payments to it in the future.

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and for other general corporate purposes. Our ability_**
**_to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

Our ability to make payments on our debt, and to fund working capital and capital expenditures, will depend on our
future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on general economic,

50


-----

financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors
discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and additional debt and equity financing may
not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes, or to fund our other
liquidity needs. For a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity, see “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects”.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as they
mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity.

We may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In
addition, the terms of our debt, including the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Notes, and any future debt that we may incur,
may limit our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_One of the Guarantees will be limited to a specified amount and each of the Guarantees are significantly limited_**
**_by applicable laws (including insolvency laws) and are subject to certain limitations or defenses._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the payment of the Notes as described in “Description of the Notes—The Note
_Guarantees”. The Guarantees provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However,_
the guarantee of Grupo Antolín Lusitânia—Componentes Automóvel, Unipessoal, Lda. will be limited to a maximum amount
of €17.8 million. In addition, the Guarantees of the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited under the
Indenture to an amount that has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws
relating to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation (under which, among others, the risks associated with a
guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally
justified from the Guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective), thin capitalization, corporate purpose, financial assistance, business
rescue proceedings or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law
or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach
of applicable corporate, commercial and/or criminal law for providing such Guarantee. If these limitations were not observed,
the Guarantees and the grant of security interests by the Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge.

As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under its Guarantees could be materially reduced or eliminated depending upon the
amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee issued by a
company that is not in that company’s corporate interests or the burden of which exceeds the benefit to the company may not
be valid and enforceable. It is possible that a Guarantor, a creditor of a Guarantor or the insolvency administrator, in the case
of an insolvency of a Guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the respective Guarantee and that the applicable
court may determine that the Guarantee should be limited or voided. In the event that any Guarantee is deemed invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent that agreed limitations on the Guarantee apply, the Notes would not be
guaranteed by such Guarantee.

**_Changes in, or uncertainty relating to, the benchmark calculation process may increase our costs and reduce our_**
**_cash flow._**

The Senior Facilities bear interest at variable rates based on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”) (in respect
of the amortizing Facility A loans denominated in euro and any drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility denominated in
euro), or the Compounded Reference Rate (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) (in respect of any drawings under
the Revolving Credit Facility denominated in any currency other than euro) plus an applicable margin. In the case of EURIBOR,
this is subject to a zero percent per annum floor, which is deemed to be a “benchmark” and has been the subject of recent
national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.

51


-----

Some reforms are already effective including the Benchmarks Regulations and the cessation of the publication of the
sterling LIBOR benchmark and the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the
euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, among others,
new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among others,
that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the
euro area financial system. These reforms and recommendations may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the
past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.

Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and the Benchmarks (Amendment and Transitional Provision) (EU Exit) Regulations
2019 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the
contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within Europe and the United Kingdom. Among others,
it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU- or UK-based, to be subject to an
equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU- and UK- supervised entities of
benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU- or UK-based, not deemed equivalent or
recognized or endorsed).

The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Facilities if the methodology or other terms
of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could,
among others, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the
relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of
benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and
complying with any such regulations or requirements.

It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, the various benchmarks will continue to be
supported going forward. This may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, and may have other
consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain
benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering
changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any
of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or
investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported benchmarks, which could have an adverse impact on
the interest we pay on borrowings under the Senior Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly,
including as a result of changing macro-economic conditions, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby
reducing our cash flow and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. None of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Indenture contains or will contain (as applicable) a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt.

Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there
can be no assurance that hedging will be or will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself
carries certain risks, including credit risk in relation to such hedging counterparties and the risk that we may need to pay a
significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise
significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our counterparties
falls into bankruptcy, any claims we have under hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we
refinance our debt or otherwise terminate any such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments,
which would result in a loss.

**_Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of Notes._**

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance laws, a court could
subordinate or void a Guarantee if it found that:

    - the Guarantee was incurred with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the
Guarantor;

    - the Guarantee was granted within two years prior to the insolvency declaration of the Guarantor and it is
detrimental for the Guarantor’s state;

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee and the
Guarantor:

52


-----

    - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee;

    - was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee;

    - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or

    - the Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in the best interest
or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor.

The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law applied.
Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court
decided that any Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other
reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor of such Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of the
Company and the remaining Guarantors. See “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime”.

In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator
may challenge the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other
grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a
Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee; (ii) direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to
the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and (iii) take other action that is detrimental to
you.

**_Spanish and local insolvency laws may not be as favorable to you as U.S. bankruptcy laws or the insolvency laws_**
**_of other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar._**

The Company is organized under the laws of Spain and therefore any insolvency proceedings against the Company
and the Spanish obligors would likely be based on Spanish insolvency laws. The Guarantors are organized under the laws of
Spain and other jurisdictions. See “Summary—The Offering—Guarantors”. The insolvency laws of these other jurisdictions
may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of some other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar.
Certain provisions of the insolvency laws in these jurisdictions could affect the ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees or
claims relating to the Notes and the Guarantees on an insolvency of the Company or the Guarantors, as the case may be.

Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after
it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its
insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency
occur and failure to file a petition for insolvency within such statutory two month period may lead to personal liability of the
directors for the unpaid claims.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply
if the debtor serves notice upon the applicable court of the Opening of Negotiations Communication.

The general principle of “no termination effect” (principio general de vigencia de los contratos) is established
pursuant to Article 156 of the Spanish Insolvency Law such that agreements remain effective at the time of the insolvency.
Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of the contracts entered into by the debtor, which would
remain in force. Any contractual arrangements establishing the termination, suspension or amendment of a contract and/or
entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable.

Under Spanish law, a creditor’s rights will be subordinated to the preferential and ordinary debts of a debtor in an
insolvency proceeding if such creditor is determined to be a “specially related party” to the debtor. Under Spanish law, factors
considered in determining if a party is “specially related party”, among others, are (i) limited liability shareholders holding,
directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company's share capital (or 5% if the company is listed or has securities
listed in a secondary official market) at the time when the relevant credit right arises, (ii) directors or liquidators of the debtor
(whether de facto or de jure) or have held such position in the two years prior to the insolvency declaration; or or (iii) companies
pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum
shareholding requirements set forth in (i) above.

Additionally, under Spanish law payments made under an equitably subordinated loan preceding the bankruptcy of an
obligor may in certain circumstances be clawed back.

-----

In order to seek protection against claw back, restructuring plans (out-of-court workouts) may be judicially sanctioned
(homologado) by the commercial court that would be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding of the debtor,
upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, if they comply with certain
requirements, such as -but not limited to- the following: (i) the debtor is in technical or imminent insolvency, or under likelihood
of insolvency, and the plan ensures its viability in the short or medium term; (ii) the restructuring plan affects claims which
represent at least 51% of all the liabilities of the debtor (60% in case the clawback protection fall upon financing granted by
specially related persons to the debtor); (iii) the restructuring plan is approved by the relevant majorities within the classes of
claims (2/3 of the claims in unsecured classes and 3/4 of the claims in secured classes) and approved by all classes (consensual
plan) or, if not by all (non-consensual plan), at least by (a) a simple majority of classes, if one of them is composed of claims
that could be classified as secured claims or general preferred claims in an insolvency proceeding; or (b) one class of creditors
that may reasonably be presumed to have received any payment following an assessment of the debtor as a going concern; (iv)
the appointed restructuring expert (or the auditor in case of restructuring plans approved by all classes of claims), issues a
certificate acknowledging the sufficiency of the majorities required to homologate the restructuring plan; (v) the restructuring
plan has to treat all claims in the same class equally and has to be notified to all affected creditors; (vi) the restructuring plan is
formalized before a public notary.

Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw back action, except in the case of fraud of
creditors (fraude de acreedores).

As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached for a restructuring plan, all creditors
holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the restructuring plan (for the purposes of petitioning
protection against claw back) if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan (assuming
it was secured by right-in-rem security interest; or above 66.6% in other cases), or a lower majority if so established in the
syndicated loan agreement.

For more information, see “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime—Spain—Insolvency regime”.

**_Not all of our subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes, and any claim by us or any of our creditors, including the_**
**_holders of the Notes, against such non-Guarantor subsidiaries will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of_**
**_creditors of those non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

Not all of our existing and future subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes. On a consolidated basis as of March 31, 2024,
we had total assets of €3,207.6 million and, after giving effect to the Transactions, financial debt of €1,494.8 million. The
Guarantors, together with the Company, represent 54.3% and 64.2% of the Group’s total Management EBITDA and net
turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Company that will not
guarantee the Notes would have had €21.8 million of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024 on a consolidated basis, as adjusted
for the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. The Indenture does not limit the transfer of assets to, or the
making of investments in, any of our restricted group members, including our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Please see
“Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants”. Accordingly, even though certain of our material subsidiaries will be required
to provide an additional Guarantee for the benefit of the Notes pursuant to the Indenture, non-Guarantor subsidiaries could
account for a higher portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and net income in the future. See “Description of the Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Additional Note Guarantees”._

In the event that any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or
otherwise winds up, the assets of such non-Guarantor subsidiary will not be subject to claims from the holders of the Notes to
satisfy their respective credits against us and will be used first to satisfy the claims of the non-Guarantor subsidiary’s creditors,
including trade creditors, banks and other lenders. Consequently, any claim by us or our creditors against a non-Guarantor
subsidiary will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of such non-Guarantor subsidiary.

**_The Company may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. In addition, under certain_**
**_circumstances, the Company may have the right to purchase all outstanding Notes in connection with a tender offer, even_**
**_if certain holders do not consent to the tender._**

If a change of control (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer to purchase
all the outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus any accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option
_of Holders—Change of Control”. In such a situation, the Company may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that_
are tendered under any such offer. If a significant principal amount of Notes is tendered, the Company will likely have to obtain

54


-----

financing to pay for the tendered Notes. However, the Company may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms,
if at all. Additionally, certain change of control events would be prepayment events under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In
the event this results in an event of default thereunder, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement may accelerate such
debt, which could also cause an event of default under the Indenture.

The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of
certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar
transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power
or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture. In addition, the
occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control,
provided that upon consummation thereof, a specified leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

In addition, in connection with certain tender offers for the Notes for any series, if holders of not less than 90% in
aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in such
tender offer and the Company, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Company, purchases, all of the Notes
of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Company or such third party will have the right to
redeem the Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price equal to
the price offered to each other holder of Notes of such series. See “Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption.”

**_The term “all or substantially all” in the context of a change of control has no clearly established meaning under_**
**_relevant law and is subject to judicial interpretation such that it may not be certain that a change of control has occurred_**
**_or will occur._**

Upon the occurrence of a transaction that constitutes a change of control under the Indenture, the Issuer will be required
to make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes tendered. The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture will
include (with certain exceptions) a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries
(taken as a whole) to any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,”
it has no clearly established meaning under relevant law, varies according to the facts and circumstances of the subject
transaction and is subject to judicial interpretation. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty
in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person,
and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer
to repurchase the Notes.

**_You may be unable to enforce judgments against us, the Guarantors or our respective directors and officers._**

Neither the Company nor most of the Guarantors are incorporated in the United States. In addition, most of our assets
are outside the United States and all of our directors and officers live outside the United States, primarily in Spain. As a result,
it may be difficult or impossible to serve process against any of these persons in the United States. Furthermore, because a
substantial part of the assets of these persons are located outside of the United States, it may not be possible to enforce
judgments obtained in courts in the United States predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the
United States against these persons. Additionally, there is doubt as to the enforceability in many foreign jurisdictions, including
Spain, of civil liabilities based on the civil liability provisions of the federal or state securities laws of the United States against
the Company, the Guarantors, the directors, controlling persons and management and any experts named in this Offering
Memorandum who are not residents of the United States. See “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime”.

**_The interests of our ultimate controlling shareholders may be inconsistent with the interest of holders of the Notes_**
**_and/or our ultimate controlling shareholders may sell their stake in future._**

Our ultimate controlling shareholders are members of the Antolín family. See “Shareholders and Certain
_Transactions”. As a result, our ultimate controlling shareholders have and will continue to have direct or indirect power, among_
others, to influence our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change our
management and to approve other changes to our operations. The interests of our ultimate controlling shareholders could
conflict with your interests, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. In
addition, our controlling parties may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete with ours in certain respects or do
business with us.

**_There are risks related to withholding tax in Spain, including in connection with the listing of the Notes._**

Although application will be made to admit the Notes to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for
trading on the Euro MTF in accordance with its rules, there are no assurances that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and
admitted to trade on the Euro MTF.

One of the conditions set forth in additional provision 1 of Law 10/2014 and in the Regulations approved by Royal
Decree 1065/ 2007 for the income to be paid in respect of the Notes not to be subject to Spanish withholding tax is that the
Notes must be admitted to listing on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized market.

The Company believes that this will be the case. However, prospective investors should note that, if the Notes are not
listed on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized market on any date on which income
in respect of the Notes will be paid (i.e., either a date on which interest is payable on the Notes or a date on which the Notes
are transferred or redeemed), payments of income to holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes might be subject to Spanish
withholding tax at the then-applicable rate (currently, 19%) except in certain cases, as described in “Taxation - Taxation in
_Spain -_ _Tax rules for Notes not listed on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized market_
_on any interest payment date._

**_There are risks related to withholding tax in Spain, including in connection with the delivery of certain_**
**_documentation by the Paying Agent._**

Under Spanish tax regulations, the Company will not be required to levy any withholding tax in Spain on income paid
by the Company in respect of the Notes provided that certain requirements are met, including that the Notes are listed on a
regulated market, multilateral trading facility or other organized market on any interest payment date as set forth in the
Indenture, the Notes are originally registered with the entities that manage clearing systems located outside of Spain (such as
Euroclear and Clearstream), and are recognized by Spanish law or by the law of another OECD country and provided further
that the Paying Agent provides the Company, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed statement (the “Payment
**Statement”) with the following information:**

    - Identification of the securities;

    - Income payment date;

    - Total amount of the income; and

    - Total amount of income corresponding to securities held through each clearing system located outside Spain (such
as Euroclear or Clearstream).

These obligations refer to the total amount paid under the Notes to investors through each foreign clearing system.
For these purposes, “income” means interest and the difference, if any, between the aggregate amount payable on the
redemption or retirement of the Notes and the issue price of the Notes.

It is expected that the Paying Agent will follow certain procedures to facilitate the timely provision to the Company
of a duly executed and completed Payment Statement in connection with each payment under the Notes. If such procedures are
not followed, however, income paid by the Company in respect of the Notes will be subject to withholding tax in Spain, at the
current rate of 19%, and the payments the Company makes in respect of the Notes will be net of such withholding tax. See
“Taxation” for a more detailed explanation.

However, if the payment of income is not exempt from Spanish withholding tax due to any failure by the Paying
Agent to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment Statement to the Company, the affected holders of the Notes will
receive a refund of the amount withheld, with no need for action on their part, if the Paying Agent submits a duly executed and
completed Payment Statement to the Company no later than the 10[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the
relevant payment date.

Prospective investors should note that neither the Company nor the Initial Purchasers accept any responsibility relating
to compliance by the Paying Agent with the procedures established for the timely provision by the Paying Agent of a duly
executed and completed Payment Statement in connection with each payment of income under the Notes. Accordingly, neither
the Company nor the Initial Purchasers will be liable for any damage or loss suffered by any holder of the Notes who would

56


-----

otherwise be entitled to an exemption from Spanish withholding tax because of the Paying Agent’s failure to comply with these
procedures or because of these procedures prove ineffective. Moreover, the Company will not pay any additional amounts with
respect to any such withholding. Therefore, to the extent a payment of income in respect of the Notes is not exempt from
Spanish withholding tax, including due to any failure by the Paying Agent to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment
Statement, holders of the Notes may have to apply directly to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be
entitled (with no responsibility for the Company or the Initial Purchasers). See “Taxation” for a more detailed explanation.
Prospective investors should seek specific advice in this regard.

**_There is no existing public trading market for the Notes and the ability to transfer them is limited, which may_**
**_adversely affect the value of the Notes._**

The Notes are a new issue. There is no existing trading market for the Notes and there can be no assurance that a
trading market for the Notes will develop. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the
development of an active trading market or how liquid that trading market might become. Although the Initial Purchasers have
advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, they are not obligated to do so and may stop at any time. The market
price of our Notes may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:

    - changes in demand, the supply or pricing of our products;

    - general economic conditions, including material prices;

    - the activities of competitors;

    - our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;

    - investors’ perceptions of us and the automotive industry;

    - the failure of securities analysts to cover our Notes after this Offering or changes in financial estimates by analysts;

    - the public’s reaction to our press releases or our other public announcements;

    - future sales of Notes; and

    - other factors described under these “Risk Factors”.

As a result of these factors, you may not be able to resell your Notes at or above the initial offering price. In addition,
securities trading markets experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate
to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations and industry factors may materially
reduce the market price of our Notes, regardless of our operating performance. If an active trading market does not develop,
you may have difficulty selling any Notes that you buy.

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any U.S. securities laws and we have
not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in the future. You may not offer the Notes for sale in the United
States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. The Notes and the Indenture will contain
provisions that will restrict the Notes from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions
available pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions under the Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not
registered the Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the
Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “Notice to Investors”. In
addition, by its acceptance of delivery of any Notes, the holder thereof agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor
accounts for which it has purchased the Notes that it shall not transfer the Notes in an amount less than €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 thereafter.

**_Certain covenants may be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in our ratings._**

The Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indenture, any series of the Notes receive a
rating of “Baa3” or better from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) or “BBB-” or better from Standard & Poor’s
Investors Ratings Services (“S&P”) and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day

57


-----

and continuing until such time that the Notes receive a rating below “Baa3” from Moody’s or “BBB-” from S&P, certain
covenants will cease to be applicable to the Notes. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Certain
_Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade.” If these covenants were to cease to be applicable, we would be able to incur_
additional indebtedness or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders
of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will
be maintained.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the gross proceeds of the Offering will be approximately €250.0 million. On the Issue Date, we
intend to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem or repurchase the entire outstanding
amount of the 2026 Notes and (ii) pay commissions, fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the Notes. See “Use
of Proceeds”.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions. Actual
amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including accrued interest on the debt being repaid
and the actual date of repayment of such debt, changes in our cash position on the actual Issue Date, fluctuations in currency
exchange rates for amounts not denominated in euro, differences from our estimates of fees, expenses and commissions and
any original issue discount. For descriptions of our current and anticipated indebtedness following the offering of the Notes
and the use of proceeds therefrom, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.”

or TCOs, in 25 countries worldwide as of December 31, 2023. We supplied our products globally to over 100 different
automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs in 2023. We provided components for more than 600 different vehicle
models, representing approximately one out of every three vehicles manufactured worldwide. Our product, geographical and
customer diversification allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, in particular our presence in Eastern
Europe, North America, South America and Asia, which in the past has mitigated the impact of regional production fluctuations
on our business during periods of economic downturn. We are headquartered in Burgos, Spain, and in 2023 our average number
of employees was approximately 23,000.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we generated a net turnover of €4,617.4 million, consolidated profit for the
year of €12.6 million and a Management EBITDA of €328.4 million, representing increases of 3.7% (or 5.3% on a constant
currency basis), 106.0% and 10.5%, respectively, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. For the three months ended
March 31, 2024, we generated a net turnover of €1,039.3 million, consolidated profit for the period of €0.1 million and a
Management EBITDA of €82.8 million, representing a decrease of 10.1% (or 6.6% on a constant currency basis), an increase
of 101.0% and an increase of 19.5%, respectively, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

We organize our activities around two business segments: Product Systems and Technology Solutions. In addition,
we also review our results of operations on a geographical basis.

**_Product Systems_**

Our Product Systems segment is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard Trim, (iii) Instrument
Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) Components and JITs.

  - _Headliners: we are a leader in the manufacturing of headliner modular solutions, incorporating acoustic, safety,_
panoramic and lighting functionalities with a strong sustainability focus. We cover the entire product spectrum for
overhead systems, from the headliner substrate to more complex modular systems. We use key technologies for
headliner substrates and benefit from full vertical integration, from the core polyurethane foam production to the final
assembly of the overhead systems. Net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Headliners
division amounted to €1,135.8 million and €103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which
represented 25% and 23% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and
Management segment EBITDA, respectively, for that same period. In 2023, we were a global leader in overhead

systems, with approximately 22% of the global market share. We achieved a leading position across most regions in
overhead systems, with a 33% market share in Europe, 62% market share in South America and a 31% market share
in North America. As of December 31, 2023, the Headliners division included 36 manufacturing facilities.

  - _Doors & Hard Trim: we have expertise in the manufacturing and supply of a wide range of door systems such as door_
panels (including front, rear and sliding door panels) and pillars (including upper and lower pillar trim and quarter
trim panels). We produce a wide range of specialized plastic parts, some of which benefit from weight reduction and
environmentally friendly properties, which we believe are features highly demanded by OEMs. Our decoration inserts
supplied in partnership with Walter Pack provide an answer to the increasing demands in interior personalization. Net
turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Doors & Hard Trim division amounted to €1,808.0
million and €196.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented 38% and 44% of
our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA,
respectively, for that same period. In 2023, we were a leading doors and hard trim producer in Europe with a market
share of over 16% in door panels. We also estimate having a market share of approximately 8% in door panels in
North America in 2023, compared to a global market share of approximately 6%. We believe that our largest market
share for pillar trim panels in 2023 was in North America, with approximately 7%, followed by a smaller market share
of approximately 2% in Asia. As of December 31, 2023, our Doors & Hard Trim business division included 31
manufacturing facilities.

  - _Instrument Panels and Central Consoles: we are a global producer and supplier of cockpit modules, including_
instrument panels, center consoles and glove boxes, which we design, engineer and manufacture. Our capabilities
include design and engineering, styling, tooling, manufacturing, and electrical/electronic system integration. The
cockpit module plays a key role in defining the driver’s experience and it integrates the instrument panel and several
control functions such as wiring harness, instrument cluster, air vents, decorative inlays, glove boxes and passenger
airbag systems, among others. The instrument panel is a key element of the cockpit module and is comprised of a
sophisticated system of trims, foams, composites, and metals. The central consoles are designed and manufactured to
operate vehicle functions and store items. The primary technologies and processes involved in the manufacturing of
these systems include low pressure and injection molding, compression molding, vacuum forming, slush skins, spray
urethane and decorative stitching. Net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to this division
amounted to €544.0 million and €47.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented
12% and 11% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management
segment EBITDA, respectively, for that same period. As of December 31, 2023, the Instrument Panels and Central
Consoles division included 10 manufacturing facilities.

  - _Components and JITs: we operate assembly and sequencing facilities together with some products such as sun visors,_
window regulators and soft trim (including load floors, package trays, side linings, accessible floor bins and floor
coverings). Our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to the components & JITs division
amounted to €725.3 million and €47.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented
16% and 11% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management
segment EBITDA, respectively, for that same period. In 2023, we were a leading producer of window regulators in
Europe with a market share of 23%. We were also a significant producer of window regulators in South America with
a market share of over 17%. Our global market share for window regulars was approximately 6% in 2023. In sun
visors, we were a leader in the European market with a market share of 31% in 2023. Our global market share in sun
visors was approximately 12% for the same year. As of December 31, 2023, the components & JITs division included
26 manufacturing facilities.

Our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Product Systems segment amounted to
€4,213.0 million and €395.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, which represented 91.3% and 88.2%
of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA for
that same period, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net turnover and Management segment
EBITDA attributable to our Product Systems segment amounted to €940.6 million and €86.2 million, respectively, which
represented 90.6% and 82.1% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and
Management segment EBITDA for that same period, respectively.

This represents an 11.9% decrease in net turnover and a 7.2% increase in Management segment EBITDA, compared
to the three months ended March 31, 2023, when the net turnover and the Management segment EBITDA attributable to our
Product Systems segment amounted to €1,067.1 million and €80.4 million, respectively. In 2023, we were a leader in overhead
systems, with approximately 22% of the global market share. Our market shares for overhead systems in Europe & ROW,

62


-----

North America and Asia in 2023 were 38%, 31% and 12%, respectively. In sun visors, we were a leader in Europe & ROW
with a market share of 31%. As of March 31, 2024, the Product Systems business segment included 103 manufacturing
facilities.

**_Technology Solutions_**

Our Technology Solutions segment includes (i) Lighting, (ii) HMI and (iii) Electronics Systems products.

Our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA attributable to our Technology Solutions segment amounted to
€400.1 million and €53.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023, which represented 8.7% and 11.8% of
our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA for the
same period, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our net turnover and Management segment EBITDA
attributable to our Technology Solutions segment amounted to €97.3 million and €18.8 million, respectively, which represented
9.4% and 17.9% of our combined Product Systems and Technology Solutions segments net turnover and Management segment
EBITDA for the same period, respectively. These figures represent a 9.9% increase in net turnover and a 27.9% increase in
Management segment EBITDA compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, when the net turnover and Management
segment EBITDA attributable to our Technology Solutions segment were €88.5 million and €14.7 million & ROW,
respectively. In 2023 we were a leading manufacturer of interior automotive lighting components in Europe, with a market
share of overhead front consoles and dome lamps of 31% in 2023, and a relevant supplier in the ambient light segment,
especially for premium vehicles. We believe we also had a leading market share in lighting components in North America
amounting to approximately 19% for the same year, and a market share in Asia of 4%, which we expect to be a geographical
area of focus for the Group in the coming years. As of December 31, 2023, our Technology Solutions segment included 15
manufacturing facilities.

The charts below show the percentage of net turnover and Management segment EBITDA derived per business
segment for the year ended December 31, 2023 (excluding “others”):

Net turnover in 2023 Management segment EBITDA in 2023

We believe that our financial and operational success and stability have been, and continue to be, driven by our
strategic, customer-focused geographical growth and diversified net turnover streams, as well as our manufacturing, process,
design and technological expertise. We believe that these factors have allowed us to achieve our position as a leading global
supplier in the automotive industry, with high strategic importance to many of the largest OEMs. See “Summary—Summary

**Segment Reporting**

Our basis of segmentation is by business unit and by geography, which reflects the management structure of our
business and our system of internal financial reporting. We report net turnover, other operating expenses/income, net,
Management segment EBITDA and Management segment EBITDA margin on a segmental basis.

The net turnover reported for each segment are those which are directly attributable to the production plants included
in that segment for management purposes and therefore also include secondary revenues recognized by said plants in respect
of sales for the provision of services to other segments. The income of each segment does not include interest or dividend
income or the gains on sales of investments or of non-current assets. The expenses of each segment are calculated as being the
expenses arising out of the operating activities of the segment that may be directly attributed to the plants included in that
segment for management purposes. The expenses of each segment do not include interest expense, impairments or losses on
sales of investments or of non-current assets. Assets and liabilities in the segments are those that are directly connected with
the operations of the plants in each segment, although virtually all the financial debt of the Group has been centralized in the
corporate unit.

The segmental financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for the year ended December 31, 2023,
including the prior-year comparative figures for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the segmental financial
information contained in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, including
comparative financial information for the three months ended March 31, 2023, gives effect to the 2023 Reporting Change.
However, we did not restate the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 in order to
reflect the 2023 Segment Reporting Change, and no segmental financial information for the year ended December 31, 2021 is
discussed herein. See “—Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Results—2023 Segment Reporting Change”.

The table below includes a comparison of net turnover, operating expenses/other operating income, net, Management
segment EBITDA and Management segment EBITDA margin for each business segment for the years ended December 31,
2022 and 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024.

**Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

We believe that the following factors impact our results of operations:

**_Capital expenditure_**

Our capital expenditure is incurred primarily in connection with the acquisition or construction of new plants,
including the purchase of tooling and other equipment for new or existing plants, as well as R&D expenses. Our business
involves significant capital expenditure both on material fixed assets such as property, plant and equipment and on intangible
assets mainly linked to R&D. Capital expenditure is essential to maintain our long-term relationships with our clients, which
are based on our capacity to offer technologically advanced interior automotive solutions at competitive prices. Capital
expenditure on intangible assets is related to innovation in design and materials, so that our products contribute to the perceived
value in the interior of the vehicle. Once a project is ongoing, maintenance capital expenditure is limited and somewhat
predictable. When new programs or vehicle models are required, usually at the end of a vehicle cycle, “renewal” or
“replacement” capital expenditure is required in order to adapt existing infrastructure to accommodate new assembly and
process design, usually at levels significantly below the expenditure required to create the capacity in the first place. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, we had capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment of €120.7 million and capital
expenditures in intangible assets of €132.3 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had capital expenditures
in property, plant and equipment of €24.3 million and capital expenditures in intangible assets of €28.2 million.

Capitalized development expenditures amounted to 75.4% of the cost of our intangible assets as of December 31, 2023
and 74.7% as of March 31, 2024. Among the main additions to development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023
and the three months ended March 31, 2024 were projects including Chevrolet “G1Yx (Traverse)”, Porsche “Macan NF PO426
EU22 IP”, Jeep “Cherokee Panel”, Audi “Q7/Q9 Panel”, Mini “F6X EU24 IP”, Cadillac “l232 EV” PlasticP, Ford “Puma
Console” and Renault “5 ECHO Panel” projects, for some of which mass production began in 2023. The costs incurred in each
development project are capitalized when the following conditions are met: (i) the development cost of the asset can be assessed

65


-----

reliably, (ii) the costs are specifically itemized for each project and correspond to an identifiable asset, (iii) we can prove that
the project is technically viable and (iv) the project is likely to generate profits in the future.

Once the projects are completed and go into production, capitalized development expenses begin to be amortized.
Capitalized development expenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the projects.

**_Global automotive market_**

We operate within the global automotive equipment sector and our business growth is entirely driven by trends in the
global automobile market. The cycles of the global automotive industry, which are correlated with general global
macroeconomic conditions, impact our OEM customers’ production requirements and consequently impact the volume of
purchases of our products by our OEM customers. With increased economic activity in our growth markets and recovery in
our more traditional markets, we have experienced and expect to experience increased vehicle production levels, with a
consequent increase in the demand for our products and a positive impact on our revenues. Slower economic growth would
have the opposite effect.

**_Diversification_**

Our strong geographic, customer and product diversification have the effect of reducing revenue volatility during
economic downturns, as well as limiting our exposure to regional business cycles. Our well-diversified customer base,
including 100 different automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs as of December 31, 2023, has limited our
exposure to a downturn in the demand for any one OEM’s product portfolio. Regional differences in duration, timing and
intensity of economic cycles, combined with the diversity of our geographic footprint, have mitigated the effects of the
economic cycle on our business, limiting the impact of our exposure to the cycle in any one region or geography. Our stable
revenues have allowed us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, even during economic downturns.

The net turnover received from our five largest customers, Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and
Tata Motors—Jaguar Land Rover, represented 65.4% of total net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was
lower than the share of our total net turnover from our five largest customers for the year ended December 31, 2022 (67.0%),
and 65.7% of the total net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was lower than their relative share of
total net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (67.1%). The below graphics demonstrate these same breakdowns
in previous years (namely, 2000, 2007 and 2014):

-----

In terms of geographic diversification, the U.S., China and Mexico were the three highest net turnover generating
geographies and represented 43.5% of our net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 47.2% of our net
turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023, which compares with 44.6% of our net turnover for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 48.7% of our net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2022, in which the main markets were the
U.S., China and Germany.

**_Price of materials_**

A significant part of our cost base consists of purchases of materials which are variable in nature. The primary
materials used in our production facilities are textile fabrics, plastic injection grain, petroleum-based resins and certain metals
(primarily copper). For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, the costs of materials and other supplies has
represented on average 66.4% of our net turnover. Materials and other supplies, packaging and containers, replacement parts,
sundry materials, add-on parts and stocks for resale are valued at the lower of cost applying the weighted average price method,
and net realizable value. While prices of materials affect our net turnover and costs, historically, our profit margins have not
been significantly affected by changes in prices of materials. We work with a diversified group of suppliers across the world.
We try to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation costs. We
have not experienced any significant shortages of materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess
of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules. We estimate that approximately 45% of the value of the
materials we source come from suppliers chosen by OEMs, which allows us to benefit from their enhanced negotiation power
and to be automatically compensated by the applicable OEM for any increase of material costs. In situations where we
renegotiate terms with OEMs in order to pass on cost increases of materials, we must bear the increased costs until the
negotiations are finalized, which often takes between three and six months.

**_Operating costs_**

Staff costs have represented 19.3% of our net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 20.9% of our net
turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024. A significant part of our staff costs are semi-variable in nature and can
be adjusted to meet business needs. The predictability of our cost-base has assisted our strategic planning and has allowed us
to maintain consistent profit margins.

We do not have any defined benefit pension, workforce post-retirement health care benefits or employer paid
post-retirement basic life insurance benefits obligations. However, some of our subsidiaries forming part of our lighting and
Instrument Panels and Central Consoles division have assumed commitments to pay contributions to the retirement pensions
of some of their current and former employees. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these commitments primarily affected
companies located in Germany, Austria, France, India and the United Kingdom.

A significant portion of these commitments has been outsourced and are covered by insurance policies or pension
plans with insurance companies. We pay fixed contributions into a fund and are obliged to make additional contributions if the
fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all the employees the benefits to which it has committed.

We record the present value of these defined benefit commitments as liabilities in the consolidated statements of
financial position under “Non-current provisions”, net of the fair value of the assets that meet the requirements to be treated as
“assets earmarked for the plan”.

The net provision as of December 31, 2023 stood at €17.2 million, comprised of €30.9 million relating to the present
value of the defined benefit obligations and €13.7 million relating to the fair value of the pension assets. As of March 31, 2024,
the net provision stood at €15.5 million, comprised of €30.9 million relating to the value of the defined benefit obligations at
the end of 2023, and €13.7 million relating to the value of the pension assets, and reduced by €1.7 million due to different
changes during the first three months of the year.

**_Vehicle cycles_**

In our industry, once a project has been nominated to a preferred supplier, it is rare for an OEM to switch to another
supplier, given the significant operational, technical and logistical costs of switching suppliers, particularly during the life cycle
of a specific vehicle model. Vehicle models typically have long, multi-year product life cycles. Given these factors, while the
actual revenues which we derive from a project ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for
the respective car models, we have good visibility on mid-term revenues within a relatively small range of sensitivity.

67


-----

**_Product pricing_**

During the life cycle of a contract, we are expected to achieve production efficiencies. Typically, in line with our
industry practice, we pass on a portion of these production efficiencies to our customers by way of price reductions during the
term of the contract. When negotiated price reductions are expected to be retroactive, we accrue for such amounts as a reduction
of revenues as products are shipped. To the extent we are not able to achieve the efficiencies necessary to offset the price
reductions, such price reductions negatively impact our margins. Some pricing agreements with our customers are conditional
upon achieving certain joint cost-saving targets.

**_Seasonality_**

Our business is seasonal. Due to the following factors, our working capital requirements typically increase during the
first and third quarters of the year and reduce towards the end of the year. OEMs typically slow down vehicle production during
certain portions of the year. For instance, our customers in the United States typically slow down vehicle production during the
beginning of the second half of July and August and our European customers slow down vehicle production in August, and
both geographies slow down production during the holiday season in December during which they also often conduct internal
maintenance and adjustments to inventory. Further, there are a fewer number of working days at the end of the year as opposed
to the beginning of a year and this results in a reduction in vehicle production towards the end of such year. Also, we typically
agree final due amounts with our suppliers at year-end, which are usually paid at the beginning of the following year, resulting
in higher payables at year-end and significant cash outflows during January and February. Further, a significant portion of our
tooling receivables balances are invoiced from our clients typically before year-end, resulting in a reduction in receivables and
cash inflows at the end of the year. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may therefore be impacted by these
seasonal practices.

**_Transaction and foreign exchange translation_**

Although our reporting currency is the euro, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies,
such as among others the U.S. dollar, UK pound, the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee, the Mexican peso,
the Czech crown and the Hungarian forint. Although we have not entered into any foreign-currency hedge rate agreements or
forward contracts, we seek a variety of mechanisms to hedge against major movements in currencies, such as using local
suppliers and negotiating with customers and suppliers. We may also use a combination of natural hedging techniques and
financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. However, the translation of foreign
currencies back to the euro may have a significant impact on our revenues and financial results. Foreign exchange has an
unfavorable impact on revenues when the euro is relatively strong as compared with foreign currencies and a favorable impact
on revenues when the euro is relatively weak as compared with foreign currencies. The functional currency of our foreign
operations is the local currency.

The statements of financial position and income statements of the foreign companies included in the scope of
consolidation, denominated in currencies other than the euro, were translated to euro using the “closing rate method”. All the
assets, rights and obligations of these companies were translated to euro at the applicable year-end exchange rates. Their share
capital and reserves were translated at their historical exchange rates. To counteract seasonal effects, the income statement
items of these companies were translated to euro at the average exchange rates for the year, based on the volume of transactions
performed in each period. The exchange differences arising from the application of these methods are taken to equity under
“Remeasurements-Exchange differences” in the consolidated statements of financial position, net of the portion of these
differences corresponding to non-controlling interests, which is taken to equity under “Non-controlling interests” in the
consolidated statements of financial position. Such translation differences are recognized as income or as expense in the year
in which the investment is made or divested. Usually, we do not enter into foreign-currency swap agreements or forward
contracts.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, an additional 5% rise in the euro against currencies such as the Czech crown,
the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso, the UK pound and the Chinese renminbi, would have reduced our net
turnover by approximately €128 million.

**_Acquisitions and disposals_**

**Key Factors Affecting Comparability of Results**

**_2023 Segment Reporting Change_**

From January 1, 2023, we have reduced our number of business segments from three to two, and accordingly split our
operations into traditional business segments named (i) “Product Systems” and (ii) “Technology Solutions”, respectively. Our
“Product Systems” business encompasses several products such as headliners, doors and hard trim, instrument panels, central
consoles, sun visors, window regulators and trunk parts, and is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard
Trim, (iii) Instrument Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) components & JITs. Our “Technology Solutions” business is
comprised of (i) Lighting, (ii) HMI and (iii) Electronics Systems products. As a result of the 2023 Segment Reporting Change,
the segmental financial information contained in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31,
2023, including the prior-year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, give effect to the new split
of our business. We did not restate the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 in order
to reflect the 2023 Segment Reporting Change and, as a result, the segmental financial information presented in the Audited
Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including the prior-year comparative figures as of and
for the year ended December 31, 2021) is therefore not directly comparable to the segmental financial information presented
in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the prior-year comparative

-----

figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022). For this reason, no segmental financial information as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2021 is presented under “Summary—Summary Financial Information and Other Data,” nor is such
financial information discussed in this section.

**_2022 Discontinued operations_**

During the year ended December 31, 2022, the results of operations of the Group were affected by the military invasion
of Ukraine by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, as a result of which we decided to discontinue our business
activities in Russia and launched a plan to sell these companies that comprised the “Russian” market segment. These
circumstances were presented as discontinued business operations in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022. In accordance with the accounting legislation in force, the Group was required to change the
comparative figures in the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2021, recognize the net result after
tax of the discontinued business unit in a single amount, change the comparative figures of the consolidated statement of cash
flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 and report the net change in cash and cash equivalents arising from the
discontinued business activities in a single amount. However, since the effects of this reporting were immaterial with respect
to the consolidated financial statements as a whole, we decided to maintain the presentation of the income and expenses, and
cash inflows and outflows, of these subsidiaries in 2021, in accordance with their nature, and as they were recognized in the
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 without restating them. As a result, the financial
information presented in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2022 is therefore not directly comparable to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement
of cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Principal Income Statement Account Items**

The following is a brief description of the principal revenue and expenses that are included in the line items of our
consolidated income statement accounts.

**_Net turnover_**

Net turnover is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and represents the amounts received or
receivable for the goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, value added tax and other
recoverable sales-related taxes. Where it is doubtful as to whether the revenues will be collected, recognition is deferred until
they are effectively collected. Net turnover includes revenue on sales of products and ordinary revenue from the provision of
services.

**_Changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress_**

We value our inventories as follows:

Materials and other supplies, packaging and containers, replacement parts, sundry materials, add-on parts and stocks
for resale, are valued at the lower of cost applying the weighted average price method and net realizable value.

Finished goods, semi-finished goods and works-in-progress are stated at the lower of real average production cost
(materials used, labor and direct and indirect manufacturing expenses) and net realizable value.

Tools for new projects, which are developed and manufactured by us to be sold later on to our customers, are stated
at the lower of either the costs incurred to manufacture them, as and when they are incurred, and their estimated net realizable
value.

Net realizable value corresponds to the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completing the products and
the costs to be incurred in the marketing, selling and distribution.

Obsolete, defective or slow-moving inventories are reduced to their realizable value. In addition, if the net realizable
value of the inventories is lower than the acquisition or production cost, the appropriate write-downs are recognized as an
expense in the consolidated income statement for the year.

70


-----

**_Capital grants and other grants taken to income_**

Official grants related to property, plant and equipment are recognized in our consolidated statements of financial
position as deferred income when we have met the relevant qualifying conditions and there are, therefore, no reasonable doubts
about the grants being collected. These capital grants are taken to the consolidated income statement under “Capital grants and
other grants taken to income” on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets.

Grants to cover or finance our expenses are recognized once all the conditions attaching to them have been fulfilled
and will be taken to income when the financed expenses are incurred.

**_Other operating revenue_**

Other operating revenue is comprised primarily of revenues on the sale of project tools, income from miscellaneous
services, operating grants, income from leases of investment property, revenues from the assignment of industrial property and
other revenue.

**_Supplies_**

The amount of supplies that are used in the production process are reported in the consolidated income statement. The
most significant item accounted as supply is the purchase of materials. Changes during the period in inventories of materials,
goods for resale and other supplies are adjusted in the supplies account.

**_Staff costs_**

Our staff costs include wages, salaries and similar expenses, termination benefits, employer’s social security
contributions and other welfare expenses. Staff costs are primarily driven by the size of our operations, our geographical reach
and customer requirements.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges_**

Depreciation and amortization charges relate mainly to the annual depreciation charges on property, plant, equipment
and capitalized development expenses. We transfer property, plant and equipment under construction to property, plant and
equipment used in operations when the assets in question become operational, from which time depreciation is charged.
Property, plant and equipment used in operations are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on the acquisition or production
cost of the assets or their restated value, less their residual value. The land on which buildings and other constructions are
located is deemed to have an indefinite lifespan and is therefore not subject to depreciation. Annual depreciation charges on
property, plant and equipment are charged to “Depreciation and amortization charges” in the consolidated income statement
over the average estimated useful life of the assets. Capitalized development expenses are generally amortized on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the projects as from the date the related projects are completed.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Our other operating expenses relate to the rental cost of leased buildings, maintenance and upkeep, other external
services, taxes and levies, impairment of accounts receivable and application of non-current provisions.

**_Financial profit(loss)/Financial loss_**

Financial profit(loss)/Financial loss primarily consists of finance income, finance expenses, net fair value
gains/(losses) on financial instruments, exchange differences and impairment and gains/(losses) on disposal of financial
instruments.

**_Profit before taxes_**

Profit before taxes includes net impairment losses on non-current assets, profits or losses from disposal of assets,
gains/(losses) on disposal of non-current assets, profits from business combinations and profit of companies accounted for
using the equity method.

**_Corporate income tax_**

The Company and all of its consolidated Spanish subsidiaries domiciled in Spanish “common territory” in which it
has holdings of 75% or more file consolidated corporation tax returns.

The income tax expense is calculated as the tax payable with respect to the taxable profit for the year, after considering
any changes in the assets and liabilities recognized arising from temporary differences and from tax credit and tax loss carry
forwards.

We consider that a timing difference exists when there is a difference between the carrying amount of an asset or
liability and its tax base. The tax base for assets and liabilities is treated as the amount attributed to it for tax purposes. A taxable
timing difference is understood to be a difference that will generate a future obligation for us to pay taxes to the related tax
authorities. A deductible timing difference is one that will generate a right for us to a refund or to make a lower payment to the
related tax authorities in the future.

Tax credits and deductions and tax loss carry forwards are amounts that, after performance of the activity or
obtainment of the profit or loss giving entitlement to them, are not used for tax purposes in the related tax return until the
conditions for doing so established in tax regulations are met, provided that we consider it probable that they will be used in
future periods.

Current tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the related tax
authorities within twelve months from the date they are recognized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are
expected to be recoverable from or payable to the related tax authorities in future years.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. In this regard, a deferred tax liability is
recognized for the taxable timing differences resulting from investments in subsidiary companies and associate companies, and
from holdings in joint ventures, except when we can control the reversal of the timing differences and they are not expected to
be reversed in the foreseeable future.

The consolidated companies only recognize deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and
from tax credit and tax loss carry forwards to the extent that it is probable that they will have sufficient future taxable profits
against which these assets can be utilized.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability
(other than in a business combination) that at the time of recognition affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. The
deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized are reassessed each year in order to ascertain whether they still exist, and the
appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed.

**_Consolidated profit attributable to non-controlling interests_**

Our consolidated results include entities in which we have a non-controlling interest. See note 12 to our Audited
Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, for a
description of the entities in which we had a non-controlling interest during the period.

**Principal Segmental Account Items**

**_Net turnover_**

Net turnover refers to the incomes related to the sale of components and the services provided to OEMs in the normal
course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other recoverable sales-related taxes.

**_Other operating (expenses)/ income, net_**

Other operating (expenses)/income, net refers to and includes all expenses necessary to produce the goods sold and
the services provided to our customers, excluding financial expenses, impairments on assets and results coming from asset
disposals.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges_**

Refers to the amount recognized in our income statement under this concept reflecting the loss of value of the tangible
and intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.

**_Net turnover_**

Net turnover decreased by €117.2 million, or 10.1%, from €1,156.5 million for the three months ended March 31,
2023 to €1,039.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to (i) the negative impact
of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the euro determined on a constant currency basis (which amounted to €11.3
million), (ii) a change in our consolidation perimeter pursuant to the sale of our Austrian facility in November 2023, which
facility accounted for €36 million of net turnover during the three months ended March 31, 2023, (iii) production delays of our
electric vehicles programs which were substituting ending combustion line production, and (vi) certain projects reaching their
end, with expected replacement projects to begin only in 2025. Specifically, net turnover for the three months ended March 31,
2024 decreased in Europe & ROW by 10.4%, or €62.6 million (primarily due to a weak market in Germany, Slovakia and
Austria), in North America by 13.6%, or €50.7 million (primarily due to foreign exchange variations and the end of certain
projects) and in Asia by 2.5%, or €4.4 million. The decrease in net turnover in Asia for the three months ended March 31, 2024
was primarily caused by the impact of foreign exchange variations, without which net turnover in the region would have
increased by 3% during the period on a constant currency basis, and was partially offset by a higher net turnover in India.

**_Supplies_**

Supplies decreased by €94.3 million, or 12.3%, from €768.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to
€674.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to lower net turnover during the
three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, and supply chain initiatives linked
to our strategic plan for the 2023-2026 period, including renegotiations with top suppliers and supplier’s portfolio optimization.
Supply cost as percentage of total net turnover decreased from 66.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to 64.9% for
the three months ended March 31, 2024.

**_Staff costs_**

Staff costs decreased by €16.4 million, or 7.0%, from €233.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to
€216.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the lower net turnover during
the period, and our smaller workforce resulting from certain rightsizing initiatives undertaken in connection with our strategic
plan.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges_**

Depreciation and amortization charges decreased by €0.4 million, or 0.7%, from €60.4 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 to €60.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses decreased by €36.5 million, or 21.7%, from €168.4 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 to €131.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to the lower
net turnover during the period, as well as lower external direct workforce utilities expenses in connection therewith, and a
decrease in advisory and association services and travelling expenses resulting from our strategic plan.

**_Profit/(loss) from ordinary continuing operations_**

Profit from ordinary continuing operations increased by €13.9 million, from €8.9 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 to €22.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the reasons
stated above.

**_Financial loss_**

Financial loss increased by €6.8 million, or 43.6%, from €15.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to
€22.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates (€1.7 million) and our higher interest expense (€4.9 million) during the period, due to an increase in our financial debt.

**_Corporate income tax_**

Corporate income tax decreased by €3.8 million, or 97.4%, from an expense of €4.0 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 to an expense of €0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.

**_Consolidated profit/(loss) for the period_**

Consolidated profit for the period increased by €10.3 million, from a loss of €10.2 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 to a profit of €0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to the
reasons stated above.

March 31, 2023 to €940.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to certain
projects in North America reaching their completion, the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the euro,
changes in our consolidation perimeter in Austria and the effect of certain non-recurring items such as the halting of the
operations of two facilities in Mexico because of lower demand in the region as well as a customer facility strike, and several
interruptions of our facilities in North America.

_Other operating (expenses)/income, net. Net operating expenses decreased by €132.3 million, or 13.4%, from €986.7_
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €854.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This decrease
was primarily due to the initiatives implemented in connection with our strategic plan for the 2023-2026 period, including
renegotiations with top suppliers and supplier’s portfolio optimization, which successfully reduced our cost base for the period,
as well as lower volumes.

_Management segment EBITDA. Management segment EBITDA increased by €5.8 million, or 7.2%, from €80.4_
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 to €86.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This increase
was primarily due to the reduction of our cost base as a result of our strategic plan for the 2023-2026 period, partially offset by
lower sales.

**_Net turnover_**

Net turnover increased by €166.5 million, or 3.7% (or 5.3% on a constant currency basis), to €4,617.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2023 from €4,450.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net turnover was
primarily attributable to positive macroeconomic trends in the automotive industry, which resulted in strong demand for cars
in almost all of our geographical areas and a production volume of 86.6 million units for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Our strong production volumes led to increases in net turnover in Europe & ROW (6.3%, or €135.8 million) and, to a lesser
extent, in Asia (3.3%, or €24 million) and North America (0.4%, or €6.6 million). The net turnover increase in Europe & ROW
was primarily attributable to the aforementioned higher production volumes, as well as new programmes launched in Spain
(representing a 22% increase in net turnover), Turkey (representing a 37% increase in net turnover), Czech Republic
(representing a 15% increase in net turnover), Portugal (representing a 23% increase in net turnover), Slovakia (representing a
20% increase in net turnover) and France (representing a 12% increase in net turnover).

**_Supplies_**

Supplies increased by €100.5 million, or 3.4%, to €3,076.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from
€2,976.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in supplies was primarily attributable to higher net
turnover during the period. Supply cost as percentage of total net turnover decreased from 66.9% for the year ended December
31, 2022 to 66.6% for the year ended December 31, 2023.

**_Staff costs_**

Staff costs increased by €13.9 million, or 1.6%, to €890.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from
€876.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries and wages
(€681.4 million), employers’ social security contributions (€167.3 million) and other employee benefit expenses (€35.3 million)
paid during the period.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges_**

Depreciation and amortization charges decreased by €45.1 million, or 16.1%, to €235.8 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023 from €280.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in depreciation and amortization
charges was primarily due to a €151.6 million impairment charge recorded in 2022.

**_Other operating expenses_**

Other operating expenses increased by €23.1 million, or 4.1%, to €584.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2023 from €561.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in other operating expenses was mainly
attributable to higher expenses in connection with leases, repairs and maintenance, independent professional services, transport,
insurance premiums, advertising, publicity and public relation and utilities, partially offset by lower expenses in connection
with R&D and banking and similar services.

**_Profit from ordinary continuing operations_**

Profit from ordinary continuing operations increased by €76.2 million to €92.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023 from €16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to the reasons
stated above.

**_Financial loss_**

Financial loss increased by €24.1 million, or 62%, to €63.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from
€38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net finance cost was primarily attributable to higher
financial expenses resulting from higher interest and the impact thereof on our indebtedness that bears interest at a floating
rate, as well as increased levels of non-recourse factoring during the year ended December 31, 2023 (€193 million).

**_Corporate income tax_**

Corporate income tax decreased by €30.8 million, or 285.2%, to a credit of €20 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023 compared to an obligation of €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 . The decrease was
primarily attributable to the capitalization of tax credits from prior years and other deferred taxes.

**_Consolidated profit for the year_**

Consolidated profit for the year increased by €223.6 million, to a profit of €12.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023 from a loss of €211 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the
reasons stated above.

& Hard Trim and Instrument Panels and Central Consoles divisions, partially offset by lower sales in our Headliners division.
Our Product Systems net turnover increase for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily linked to local increases in
South Africa, Turkey, Vietnam, Hungary, Thailand, Portugal, Spain and Slovakia as well as customer compensations achieved
by our commercial department in order to recover inflation-related costs from 2022.

_Other operating (expenses)/income, net. Net operating expenses increased by €92.2 million, or 2.5%, to €3,817.4_
million for the year ended December 31, 2023, from €3,725.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was
primarily due to higher sales and expenses incurred in order to implement cost control initiatives during the period, and was
partially offset by the savings related to the cost control initiatives discussed above.

€4,055.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in net turnover was primarily attributable to a gradual
recovery in the overall macroeconomic background during the second half of 2022 and the resulting demand in the automotive
industry. Net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2022 generally grew across all of our key geographies, other than
Europe, where we recorded a 0.7% decrease in net turnover, primarily caused by the lower production volumes in England
(with a 20% decrease) and the discontinuation of our operations in Russia during the period. The most significant increases in
net turnover by customer were recorded in relation to the Stellantis Group, General Motors, Ford and Hyundai. On the other
hand, the most significant decrease in net turnover was that relating to BMW, as a result of the sale of Antolin Spartanburg
Assembly, Inc. in the United States, most of whose production was dedicated to this customer.

**_Supplies_**

Supplies increased by €308.2 million, or 11.6%, to €2,976.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from
€2,668.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in supplies was primarily attributable to higher net
turnover and inflation during the period. Supply cost as percentage of total net turnover increased from 65.8% for the year
ended December 31, 2021 to 66.9% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

**_Staff costs_**

Staff costs increased by €48.4 million, or 5.8%, to €876.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from
€828.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher salaries and wages
(€669.8 million), employers’ social security contributions (€170.3 million) and termination benefits (€5.0 million) paid during
the period, partially offset by our lower number of employees during the period.

**_Depreciation and amortization charges_**

Depreciation and amortization charges increased by €1.0 million, or 0.4%, to €280.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 from €279.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

2022 from €498.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in other operating expenses was mainly
attributable to higher expenses in connection with R&D, repairs and maintenance, independent professional services, transport,
insurance premiums, advertising and utilities, partially offset by lower expenses in connection with leases.

**_Profit/(loss) from ordinary continuing operations_**

Profit from ordinary continuing operations increased by €14.5 million to €16.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022 from €1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in profit from ordinary continuing
operations was primarily due to the reasons stated above.

**_Financial profit(loss)_**

Financial profit/(loss) decreased by €7.9 million, or 16.9%, to €38.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
from €46.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in net finance cost was primarily attributable to
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and higher financial income as a result of capital gains in connection with the €9.7 million
open market buyback of the 2028 Notes by the Company in July 2022.

**_Corporate income tax_**

Corporate income tax increased by €2.3 million, or 27.1%, to €10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022
compared to €8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Consolidated profit/(loss) for the year_**

Notes and the 2028 Notes.

Our total net cash used in financing activities was €78.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily
attributable to €65.8 million payments of leases associated with right-of-use assets, €15.7 million of scheduled repayments
related to Senior Facilities and the payment of interests on our other sources of indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes and the
2028 Notes. In addition, we also made a €6.3 million dividend payment to our shareholders.

Our total net cash used in financing activities was €168.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily
attributable to €70.3 million payments of leases associated with right-of-use assets, €16.1 million of scheduled repayments
related to Senior Facilities, €15.9 million of net payment of our other bank borrowings and the payment of interest (€47.2
million) on our other sources of indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes. In addition, in July 2022, we
purchased an aggregate principal amount of €9.7 million of the 2028 Notes pursuant to an open market transaction in July
2022.

Our total net cash used in financing activities was €144.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily
attributable to the redemption of our senior secured notes due 2024 (€385.0 million), payments of leases associated with rightof-use assets (€66.7 million), scheduled repayments related to the Senior Facilities (€11.6 million), the payment of interests
(€42.4 million) on our other sources of indebtedness, including the 2026 Notes and the 2028 Notes, and the payment of
dividends (€12.0 million), all of which were partially offset by the 2028 Notes.

**Liquidity**

Our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow, which is analysed above. Our ability to generate cash
from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general
economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other
factors. Additionally, for liquidity management, our goal is to maintain flexible financing, through the availability of contracted
credit facilities or factoring lines with or without recourse (through which we transfer our receivables to third parties).

As of March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to €240.8 million. Additionally, as of March 31, 2024,
we had available revolving credit facilities totaling €127.8 million, which consisted of €59.1 million under our Revolving
Credit Facility (with €130.0 million thereunder drawn as of the same date) and €68.7 million under other credit lines (with
€16.6 million thereunder drawn as of the same date).

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings and cash on
hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will
generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include:

    - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of operating profit from our operations, which could be
caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole;

    - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us;

85


-----

    - a failure to maintain low working capital requirements; and

    - the need to fund expansion and other development capital expenditures.

Our “free cash flow” is calculated by deducting from our total net cash flows from operating activities our capital
expenditures (which represent expenditures in property plant and equipment, plus expenditures in intangible assets). For the
three months ended March 31, 2024, our “free cash flow” amounted to €37.1 million, compared to €14.3 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, “free cash flow” amounted to €43.1 million, compared
to €15.7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. See “—Capital Expenditures.”

**For the year ended** **For the three months**
**December 31,** **ended March 31**

**2022** **2023** **2023** **2024**
_(in € millions)_
**Summary Free Cash Flow:**
Total net cash flows from operating activities....................................................................................................................... 216.0 296.1 44.5 (15.4)
Capital expenditures .............................................................................................................................................................. (200.3) (253.0) (58.8) (52.5)
**Free Cash Flow.....................................................................................................................................................................** **(15.7)** **(43.1)** **(14.3)** **(37.1)**

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under our current or any
future credit facility) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - sell our assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory
terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing indebtedness and any future debt may limit our ability to pursue any of
these alternatives.

As any other company that operates in our industry, we are leveraged and have debt service obligations. As of
March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had loans and borrowings in an aggregate amount of
€1,494.8 million outstanding, consisting primarily of the Notes, the 2028 Notes, loans under the Senior Facility Agreement,
outstanding borrowings under the EIB Facilities and outstanding borrowings under the COFIDES Facility.

**(77.8)** **(79.3)** **(111.6)**
**210.2** **(62.7)** **(63.9)**

Our working capital requirements largely arise from our trade receivables, which are primarily composed of amounts
owed to us by our customers, inventories primarily composed of materials (mainly textile fabric, plastic injection grain and
petroleum-based resins) and other current assets which comprise receivables accounts with the public treasury by the advanced
payments of taxes or refunds of taxes. Our trade payables primarily relate to trade payables to our suppliers for materials,
services and fixed assets, other amounts to the public treasury for taxes and payments to our employees by way of salaries. We
have historically funded our working capital requirements through funds generated from our operations, from borrowings under
bank facilities and through funds from other finance sources.

Our working capital requirements are mainly related to our inventories as the degree of vertical integration in our
company is high.

We anticipate that our working capital requirements in the foreseeable future will generally be stable as a percentage
of net turnover. However, these requirements can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including any significant increase
in receivables due to longer time periods to collect payment from our customers or a substantial increase in the cost of our
materials.

judgment in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. Actual results could differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. For a detailed description of our critical accounting policies, see note 3 to our Audited
Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2023 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

88


-----

**Market Risks**

Our activities are exposed to a number of financial risks: market risk (fair value risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity
risk, exchange risk and interest-rate risk on cash flows. Our global risk management program is focused on the uncertainty of
financial markets and seeks to minimize potential adverse effects on our financial performance. We use financial derivatives
to hedge against certain risks. Risk management is controlled by our financial department in accordance with policies approved
by our board of directors. Our financial department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with
our operating units. Our board of directors determines policies for the global management of risk, and for specific risk areas
such as currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, risk derived from the use of derivative and non-derivative financial
instruments and the investment of cash surpluses.

We are exposed to the risk of changes in market value of the investments held as “available for sale” which are
classified under “non-current financial assets” in the consolidated statements of financial position.

The risk deriving from a possible increase in the prices of materials, including the purchase of components used in the
production processes, is mitigated by the fact that we operate with our main suppliers under long-term agreements which afford
stability in prices. On the other hand, we negotiate with our customers to pass on increases in the prices of certain materials.
The terms of agreements with customers have resulted in lower prices, which could reduce our margins. We nevertheless
develop improvement programs and tools to offset these decreases with increases in productivity. We also negotiate with our
suppliers to help them absorb these price reductions.

**_Commodity risk_**

The primary materials used in our production facilities are textile fabrics, plastic injection grain, petroleum-based
resins and certain metals, like copper. We are mostly neutral to changes in the price of materials as a result of our pass-through
arrangements with OEMs, which function as a hedge of our material costs.

**_Credit risk_**

Our customer portfolio is diversified across the major vehicle manufacturing groups, as a result of which there is no
particular concentration of credit risk. In the past, motor vehicle manufacturers were deemed not to have a major credit risk.
We therefore consider that, in spite of the difficulties facing the motor vehicle sector, the credit ratings of its debtors are sound,
and its receivables will be collectable as normal. We have policies for other customers to ensure that they in turn sell to
customers who have suitable credit histories.

The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents, financial derivatives and deposits with banks and financial institutions
is deemed to be immaterial, as these operations are only entered into with financial institutions with high credit ratings. We
have policies for limiting the amount of the risk with any financial institution.

**_Liquidity risk_**

We manage liquidity risk prudently, based on maintaining sufficient cash and negotiable securities, the availability of
funding by means of sufficient committed credit facilities and the capacity to liquidate positions in the market. Furthermore,
the centralized cash pooling system we have set up allows us to manage financial resources with greater efficiency. Given the
dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, our financial department aims to keep financing flexible through its use of the
Senior Facilities.

**_Interest rate risks for cash flows and fair value risk_**

Given that we do not carry major amounts of interest-earning assets, our operating revenues and cash flows are fairly
independent of the variations in market interest rates. Our interest rate risk stems from our non-current borrowings. Our fixed
rate borrowings expose us to fair value interest rate risks. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 60% of our borrowings
were at fixed interest rates (52% including non-recourse factoring). As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, we had no derivative
instruments contracted to cover our exposure to variable interest rates. Taking into account the contractual terms of the funding
in force at that date, it was estimated that a 0.50% change in interest rates would lead to a fluctuation of approximately €3
million in interest expenses.

89


-----

**_Foreign currency risks_**

Our international expansion and our ever-growing volume of business outside the Eurozone expose us to exchange rate risks
in currencies such as the Czech crown, the UK pound, the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar or the Mexican peso, which could
have an impact on our results. To reduce our exposure to this risk, we avail ourselves of a variety of mechanisms, such as
using local suppliers and negotiating with customers and suppliers to hedge against major movements in currencies.

**Introduction**

The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells and services motor vehicles which are usually
classified into either (i) light vehicles or (ii) heavy commercial vehicles. The light vehicle segment of the automotive industry
is comprised of passenger cars, vans and light trucks with a gross vehicle weight of less than six tons, while the heavy
commercial vehicle segment of the automotive industry consists of vehicles with a gross vehicle weight six tons or more.

The automotive production value chain is split between OEMs such as Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan and Ford
and automotive suppliers, such as Bosch, Continental, Magna and Antolin. Automotive suppliers are then generally further
categorized into three different tiers as follows:

    - _Tier 1: these suppliers, such as Antolin, sell their products directly to OEMs. Typically, these products are larger_
modules or systems which integrate components, sometimes sourced from Tier 2 automotive suppliers.

    - _Tier 2: they provide individual components or component groups._

    - _Tier 3: in turn, a further layer of Tier 3 suppliers produces individual parts which are typically integrated by Tier_
2 suppliers.

A clear delineation of the suppliers as Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 is not always possible because suppliers often
manufacture and sell numerous products or product groups.

Automotive suppliers are typically further divided into sub-segments based on their components’ function within
vehicles. Each of these sub-segments is comprised of various product groups. A typical classification of automotive suppliers
by vehicle function could include the following sub-segments: powertrain, body and structural, electronics, interior,
transmission, suspension, climate control, wheels and tires, steering, fuel systems, passenger restraints, audio and telematics,
exhaust and body glass. There are many different market leaders in the respective market niches. Consequently, a consistent
definition of these niche markets rarely exists and it is very difficult to determine the market position of an individual supplier
using objective criteria.

As an automotive supplier of interior components, our net turnover is linked to the development of automotive
production numbers and changes in the content per vehicle for the components we produce.

**Overview of and Key Trends in the Interior Components Market**

We mainly act as a supplier to OEMs in the interior components market. The interior market comprises all the products
and components that form the cabin interior of a vehicle and surround its driver and passengers. As such, interior components
have a direct effect on driver and passenger comfort and safety and are therefore important components that allow OEMs to
differentiate between vehicle models. Products in this category typically include, among others, instrument panels, arm and
head rests, headliners, door panels, carpeting and floor covers, glove boxes, sun visors, interior panels, power controls, ashtrays,
air outlets, handles, sound deadeners and horn pads.

-----

Key trends in the interior component market include higher consumer expectations of interior comfort, and demand
for a higher standard of vehicle interior content. Interior styling is the one of the most important purchasing factors influencing
vehicle selection. The trend towards higher consumer expectations of interior content increases demand for features such as
improved fit, finish, craftsmanship and more recently, sustainability in interiors across all vehicle types. We believe OEMs are
dedicating a larger portion of their total spend per vehicle to interior components as they “upscale” vehicle interiors in order to
adapt to this trend across their entire portfolio of platforms, from compact to sports utility vehicles to luxury vehicles. Suppliers
with advanced design, materials and manufacturing capabilities to deliver a broad suite of interior component products across
a wide range of price points should benefit from this continued focus on interior comfort and craftsmanship by both consumers
and OEMs.

Additionally, OEMs are driven by regulatory changes and consumer preferences to invest heavily in environmental
initiatives such as fuel efficiency, reduced emissions and overall environmental friendliness, including recycling. See “—
_Market and Industry Trend.” This creates a need for interior components that are lighter-weight, have improved acoustical_
performance and are environmentally friendly, and will continue to provide an opportunity for differentiation for interior
component supplier as OEMs strive to reduce the ecological footprint of their vehicles.

The automotive interior market has undergone substantial changes over recent years. Following the financial crisis in
2008 and 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, vehicle production significantly decreased, which detrimentally
affected the financial condition of many OEMs and, consequently, many automotive suppliers. Supply chain disruptions
followed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and were further exacerbated by the military invasion of Ukraine by the
Russian Federation in February 2022, which in turn accelerated surging commodity prices and general inflationary pressures.
In addition to this, labor shortages, sustained inflation and rising interest rates, as well as an ongoing shift in the powertrain
and digitalization technologies within automotive engineering, have added to the increased pressure faced by automotive
suppliers. As a result, OEMs, especially the challengers in China, have emerged as stalwarts with sustained growth in
production and growing demand driven by cost advantages and improved production quality.

**Market and Industry Trends**

The global automotive supplier market is characterized by the following trends and growth factors:

**_The market share of low-cost and premium automotive segments are expected to increase at the expense of the_**
**_mid-market volume segment_**

In the long-term, the automotive market is expected to continue to shift focus away from mid-market towards low-tech
and low-cost vehicles on the one hand and function oriented, innovative vehicles for premium customers on the other hand. In
recent years, the market share of low-cost passenger cars has been increasing, predominantly in China, India, Brazil and Eastern
Europe, and sales of small passenger cars are expected to grow further. These cars are mainly manufactured and sold in
high-growth countries in APAC, as well as in Brazil and Eastern Europe. Growth in the premium segment is also expected to
be driven by emerging markets, including China, India and Africa. Vehicles in the premium segment tend to be more
technologically advanced in each sub-segment of automotive components, including the interior components segment.

**_Stricter carbon dioxide emission regulations and other regulatory and demand drivers worldwide are forcing_**
**_OEMs to improve fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness of vehicles_**

The development and production of more fuel-efficient vehicles is a key growth trend in the automotive sector. Such
trend is driven by consumers’ preference to save money on fuel and regulatory factors. Furthermore, sustainability has become
a strategic priority for the automotive industry. Increasing social and environmental awareness among end consumers is
expected to play a greater role in vehicle purchase decisions. Consequently, OEMs face ongoing pressure to improve the fuel
efficiency of their vehicles and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The regulatory obligation to improve the efficiency
of existing technologies and to develop new environmentally friendly technologies aimed at reducing fuel consumption and
carbon dioxide emissions is becoming a key focus for OEMs, given stringent carbon dioxide consumption and emission
standards throughout the industrial world, including in Europe, the United States, China and Japan.

92


-----

The development and production of innovative components and systems contributing to emission reduction is a key
growth area in the automotive sector. Many countries have adopted emission regulations which set limits on the amount of
pollutants that new vehicles can emit. These regulations limit, among others, the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides,
hydrocarbons and particulate matter, all of which are considered harmful to human health. Within the next several years,
emission limits worldwide are expected to become increasingly restrictive given growing environmental awareness.
Regulations have been adopted in both developed and emerging markets. For instance, Brazil, India and China tend to adopt
similar regulations a few years after such regulations have been approved in Europe. The emission limits for nitrogen oxides
and particulate matters emitted by diesel vehicles are expected to face the most substantial reductions. In the European Union,
for example, the regulatory standard Euro 6, which became compulsory for all new passenger cars in 2015, reduced the
emission limit of nitrogen oxides for diesel vehicles from 180 mg/km today to 80 mg/km. Passenger car carbon dioxide
regulation limits are expected to decrease from 130 g/km in 2015 to approximately 50 g/km between 2030 and 2034. The
tightening of emission regulation worldwide is expected to drive demand for more eco-friendly products, thereby forcing OEMs
and suppliers to develop innovative components and systems which comply with the more restrictive emission legislation. The
chart below shows the passenger car carbon dioxide regulation limits between 2020 and 2024 and expectations between 2025
and 2034:

**_Increasing number of electric and hybrid cars as sustainable vehicles are the future of transportation_**

Consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious, which is affecting their vehicle purchase choice.
The production of electric and hybrid vehicles has increased, with hybrid vehicles being more popular than purely electric
vehicles. Despite the fact that the rates of adoption of these vehicles has, to date, been relatively slow (largely due to their
relatively high price and, with respect to purely electric vehicles, short driving range and the lack of battery re-charging
infrastructure) in the last few years, a significant transformation has occurred in the motor vehicle landscape. Electric cars,
which used to be a fringe choice in a market otherwise dominated by major global automakers, are rapidly becoming
mainstream. Several start-ups are currently developing electric vehicle offerings driven by rising environmental consciousness,
as well as subsidies from local and national governments which are offering various forms of rebates and credits for the purchase
of an electric vehicle, and have also begun to support the rise of e-mobility by accelerating the push for zero emission vehicles
due to increased awareness of the impacts of global warming. The chart below shows the evolution of global electrified stock
from 2019 to 2023, during which global electrified stock grew globally at a CAGR of 54% overall:

Notwithstanding the above, it is expected to be a number of years before battery technology is sufficiently improved
and becomes affordable for mainstream use in automobiles. Moreover, it is expected that it will also take time to develop
charging stations to support these types of vehicles. Once these obstacles have been overcome, take up of both hybrid and
electric cars is expected to further accelerate. At this stage, we are likely to see an increase in the number of automotive suppliers
who manufacture electric motors, advanced automotive batteries as well as semiconductors, connectors and sensors designed
for electrical vehicles. Furthermore, the transition from internal combustion engines to electric powertrains has resulted in
significant efforts to reduce the weight of vehicles. Sustainability considerations are also factors that drive up the importance
of lightweight materials in the automotive industry. Therefore, manufacturers are forced to compensate for the increase in
weight of power systems by reducing the weight of other subsystems such as interiors, body and chassis, and suspension,
among others.

**_The move to common, global platforms provides strong opportunities for global suppliers, while increasing the_**
**_pressure to globalize further_**

OEMs are increasingly designing vehicle models built on common but variable platforms which can be produced in
high volumes. The use of common platforms allows OEMs to increase economies of scale across their value chain, differentiate
their products from those of their competitors, expand the number of product segments in which they compete, extend the life
of existing automobile platforms and remain responsive to rapidly evolving lifestyle trends and customer preferences. This
trend towards common platforms provides automotive suppliers, such as Antolin, increased opportunities to supply larger
volumes of products and to benefit from economies of scale. Furthermore, there is an increased dependency on suppliers
capable of managing complex projects, which in turn assures the quality standards globally.

**_There is strong consolidation pressure among global suppliers driven by evolving OEM requirements_**

In order to take advantage of the operational economies of scale across the value chain, OEMs are encouraging
consolidation of their supplier-base with an increased focus on large, technically and financially robust global suppliers capable
of producing consistent and high-quality products across geographies. The OEMs we supply use a number of factors to choose
their suppliers including, among others, quality, service (including location, service interruptions and on-time delivery),
in-house R&D and technological capabilities, overall track record and quality of relationship with the OEM, production
capacity, financial stability and price. Development expertise, an extensive geographical footprint, consistent and high quality
production capabilities and diverse ancillary competencies tend to offset price-sensitivities among OEMs, who appreciate the
added-value inherent in these other factors.

**_The regional shift of the automotive industry is expected to continue to intensify with the continuing increase in_**
**_demand for vehicles in emerging markets_**

While vehicle production demand has fluctuated across the global economy in recent years, particularly at the height
of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, as well as during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, on a normalized
level, the demand in emerging economies has generally continued to increase. Industry sources forecast that in the years leading
up to 2028, there will be a higher CAGR of sales in large and highly populated countries such as India, as well as in other
emerging economies, compared to Western Europe in general. In response to this trend, OEMs continue to develop their
presence in these markets, resulting in an increased need for OEMs to establish supplier networks beyond their home markets,
including the migration of component and vehicle design, development and engineering activities to certain of these markets.
In certain of these markets, such as China, there is already significant demand for new, premium brand vehicle models.
Nevertheless, vehicle demand in these emerging economies is predominantly for less advanced models with lower entry-level
price points. This increasing local demand of emerging markets has helped boost the local automotive industry in these
countries and has attracted investments in manufacturing from North American, European and APAC based automobile
manufacturers, through stand-alone investments and joint ventures with local partners. The evolution of volume demand in
these markets is happening at the same time as an evolution of regulatory and industry standards modelled after those set earlier
by more mature economies. This trend offers automobile suppliers such as Antolin an opportunity to expand their business
with their customers in these emerging markets.

**_Increased outsourcing by OEMs is driving a closer relationship with a selected group of suppliers that are acting_**
**_as development partners_**

As OEMs increasingly focus their resources on automobile assembly, they are either maintaining or increasing the
levels of production outsourcing to suppliers such as ourselves. As OEMs grow outside of their home markets, they are more
inclined to turn to external suppliers for content they might have done in-house. Suppliers such as Antolin can benefit from
economies of scale derived from serving various customers that OEM customers find more difficult to achieve in our product
segment when manufacturing abroad. In addition, specialization within automobile assembly has led to advances achieved by
suppliers in certain technologies, which OEMs find difficult to match in-house in price and quality, thereby increasing
outsourcing in these areas, even in mature economies. Furthermore, while know-how is still being developed by suppliers and
the design process remains controlled by OEMs, the collaboration with Tier 1 suppliers is becoming increasingly important.

**_OEMs and suppliers increasingly pursue cooperative agreements to achieve scale quickly_**

In order to achieve economies of scale and defray developments costs, competing automobile component
manufacturers are increasingly entering into cooperative alliances and arrangements relating to shared purchasing of
components, joint engine, powertrain and/or platform development and sharing and other forms of cooperation. This
cooperation among competing automobile component manufacturers is expected to continue.

**Automotive production development by region**

Following the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, automotive production worldwide steadily grew from
74.3 million vehicles in 2010 to 89.3 million vehicles in 2019, representing a CAGR of 2.1%. In 2020, global production
decreased by 13.7% due to the COVID-19 pandemic that halted production globally. Supply chain disruptions followed the
COVID-19 pandemic and were further exacerbated by the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation in February
2022, which in turn accelerated surging commodity prices and general inflationary pressures. Additionally, labor shortages,
sustained inflation and rising interest rates, in addition to an ongoing shift in the powertrain and digitalization technologies
within automotive engineering, have added to the increased pressure faced by automobile suppliers. By 2025, global automotive
production is expected to grow to 92.5 million vehicles, representing a CAGR of 3.7% between 2021 and 2025. We provide
below a brief description of selected historical and forecast light vehicle production in key regions in which we operate, as well
as selected annualized growth rates in production. Both historical and forecast data is based on data published by an independent
third party provider. The chart below shows the evolution of global light vehicle production volume by region between 2019
and 2025 in million units:

**_Asia_**

The key automotive manufacturing countries in Asia are China, followed by India, Japan, and South Korea. Overall,
the recent challenges experienced by the broader automotive industry have had a limited impact on the region, with Chinese
manufacturing volumes remaining strong.

95


-----

As a key automotive growth market, China has also become a key growth market for a number of local and
international OEMs and suppliers, with many establishing production facilities in the country. As a result, automotive
production in China grew at a CAGR of 2.1% between 2020 and 2023 (from 23.7 million vehicles in 2020 to 25.2 million
vehicles in 2023), and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.4% between 2023 and 2025, reaching 26.4 million vehicles.

Automotive production in Asia (excluding China) grew from 13.3 million vehicles in 2020 to 16.5 million vehicles in
2023, representing a CAGR of 7.5%. Driven by growth in India with a slight slowdown expected from South Korea and Japan,
automotive production across Asia (excluding China) is expected to grow steadily to 17.4 million vehicles by 2025.

**_North America_**

North American automotive production volumes rebounded from 17.0 million vehicles in 2020 to pre-COVID levels
at 18.6 million vehicles in 2023, representing a CAGR of 3.0% during the period. By 2025, automotive production in the region
is projected to grow to 19.8 million vehicles, driven primarily by fast growing European “transplants”, or localization of
European OEM production capabilities in North America, improved macroeconomic conditions, recent stability in the labor
market, easing financial market conditions, and solid household and business balance sheets.

**_Europe_**

European car production volumes are still lagging below pre-COVID levels, decreasing from 20.7 million vehicles in
2019 to 17.7 million vehicles in 2023, representing a negative CAGR of approximately 3.8% during the period. This gap is
expected to decrease to 19.4 million units by 2025, driven primarily by the stagnation of the Eurozone economy as a result of
contractionary monetary policy in the region, the impact of high inflation on consumers’ real income level, weak external
demand and an industrial recession.

due to the long lead-time and large investment required to set up the production and supply processes, and to the scale
operational efficiencies gained through experience with the lean manufacturing of certain products. We believe that such
switching costs, together with our technological capabilities, strongly protect our leading market position.

**_Highly diversified business model_**

_Regional diversification_

We have a geographically diversified platform of 118 manufacturing plants and JIT assembly and sequencing
facilities, as well as 26 TCOs across 25 countries as of December 31, 2023. We supplied our products around the world to over
100 different automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs in 2023. We provided components for more than 600
different vehicle models. Given the nature of our products, geographical and customer diversification allow us to take advantage
of global growth opportunities, in particular owing to our presence in Eastern Europe, North America, South America and Asia,
which in the past has mitigated the impact of regional production fluctuations on our business during periods of economic
downturn.

We are a truly global player who has committed substantial investment to, and has a well-established presence in,
growth markets. We believe we are a market leader measured by units of production in many of these markets, which gives us
a competitive advantage over other players. Furthermore, our net turnover from our Asia operations has increased from €82.2
million in 2010 to €756.1 million in 2023, representing 16.4% of our net turnover in 2023. Our Management EBITDA increased
by 19.5%, or €13.5 million, to €82.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from €69.3 million in the three months
ended March 31, 2023. Our Management segment EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included (i) €55.4
million attributable to Europe & ROW (compared to €50.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023), (ii) €23.5
million attributable to North America (compared to €23.5 million for the thee months ended March 31, 2023) and (iii) €26.0
million attributable to Asia (compared to €21.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023).

As part of our customer-focused approach to our expansion strategy, we have proactively coordinated our expansion
plans into growth markets with those OEMs to whom we supply. When an OEM customer expands into a new market or
location, we determine whether it is in our strategic interest to also open a facility in such location. Furthermore, our strong
geographical diversification allows us to take advantage of global growth opportunities and mitigates the impact of regional
demand fluctuations on our business during economic downturns. The following charts show the evolution of our geographical
net turnover breakdown between 2010 (€1,637 million) and 2023 (€4,617.4 million):

Geographical net turnover split in 2010 Geographical net turnover split in 2023

Our global presence enables us to manufacture, assemble and sequence our products in our plants and JIT facilities,
which are located close to OEMs around the world. This allows for JIT delivery systems on a global scale and on a consistent
and high-quality basis, making us a clear choice for global OEMs.

Our well-developed technological capabilities, global manufacturing footprint and proximity to OEMs, operational
scale and track record of financial performance enable us to supply products to support an OEM throughout the full product
life cycle. Additionally, we often act as a development partner during the initial stages of product development which allow us
to recommend and incorporate our products into potential designs well in advance of any formal orders from our OEM
customers. Our ability to support the development process of OEMs and work as an outsourcing partner to them all over the
world is a significant differentiator, in particular on new product solutions, and would take large investments and a long time
to replicate, thereby making us a preferred partner to the leading OEMs in the industry.

Our ability to maintain our competitive advantages and technological leadership has resulted in strong customer
relationships and translates into a consolidated customer base with our top five OEM customers representing 65.4% of net
turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023. The relationships with key customers are long-standing and the sales from our
top five OEM customers amounted to €3,019.8 million in 2023.

**_Attractive market fundamentals_**

According to different estimations from market data analysis and research providers, such as LMC, the global
automotive production industry is expected to increase by approximately 3.0% in 2024 to reach a production volume of up to
89.2 million of light vehicles. In terms of regions, Asia, North America and Europe were our largest markets as of December 31,
2023. The interior components market in which we operate is expected to outperform other sectors in the automotive industry
due to the increasing interior component content per vehicle. This trend is driven by growing comfort requirements of
consumers and rising technological demands from OEMs related to weight savings and noise and vibration insulation, as well
as the increase in electronics, functional and ambient lighting, smart surfaces, and on-demand technology compared to other
traditional automotive sectors.

We are in a strong position to continue to benefit from ongoing consolidation and supplier concentration in our market
due to our competitive cost base and resulting strong profitability, worldwide presence, leading technological capabilities and
solid financial position. As OEMs continue to introduce global platforms and modular toolkits as a basis for a large number of
car models, they are more interested in working with global suppliers with strong development capabilities which can support
them across their international operations.

**_Strong innovation track record_**

The automotive industry has a growing focus on innovation, due to continuously increasing customer expectations
and the need to meet environmental goals and regulatory requirements. Our commitment to developing innovative and high
quality products has defined our approach to our OEM customers. Many of our products are designed and manufactured using
state-of-the-art technologies to implement new functionalities on board the vehicle that provide higher standards of safety,
perceived quality and comfort while also focusing on weight reduction and cost optimization objectives as critical factors
inherent to the automotive sector.

Over the last few years, we have continuously invested in R&D, and for the year ended December 31, 2023, our total
R&D spending amounted to €118.2 million or 2.6% of our net turnover. This level of R&D spending allows us to respond to
the growing demand and requirements of OEMs for products at the forefront of technical innovation. As of December 31, 2023,
we had a dedicated team of 1,622 employees (or 7.0% of our total employees) in engineering functions throughout R&D, design
and calculation engineering, advanced manufacturing and quality control processes, supporting our product innovation
capabilities, as compared to 655 employees in these functions in 2011 (or 5.2% of our total employees).

In recent years, and particularly in 2023, Grupo Antolin’s innovation activities were focused on building up our global
capabilities within the electronic systems/HMI arena in order to provide our clients with innovative technological solutions for
car interiors, to help us improve the overall profitability of the business, be more resilient to industry downturns and increase
our product portfolio and client base. On one hand, we have continued to provide creative responses to the trends that
continually redefine the concept of mobility on a global scale (such as the new CASE+P trends). On the other hand, we have
signed strategic partnerships to further penetrate into high-growth and profitable segments, including geographies such as
China, which are expected to continue delivering business opportunities in the future. For instance, we have recently launched
Antolin joint MIT’s Industrial Liaison Program in order to further our connection to elite schools and universities, and also

**Our Strategies**

Our mission is to be a crucial strategic partner for our OEM customers around the world and across all of our products
while evolving our business portfolio with presence in high-growth markets, increasing our profitability and ensuring our
commitment to science-based targets through our continued focus on sustainability. The strategies to achieve our mission are
based on innovation, flexibility, customer focused growth and further geographic, product and customer diversification, while
maintaining the highest levels of customer satisfaction and continuing to successfully deliver on our strategic plan. We intend
to achieve this by pursuing the following strategies:

**_Continue to be an innovation leader through R&D_**

To remain competitive in the new automotive market, we have worked to enhance our value proposition, which
involves an evolution of the product offering as well as our manufacturing processes and the marketing and distribution to our
customers. Beyond our capacity as a specialized plastics processing company, we have the opportunity to position Grupo
Antolin as an efficient integrator of technologically complex and innovative solutions in the fields of electronics and lighting
for interior components. Thus, in addition to enhancing the value of our products, we expect to be able to meet customers’
requirements to have interlocutors capable of providing multi-technology solutions for larger vehicle platforms, and with whom
we will collaborate starting in the earliest stages of development.

Our objective is to be a smart integrator and a leading innovator in the automotive interior components industry. High
consumer expectations, environmental goals and regulatory changes are three of the main drivers in the automotive market.
We are involved in the design of highly innovative cars as a result of our focus on four main areas:

    - _Materials and Processes: Our materials are designed to generate surfaces which are high quality, have improved_
performance with intensive use and are compatible with the integration of electronic and lighting functions. We
also take into account environmental considerations through the development of more sustainable solutions based
on the use of natural materials, the use of greater proportions of recycled material and the fulfilment of lightweighting objectives to contribute to the reduction of consumption and emissions.

    - _Mobility of the future: We focus on the design of new vehicle interiors and the incorporation of intelligent surfaces_
and advanced functionalities on board the vehicle. This includes the development of new interior concepts to
address the preferences of users in different regions of the world in distinctive ways. It also includes the
development of studies based on user experience for the optimization of visual, thermal and acoustic comfort
aspects.

    - _Electronic functions and technological solutions: Our electronic functions and technological solutions are based_
on the development of hardware and software solutions for the control of functions related to dynamic lighting,
driving assistance, connectivity, infotainment and HMI, among others.

    - _Smart product integration: We engage in researching functions for advanced vehicle interior components and_
mechanism design and automation. The integration includes not only the aspects related to the functionality of
the product, but also its constructive aspects, simplifying architecture and manufacturing or assembly processes
to achieve cost and competitiveness improvements.

_Effects of the CASE+P Model in the global auto market: The global automotive industry is being shaped and heavily_
impacted by the increasing importance of technological shifts in recent years, as well as by significant changes in customer
demands and needs precipitated by recent lifestyle changes. Currently, the vast majority of car models marketed have innovative
technologies aimed at facilitating and improving the driving experience, as well as providing additional safety features to users.
Automobiles are expected to become increasingly connected, autonomous, shared, electric and personalized, thus opening a
broad range of new possibilities and business opportunities for those companies which are well positioned and have global
capabilities. Our long-term strategic plan is focused on increasing the capabilities within our Technology Solutions segment in
order to become a leading smart systems integrator and provider of innovative technological solutions to our clients. Our aim
is to continue improving our global profitability and increase our customer base.

**_Become a global full-service supplier to OEMs_**

We intend to strengthen our position as a Tier 1 supplier for automobile interiors with an extensive production and
supply network that can flexibly service our customers on a global basis, providing major OEMs access to our global platform
and product portfolio. In addition, we hope to increasingly take on additional responsibilities and activities of OEMs by
managing Tier 2 and Tier 3 suppliers, thereby improving the manufacturing and product development efforts of our customers.

104


-----

Our approach to project and production management is increasingly focused on integral execution by locating our
technical and manufacturing facilities close to the decision-making and manufacturing centers of our customers. Additionally,
we aim to ensure engineering benchmarking, continuous improvements in operational excellence and standardization of
processes in every country in which we operate. We intend to develop new industrial processes able to produce different
products with the same investment.

**_Evolving our business portfolio with a focus on high-margin products and presence in high-growth markets_**

We intend to deploy several key initiatives in relation to our products and our geographies in order to accelerate our
growth.

In relation to our products, our aim is to deploy initiatives for both our Technology Solutions segment and, to a lesser
extent, our Product Systems segment, in each case in order to focus on high-margin products and divest non-core ones. As part
of our Technology Solutions segment, we are committed to developing our offering of integrated solutions with other business
units in order to avoid commoditization. We have entered into strategic partnerships in order to bolster our offering of
innovative technological solutions, including in connection with smart touch and display technologies. For instance, our joint
venture with AED Vantage Group (formerly known as Matoma Capital), which specializes in the development and production
of embedded electronic systems for the automotive sector, has allowed us to strengthen our Electronic Systems products, which
we consider to be a key pillar in order to consolidate our position as a global provider of in-car technological solutions. In order
to achieve further growth within our Technology Solutions system, we expect to consider further transactions via selective,
value-enhancing strategic joint ventures and alliances (but excluding material acquisitions), in line with our overall growth
plan. We also plan to leverage our global footprint in order to develop a global engineering model, as opposed to independent
regional teams, with a view to deploying our Technology Solutions across all of our markets. As part of our Product Systems
segment, we intend to focus on value-added solutions in order to strengthen our leadership in the manufacturing of headliner
modular solutions. We will also consider, if deemed accretive, strategic alliances with logistics operators in order to standardize
and automate our industrial processes while concentrating our production. As a result of these initiatives, we expect that our
Technology Solutions segment will represent a larger share of our net turnover by 2027.

In relation to our geographies, we have increased, and plan to continue to increase our presence in Asia consistently
with the development trend of the automotive market in the region. Asia continues to be a significant contributor to margin
expansion. Our net turnover derived from the Asia region has increased from €82.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2010 to €756.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of
growth opportunities in Asia as a result of our existing footprint of high-quality production facilities in the region. We intend
to capitalize on our current operations and reputation to increase our presence in the region through selective and disciplined
investments and partnerships. For example, we have four TCOs and we operate 22 sites in China as of the date of this Offering
Memorandum. We also have two TCOs and six operating sites in India, where we plan to further increase our market share of
electronic systems while also maintaining our leadership in headliners. We believe that our expansion plans in South-East Asia
and Asia in general will allow us to serve customers who will be future global leaders in the automotive industry. In addition
to Asia, we also plan to adapt our presence in Europe by targeting new OEMs entering the EU and focusing on competitive
production countries, as well as in North America by targeting faster-growing new segments for us such as pick-up trucks and
establishing new partnerships with local suppliers to enhance our value proposition. As a result of these initiatives, we expect
that the net turnover generated by Asia as a percentage of our total net turnover will increase, while the net turnover generated
by Europe as a percentage of our total net turnover will decrease.

**_Optimize our financial performance through the implementation of our strategic plan in order to improve our cash_**
**_flow profile and our liquidity_**

We aim to continue implementing our strategic plan in order to enhance our profitability through higher profit margins
and further improve our cash flow profile and liquidity. As part of our strategic plan, we expect to continue optimizing our
footprint and rightsizing our business operations through productivity improvement resulting from advanced manufacturing
processes. In addition, we also intend to continue enhancing direct labor efficiency through automation, as well as indirect
labor efficiency through structural streamlining. In November 2023, we disposed of Antolin Austria Holding and our associated
product systems division in Austria. Our aim is to reduce our current footprint by up to 15% and we expect to achieve liquidity
of approximately €150 million through selective asset sales, with identified potential for additional gains by completing further
divestments in our current pipeline. We also intend to further optimize our footprint by continuing to increase our operations
in low-cost countries in Eastern Europe and North America in order to streamline our operations and reduce our cost base. As
of March 31, 2024, our total workforce included approximately 25,000 workers, compared to 27,000 workers as of December
31, 2023 and 29,000 workers as of December 31, 2022.

105


-----

In addition, we have changed our project selection method by switching away from a volume-based approach and
instead focusing on internal rate of return payback and capital expenditures as a percentage of net turnover, as well as
renegotiating development projects and removing target projects with lower scores. We plan on continuing implementing our
new approach towards project selection across all of our operations in order to reduce our capital expenditures, with an
estimated 659 projects currently under review. Our new quoting system is expected to further boost the profitability of our
order intakes and will be coupled with a high level of already booked sales, with an estimated backlog of €17.0 billion until
2027 (driven by €7 billion of order intakes in 2022 and €5.5 billion of order intakes in 2023), which represents approximately
85% of our component sales target for the same period. Of our estimated €17.0 billion of backlog, we currently estimate that
(i) between approximately 85% to 90% will be within our Product Systems segment, with the remainder within our Technology
Systems segment, and (ii) between approximately 35% to 40% will be in North America, 15% to 20% will be in Asia and the
remainder will be in Europe & ROW. As a result, we expect that the implementation of our business plan will allow us to
benefit from a sustainable, profitable and diversified growth in the medium term. We envisage operating with limited leverage
through a disciplined financial strategy adapted to our long-term growth needs, which we believe will allow us to achieve a
ratio of adjusted net financial debt to Management EBITDA of 1.5x or less, as well as double digit Management EBITDA
margin.

Our ability to achieve the financial targets and objectives set out above is subject to significant business, economic and
competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and our financial targets and objectives
have been developed based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions and conditions that are subject to change.
As a result, our actual results may vary from the financial targets and objectives set out above, and those variations may be
material. We do not undertake to publish revised financial targets and objectives to reflect events or circumstances existing or
arising after the date of the Offering Memorandum or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—We may fail to achieve the targeted benefits from our strategic plan,” “Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our order backlog is not necessarily indicative of our future sales or results of_
_operations” and “Presentation of Financial Information and Other Data—Backlog.” Certain of the foregoing are forward-_
looking statements. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”

**_Continuing to follow advanced ESG practices and strategies_**

We are also committed to adopting and continuing to follow ESG principles, including adherence to objectives by
Science Based Targets (SBTi). Our objective is to renew and enhance our continued focus on the environment by becoming a
carbon neutral company by 2040, including a 75% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2028 compared to 2019 levels. We are also
focused on becoming a circular business by aiming to create supply chains that recover or recycle the resources used to create
our products, thereby reducing our environmental footprint. For instance, we use ecodesign in order to systematically
incorporate environmental considerations into the design process of our products, and are also aiming to decrease our nonhazardous waste by 10% in 2028 compared to 2019 levels.

We are also committed to integrating and encouraging management to contribute to generating a responsible culture
of transparency, ethics and compliance that promotes a safe and healthy work environment. We have voluntarily adopted a
number of good governance standards applicable to Spanish listed companies. Our Corporate Governance Model is made up
of a set of rules and principles that ensure the proper functioning of our governing and administrative bodies. In addition to
mandatory corporate responsibility policies, our Corporate Governance Model includes a separate code of ethics and conduct,
certain corporate policies (Compliance Policy, Gifts and Hospitality Policy and Anti-Corruption Policy) and other internal
codes, processes and procedures required or recommended through sector-related provisions. Our management model enables
Grupo Antolin to meet the requirements of several international management system standards and internal management needs
(e.g., ISO 37001 Anti-Bribery Management Systems, UNE 19601 Management System for Criminal Compliance).

Additionally, we continually work to improve our corporate governance structure and conducted several activities in
2023 including, among others, the update of commitments and approval of corporate policies on compliance, anti-corruption,
corporate social responsibility and human rights, as well as those related to the environment and energy. We are committed
and will continue to commit to the promotion of a diverse and inclusive work culture focused on knowledge, skills and
experiences that drive societal development.

**Product Systems**

Our Product Systems segment is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard Trim, (iii) Instrument
Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) Components and JITs. The diversification of our product portfolio has helped us to
strengthen our strategic relationships with OEMs, who are able to turn to us for innovative and market leading product solutions

across the value chain. As of December 31, 2023, we had 376 projects in development phase across our product portfolio.
Furthermore, we have also provided our products to over 600 car models, and to nine out of ten of the global best-selling car
models during the year. We have a significant number of projects signed and currently in development, and as of December
31, 2023, our estimated backlog between 2024 and 2027 was approximately €17.0 billion. See “Summary—Our Key
_Strategies—Optimize our financial performance through the implementation of our strategic plan in order to improve our cash_
_flow profile and our liquidity.”_

**_Headliners_**

An overhead system comprises the headliner as well as all the components associated with it. Headliners conceal roof
sheet metal, wiring and safety airbags and incorporate interior components, thus improving the perceived quality of the vehicle
by the eventual vehicle owner. Our headliner product is a composite material that is affixed to the inside of the metal panel of
a vehicle’s roof. The headliner is a fundamental aspect of a vehicle’s design and functionality and plays an important role in
the aesthetics, comfort, safety and acoustics of the vehicle. From the start of our business, our overhead systems have identified
us on a global scale as a pioneer in the R&D of such technologies. Overhead systems can be adapted to different configurations,
from the simplest headliners through to the most complex modular integration. Our components include: substrate, sun visors,
consoles, lighting, grab handles, air conditioning vents and solar protection systems. We develop technological solutions to
account for key factors such as head impact regulations and the integration of fabric and lighting elements. The extensive offer
meets the requirements of all segments available in the market.

_Manufacturing process_

We begin the production process of our headliners by analyzing our customer’s requirements as well as the features
and components that will be incorporated into the headliner. Our technical departments determine the ideal material
construction and technology to produce the headliner at the most competitive cost and our engineering team then builds the
detailed 3D specifications of the product. Once the part has been engineered, we begin the manufacturing process. We
manufacture our headliners using two production techniques: thermosetting technology and thermoplastic technology.
Thermosetting technology uses a multi-layered composite structure (combining a core of polyurethane foam and layers of
adhesive, glass fiber and an aesthetical cover) which is converted into a rigid product using a heating process, while
thermoplastic technology uses a board of a fibrous material which is heated in a specialized oven and then pressed into its final
shape using a cooling process.

The core material of the headliner is polyurethane foam. Manufacturing the foam is integrated in every production
facility allowing us to customize the properties of the foam in accordance with customer specifications to achieve certain
density, mechanical and acoustic requirements. The foam is created in large blocks which are then cut down in size to the
required dimension and thickness. Once the foam is cut into the appropriate dimensions, it is coated with adhesive, a catalyst
is sprayed over the foam, then two layers of glass fiber are placed on and underneath the foam. Finally, a backing layer, either
fleece or paper, is placed on the bottom side and an aesthetical layer, a textile or carpet, is placed on the upper side in order to
create the final “sandwich” structure. The graphic below illustrates the final “sandwich” product:

The formed “sandwich” is then transferred into a heated tool to shape the headliner. After forming the headliner, it is
trimmed using a pressurized water stream or with special die-cut tooling. In the thermoplastic stage, our thermoplastic
technology processes boards of fibrous materials which are blends of polyester or polypropylene fibers with glass fibers by
heating the boards in an infra-red oven and then molding the boards in a cold press while, at the same time, feeding the interior
textile finish into the mold. Finally, the part is trimmed by water jet. The thermoplastic lines are fully automatic, reducing labor

-----

costs and boosting the competitiveness of this technology. Following customer and market demands, we have developed
different technologies to assemble various components, such as sunroof frames, console frames, fixing or locator features on
the back of the headliner. These components can be incorporated during the forming or covering steps or in a specific additional
tooling.

As of December 31, 2023, the production process for our Headliners division is spread out across over 36 facilities
worldwide.

_Customers and competitors_

We sell our overhead systems globally and our main clients consist of most OEMs worldwide, including Ford,
Hyundai, Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan and Stellantis, among others. Our global footprint in design and industrial
capacity is a key factor for obtaining and maintaining our relationships with these OEMs.

The main competitors for our overhead systems are IAC, Howa Tramico, Toyota Boshoku, Tuopu, Motus, IMR
(Industriale Sud), NVH Korea Group, among others.

**_Doors & Hard Trim_**

We produce door systems (including front, rear and sliding door panels), pillars (including upper and lower pillar trim
and quarter trim panels), rear cargo and liftgate trim and related components and also assemble complete door modules
including components such as door latches, harnesses, loud-speakers and sealing. We also produce seat latches for specific
vehicle platforms. A door panel is the component covering the internal side of a vehicle’s door. The door panel hides the door’s
metal panel and the internal components of the door such as window regulators, latches and certain wiring. The panel also
incorporates electric switches, pull handles and armrests. The door panel brings together numerous different mechanical
features and also plays a key feature in the interior design of the vehicle.

We have pioneered the introduction of lightweight technologies for injected thermoplastic in the European market, as
well as in the use of environmentally-friendly processes and materials. Our techniques for injected plastic trim include chemical
foaming injection, which achieves weight reduction in comparison to conventional technology.

The finish of a pillar trim can be fabric/leather wrapped or textured resin color matched to be in harmony with the
headliner. We develop and test pillars to protect the driver during crash and for easy airbag deployment. Our focus on hardtrim activities is on using our innovative ideas to increase the added value of this product line, thereby offering a better product
at a competitive price. The most noteworthy features of our hard-trim activities are the wide range of materials and technologies
we can offer OEMs in conventional plastic covers, laminated parts or textile back injection pillars, with this last core
competence focused on premium vehicles.

_Manufacturing process_

We begin the production process by analyzing our customer’s requirements as well as the features and components
that will be incorporated into the door panel. Our technical departments determine the ideal material construction and
technology to produce the door panel at the most competitive cost and our engineering team then builds the detailed 3D
specifications of the product. Once the part has been engineered, we begin the manufacturing process. Due to the cutting-edge
elements of these door panels, the traditional assembly chain is extremely complex. We provide OEMs with a final product
which combines technical features with design while at the same time reducing the industrial complexity of the assembly chain.

A door panel is composed of several parts and each of them uses a different technology and production process. The
first step of production is generally either injection molding or thermoplastic processing. Injection molding consists of plastic
material being melted in order to fill a mold which is then cooled to solidify the panel. Door panels constructed using
thermoplastic are produced with a thermoplastic shell, which is heated in an oven or a press machine and a mold. Once the
plastic component is finalized, a variety of covering technologies are utilized to cover the part with leather or fabric. The
technologies used for the covering process include vacuum technology, edge wrapping and laser cutting which allows designs
to be laser cut into the final product. Once all the individual parts are produced, they must be assembled together. The assembly
process can be done in one of our production plants or can be done, totally or just partially, in a JIT facility close to the assembly
plant of the customer to reduce logistic cost.

**_Instrument Panels and Central Consoles_**

We are a global producer and supplier of cockpits modules, which include instrument panels, center consoles and
glove boxes. The cockpit module plays a key role in defining the driver’s experience and it integrates the instrument panel and
several control functions such as HVAC, cross car beam, steering column, wiring harness, instrument cluster, air vents,
decorative inlays, glove boxes and passenger airbag systems, among others. Our system integration capabilities allow us to
design, engineer, manufacture and assemble these elements and supply complete cockpit systems for OEMs. The focus of this
division is on innovation, examples of which include lighter materials, integration of electrical connection and increased
functions.

The instrumental panel is the dashboard located directly in front of a vehicle’s driver, displaying instrumentation and
controls for the vehicle’s operation. It is a key element of the cockpit module and is comprised of a sophisticated system of
trims, foams, composites and metals. We provide a full range of instrument panel offerings to meet OEM design specifications
and price points in every vehicle segment, from entry level to premium and luxury vehicles. While designing and manufacturing
the instrument panels, our engineers primarily focus on quality, function and decoration, while optimizing the cost/quality ratio.
Our vertical integration capabilities also enable us to produce the majority of the components for instrument panel systems,
including air distribution ducts, decorative appliqués and other plastic trim.

The center consoles are the control-bearing surfaces in the center of the front of the vehicle interior, often beginning
in the instrument panel and continuing beneath it, running between the front of the driver and passenger seats. The center
consoles complement the instrument panels and have become an increasingly complex part of our Instrument Panels and Central
Consoles division. Their design, in terms of ergonomic, comfort and quality play a significant role in the car interior. Our main
focus with respect to center consoles is enabling the operation of vehicle functions and maximizing storage space. We have
developed several innovative console features, such as movable consoles or storage areas combined with adjustable armrests.
We also employ many of the same features and technologies used in our instrumental panels, such as sewn leather, appliques
and air distribution, to ensure interior design continuity.

Our glove boxes are a key element of the instrument panel focusing on functionality. Storage and structural support
for the complete system are some of the most noteworthy features of our glove boxes.

Our main current capabilities in this division include styling, engineering, tooling, manufacturing, assembly and
sequencing and electrical/electronic system integration. In the final stages of the integration process, we expect to also be
capable of creating synergies between other divisions and products, such as Lighting. Integration of light into traditional plastic
components is a defined target of our OEMs.

_Manufacturing process_

The primary technologies and processes employed in the manufacturing of interior components and systems include
low pressure and injection molding, compression molding, vacuum forming, slush skins, spray urethane, leather covering,
foaming as well as manual and automated assembly and sequencing.

We manufacture our instrument panels by injection molding of the main structural elements as carrier, warm air duct,
center stack, airbag chute and glove box housing. For providing the surface of an instrument panel, the processes of vacuum
covering and gluing, welding, foaming, hand and semi-automated covering of leather, milling, punching and laser
cutting/weakening are performed. Assembly of air vents, bezels, plastic components and decorative trim parts completes the

109


-----

final product. To provide a complete cockpit, the following additional modules have to be assembled: cross car beam, wiring
harness, climate control unit, steering column, electrical and electronical modules. An electrical end of line test ensures full
functional performance of a cockpit before being delivered to the customer.

In order to manufacture our center consoles, we begin by injection molding of carrier and structural elements similar
to the instrument panel. Process steps of welding, vacuum covering, foaming, leather wrapping and assembly of bezels and
decorative trim parts are employed to complete the final product. Our glove boxes are manufactured through a combination of
injection molding, welding, foaming, covering and final assembly.

As of December 31, 2023, the production process is spread out between 10 facilities worldwide.

_Customers and competitors_

We sell our Instrument Panels and Central Consoles products primarily in Europe, North America and Asia,
particularly in China. Our main clients are among the top OEMs in the world, including Leapmotor, Ford, Nio and Volvo in

**_Components and JITs_**

We are a global producer of sun visors and window regulators.

_Manufacturing process_

The sun visor product is an interior component located above the windshield, designed to protect the driver from the
sun. All sun visors are designed with a hinge that is adjustable to help shade the eyes of drivers and passengers from the glare
of sunlight. Some luxury cars are equipped with doubled-shaded sun visors, allowing the driver and passengers to turn one of
the shades toward the side window and the other forwards to the windshield to improve sunlight protection performance. The
sun visor is an interior component with visual, functional and security customer requirements. Due to these last two
requirements we invest significantly in concept design and we try to simulate as much as possible to obtain a robust product.
The complete validation of a sun visor is complex and time consuming because of these requirements. One of the most recent
pieces of equipment acquired by the Company is the ECE21, which differentiates us from our competitors and allows us to
carry out head impact testing, greatly appreciated by our customers.

Sun visors are made up of several components and many different materials and processes. The core of the sun visor
is made of injected plastic covered by various materials. The most popular cover is PVC. Other components are assembled to
the sun visor, including plastic fasteners, metallic springs to ensure a good rotational function, vanity mirrors, airbag labels and
ticket holders. The mirror is one of the most valued components in a sun visor and there are many varieties: non lighted, lighted
with incandescent lamps or new LED generation. The LED mirrors are developed and produced in collaboration with our
Technology Solutions segment. The different assembly processes are manual, semi-automatic or fully automatized depending
on the concept and the production country. Once we assemble all the components and obtain the finished product, we have a
standardized and automatic quality control system in all our production lines worldwide to ensure final quality. The sun visor
market is very competitive. To win new business and reduce the quality issues, it is necessary to work on in-house standard
components, design guides and standard processes.

A window regulator is the component that moves the window in the door. The main function of the regulator is to
move the window through a mechanic actuator engaged by a handle or by an electric motor. We develop and produce window
regulators of any morphology as another component of the door system we offer, all of which satisfy the quality, cost, weight
and ease of assembly demands of each client’s assembly line and are subject to a rigorous validation processes to offer the very
highest standards of reliability. Additionally, we have extensive experience in designing, validating and implementing motors
in our window regulator systems. These motors have changed significantly in recent years, from being considered a high-end
product to becoming a mass-produced standard in most vehicles. Our motors incorporate an electronic anti-pinch system which
enables them to be activated automatically and safely, as well as forming part of the vehicle’s electronic communications
network. We developed and validated our first plastic window regulator and started production in 2016. It is a significant

product improvement, as plastic window regulators are extremely light-weight. We were the first to market a plastic window
regulator in Europe and we have started to successfully introduce the modular versions of plastic window regulators,
establishing Grupo Antolin as a key player in light-weight solutions.

Window regulators are composed of several parts and each of them have a different technology and process of
production. We use injection molding and stamping to make most of the individual parts which are then assembled using a
variety of techniques including robotic and manual assembly lines.

As of December 31, 2023, the production process is spread out between 26 facilities worldwide.

_Customers and competitors_

In relation to window regulators, our main competitors are Brose, Hi Lex, Kwangjin and Shiroki Corporation, among
others, and our main customers are Stellatis, Renault-Nissan Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, among others.

In relation to sun visors, our main competitors are Shanghai Daimay, Toyota Boshoku, Kasai Kogyo, Shanghai Huate
and Yong San, among others.

**Technology Solutions**

Creating light scenarios and sophisticated atmospheres, as well as providing innovative technological solutions, is one
of our main areas of expertise. We offer complete interior solutions including those based on LED such as overhead consoles,
side reading lamps, multi-purpose lamps, ambient lighting, electronics/smart lighting and exterior solutions such as daytime
running lamps, center high mounted stop lamps and direction, position and license plate indicators.

As one of the key players in the market, we pay special attention to innovation in this segment, maintaining strong
development capabilities, mainly in electronics and optical design. We are seeing increasing innovation in the market for our
products. We now see solid-state LED technology replacing the historic incandescent lighting technology as well as specialized
electronics becoming increasingly present in even the simpler products. As the state-of-the-art technology evolves in each of
these product ranges to include more functionality and finishing of the highest possible quality, we are evolving our production
processes to match.

_Manufacturing process_

As with our other business segments, we begin the production process by analyzing our customer’s requirements with
regard to interior automotive lighting. Our production capabilities are vertically integrated, mastering the complete industrial
process from R&D, conception and tooling to material processing, assembly, packaging and delivery.

The production processes for our lighting segment varies depending on the type of lighting required by our end
customers. The manufacturing processes include plastic injection, different types of coatings, ultrasonic and vibration welding,
electronics components processing, including PIN insertion for press-fit pin replacement of classical connector technology,
wire-to-PCB soldering in the form of hot bar soldering, 100% in-line LED measurements and calibration, laser marking, wire
stripping, tinning and termination equipment. We also have significant capacity in stamping technology which gives us a strong
competitive edge in producing parts that essentially combine the functionality of electrical circuits, connectors and parts
supports. Our toolmakers are renowned for their skills in creating complex tools that produce elegant and cost-effective mass
production parts.

Furthermore, we are now equipped in-house with surface mounted device assembly process equipment in three sites.
This enables us not only to be competitive with our offers, but also to stay abreast of the rapid evolution of customer
requirements, and complements supply from our traditional subcontractor base.

As of December 31, 2023, the production process is spread out between 15 facilities across China, Spain, Germany,
India, Mexico, France, the UK, Romania and the Czech Republic.

_Customers and competitors_

We sell our interior automotive lighting products primarily in Europe, North America, South America and Asia,
particularly in China. Our main clients are among the top OEMs in the world, including Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan,

111


-----

Stellantis and Mercedes-Benz, among others, as well as many Tier 1s. Our global footprint in design and industrial capacity is
a key factor for obtaining and maintaining our relationships with these OEMs.

The main competitors for our lighting products are Il Heung, Xingyu Automotive, Forvia (formerly Hella), LS
Automotive (formerly Daesung) and Silder, among others. Our competitive advantages lie in several factors, namely our global
reach, electronics capabilities, design, our efficient cost structure and our ability to stay ahead of our competitors. Our expertise
in retro illuminated decorative inserts thanks to our strategic alliance with Walter Pack makes Grupo Antolin the partner of
choice for interior ambient solutions.

**Suppliers**

We purchase various components and materials for use in our manufacturing processes. All of these components and
materials are available from numerous sources and we currently source materials from 2,598 suppliers of which approximately
18% account for approximately 80% of total purchase volumes. We source our key materials from at least two main suppliers
of international recognition which enables us to negotiate more favorable terms and provides us with added price protection.
In addition, we estimate that approximately 43% of the value of the materials we source comes from suppliers who have price
transfer agreements directly with our customers where costs of materials outside of certain ranges are passed onto the OEM,
thus helping us to minimize the impact of material price fluctuations.

Lyondell Basell, Lear Corporation, FORVIA, The Renco Group/Inteva, BASF, Illinois Tool Works, Continental,
Yazaki and Covestro among others.

We conduct permanent monitoring and collaboration with our supply chain, at an international level. Our
implementation of the warehouse management system guarantees accurate supply by suppliers. We work to promote medium
and long-term relationships to achieve mutual growth.

**Customers and Geography**

Relative to our competitors, we have a well-diversified customer base which, through a successful development
strategy, has expanded to include over 100 different automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs in 2023. For the
year ended December 31, 2023, our top five OEM customers accounted 65.4% of our net turnover. The most significant
increases from our key customers since January 1, 2023 have come from Renault-Nissan, which accounted for 5.0% of our
total net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022.

We have developed long-standing business relationships with our automotive customers around the world. We work
together with our customers along the full value chain, including development, industrial engineering, tooling and
manufacturing. Quality assurance programs matching the highest standards underlie our service offering. In emerging
economies in particular, our customers are focusing their own resources on vehicle assembly and seek to outsource to suppliers
that are capable of providing an integrated supply service. We believe that our customers perceive us as a supplier that is
capable on a global scale of providing (i) high-quality products at competitive prices with standardized high-level quality;
(ii) innovative solutions for complex projects and (iii) on-time delivery and quality customer service.

Mandates in the automotive OEM business involve long-term production arrangements based on the lifecycle of the
specific model or platform. As a result of our strategic and long-term relationships with our OEM customers, and given the
prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching suppliers, particularly during the life cycle of a specific
vehicle model, we have strong visibility on our mid-term revenues. Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our strong
customer relationships to obtain similar awards in the future.

In addition to being diversified, our customer base is weighted towards premium and financially stable OEMs,
meaning that, subject to the stage of the automotive industry cycle and prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our revenue
streams are relatively secure.

Our geographical diversification strategy is aligned with the ongoing expansion by OEMs into emerging economies
and the consolidation of their existing presence in established markets. As OEMs have sought to establish presence in growth
markets and to grow outside of their home markets, we have adapted our geographical diversification strategy to focus less on
our presence in Western Europe, which is well established, and more on these growing markets.

112


-----

While we continue to pursue a measured strategy of geographical diversification, the basis of our technological
expertise is in Western Europe, with growing support teams in Asia and North America in order to better understand local
needs in these markets.

**Research, Development, Innovation and Intellectual Property**

We operate in a highly competitive and globalized industry and must constantly change and adapt to meet our
customer’s needs and expectations. We consider innovation and R&D to be key success factors in the differentiation of our
products and services from those of our competitors.

One of the global trends in the automotive industry is the increased focus on innovative and technologically advanced
products that seek to address the parallel concerns of improved safety for passengers and road users and the reduction of weight
and emissions. Our commitment to developing innovative, high quality products has defined our approach to our customers.
Investment in R&D is one of our main drivers.

Through the development of our innovation programs, we contribute to the objectives of Grupo Antolin to prepare for
the exciting future that the automotive sector has ahead:

    - To increase the added value of the company's current products and simultaneously be able to access new product
ranges with greater technological sophistication.

    - To improve our technical and industrial capacities in order to prepare for future mobility trends, as well as to
improve our market position as suppliers of high technological content.

    - To differentiate Grupo Antolin’s offer with respect to its competitors by introducing innovations that allow
optimization of costs, technical performance, functionality, comfort and perceived quality inside the vehicle.

    - To improve aspects of industrial flexibility and efficiency, helping to implement advanced manufacturing tools
in order to ensure the competitive strength of Grupo Antolin to face the current situation of uncertainty in the
automotive market.

    - To contribute to the fulfilment of the environmental commitments that affect the sector, including emission
reductions in the coming years, as well as the implementation of circular economy characteristics that are
becoming increasingly necessary.

The innovation strategy designed to achieve these objectives includes the development of open innovation initiatives.
In this regard, during 2023 our innovation and advanced engineering teams have been focusing on a broad number of
technologies, including the Antolin VIVAR virtual concept car, which can be accessed with facial recognition, the prototype
of an interior sanitization system, an AI-based optimization of the car user experience, a lighting system improving the comfort
and safety of night driving, a new sustainable compound material and a plant-based alternative to leather lining. During the
first half of 2024, we have also presented two new mono-material solutions enabling full recycling, an innovative door panel
concept and a new horizon of integration for cockpits in collaboration with VIA optronics.

Additionally, the company has continued to focus on a number of strategies aimed at further positioning ourselves as
a leading integrator of innovative technologies applied to interiors, including:

    - Attracting talent, knowledge and skills with which to face the challenges affecting the sector;

    - Expanding our innovation ecosystem, consolidating external technical support teams, as well as new collaboration
models and alliances; and

    - Conceiving new solutions to enhance our products and processes.

The strategy also considers the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies and R&D
organizations. In 2023, collaborative agreements were established with VIA optronics AG, Biometric Vox, e2ip and
WalterPack alliance.

At Grupo Antolin, we carry out our R&D work through a rigorous process called “Innovation Development Process.”
This development involves a multi-stage process aimed at turning ideas into innovations that can ultimately be commercialized.
The initial stage of the process is designed to foster generation of ideas and includes, among others: identification,
understanding and analysis of social, digital, demographic, regulatory, industry and other trends which may create demand for,
and thus drive development of new automotive technologies, competitive intelligence, technological observation,
freedom-to-operate analysis, review of academic research and automotive customer input. Concepts that progress past this
initial stage are further evaluated, including with respect to commercialization opportunities, as well as potential risks and
challenges to further development. Winning innovations progress through subsequent stages towards product or process
realization, validation and, eventually, product launch.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred €118.2 million, or 2.6% of our net turnover, in R&D. Our
innovative products and market leading processes are developed through our targeted R&D platforms across R&D centers
throughout Europe, Asia, North America and South America.

Underlying our innovative products and processes and in-house capabilities is the maintenance of rigorous quality
management and testing systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities. Through regular internal audits we are
able to ensure that our products and processes are monitored to the highest industry standards. We believe that these
competencies and capabilities along the entire value chain give us a competitive advantage over many of the other suppliers.

**Joint Ventures**

Joint ventures constitute a key aspect of our business strategy and we operate in many countries by means of
partnerships with local partners. Joint ventures have historically been a strategic way for us to enter new geographies. While in
some joint ventures we are not the majority shareholder, we nonetheless often exercise operational control over these entities.
Below we present a summary of our latest material joint ventures (which are not considered “joint ventures” as defined under
IFRS).

_China- Hefei Antolin Auto Parts Co., Ltd._

In May 2021, we formed a joint venture with Changshu Automotive Trim Co., Ltd., in which the Group, via its
subsidiary Changshu Antolin Automotive Interiors Co., Ltd., holds a 60% stake.

_China- Shanghai Antolin Naen Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd_

In March 2021, we formed a joint venture with NAEN Auto Technology, which specializes in the electronics of
keyless vehicle entry and ignition systems, in which the Group holds a 51% interest.

_Spain-Matoma Capital S.L_

In July 2020, we acquired a 49% equity stake in Matoma Capital, S.L. (now known as AED Vantage Group), which
specializes in the development and production of embedded electronic systems for the automotive sector. This joint venture
has allowed us to strengthen our Electronic Systems products, which we consider to be a key pillar in order to consolidate our
position as a global provider of in-car technological solutions.

**Property, Plant and Equipment**

**Environmental**

We have a strong commitment to environmental issues and the impact of our operations on the environment, including
with respect to climate change. We are also committed to maintaining high standards of health and safety, both environmental
and general. We have approved a management model, aimed at covering any key legal requirements, and which currently
applies to each entity in our Group. As of December 31, 2023, we had over 89 employees dedicated to environmental issues
and approximately 75 employees dedicated to health and safety issues.

As manufacturers of automotive components, the environmental impact generated by us have to be taken into account
throughout the life cycle of the vehicle and not only during the manufacturing phase of our parts. For this reason, we are
committed to adapting and using the best techniques available for our components, as well as including environmental aspects
in the design and operation of them. For example, our innovation processes seek weight reduction and make use of biomaterials
and natural fibers, our design processes seek new products and production processes centered around efficient use of resources
and energy, and we seek out recycling options for the components at the end of their useful life.

Over the past three years, we have had no relevant material environmental issues, actions, claims or liabilities that
could have had a significant impact on our equity, financial position or results, and are currently not aware of any such issues,
actions, claims or liabilities, excluding the claim in Brazil against our subsidiary Trimtec. See “—Proceedings”.

As of December 31, 2023, we had achieved environmental certification in accordance with the standard ISO 14001
for 93 plants and production centers. The chart below shows a breakdown of our 93 ISO 14001 certifications by region as of
December 31, 2023:

**ISO14001**

**Region** **Certifications**

Europe & ROW.................................................................................................................................. 54
North America ................................................................................................................................... 22
Asia .................................................................................................................................................... 17

**Total ..................................................................................................................................................** **93**

Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we had achieved new energy efficiency certification in accordance with the
standard ISO 50001 for eight companies in Europe.

Our environmental activities focus on two general areas: (i) environmental management system, based on manuals
and procedures common to all the centers defining the measures to ensure strict compliance with current legislation, the rational
use of resources and energy and minimizing the generation of waste; and (ii) environmentally sensitive design, where we focus
our design of our products with a view to minimizing the environmental impact of the vehicle over its useful life.

**Health and Safety**

In terms of health and safety, we are aware of the risks in our business and have a policy that ensures that both our
employees and those from other companies working on our premises have a safe and healthy working environment. In
accordance with this policy, we use the same criteria when assessing the performance of any company in terms of health and
safety and no difference is established between the companies operating in the countries in which we are present. Our
management plan, based on the ISO 45001 model, includes the identification and verification of any applicable regulations, as
well as the performance of internal audit controls to verify any applicable preventive measures and the level of compliance.
We also have a system of audit in place which verifies that any measures in health and safety meet with the criteria established
in our policies, thereby assuring reliability and comparability among the companies.

**Proceedings**

We are from time to time involved in legal proceedings, claims or investigations that are incidental to the conduct of
our business. We vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. In future periods, we could be subject to cash costs or
non-cash charges to earnings if any of these matters are resolved on unfavorable terms. However, although the ultimate outcome
of any legal matter cannot be predicted with certainty, based on current information, including our assessment of the merits of
the particular claims, we do not expect that our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material adverse impact on our
future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

**Employees**

As of December 31, 2023, our total number of employees was approximately 23,000 globally (including employees
from associated companies), of which approximately 55% were based in Europe & ROW, 18% in Asia and 27% in North
America. The breakdown of our employees by business segment as of December 31, 2023 is as follows: approximately 76%
in Product Systems, and approximately 12% in Technology Solutions.

Our strategy is to manage relations with our employees primarily on a plant level, with the “plant works council”
being the forum for employee representation most favored by our employees. As a general rule, each plant has its own collective
agreement. This policy allows us to benefit from a number of advantages:

    - collective agreements are adapted to the specific circumstances and needs of each plant (for example different
geographic areas within a country may have different average salary or cost of living allowances);

    - collective agreements can be adapted to the economic performance and productivity of each plant; and

    - workers identify themselves better with their own “plant works council” rather than with a country level one.

In addition to this strategy, we try to build open and trusting relations with union representatives at regional level or
country level, in order to allow a bi-directional communication channel to provide them with relevant information, but also to
understand their real worries and concerns.

Where necessary and where the legal and regulatory labor and employment framework in a jurisdiction allows, we
have implemented measures such as temporary reduction of the workforce, early retirement programs (as a way to achieve cost
reduction in the short-term and to reduce the average age of the staff in the medium to long-term) and “substitute contracts”,
which have proven to be an efficient way to manage costs and rejuvenate the workforce, while accommodating the aging
population.

_Agreement, the 2028 Notes and other financing arrangements after giving effect to the Transactions. This section is intended_
_to be a summary only and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of the topics summarized. Terms not_
_defined in the following section have the meanings given to them in the Senior Facilities Agreement._

Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. is a party to a senior term and revolving facilities agreement dated March 13, 2014, as
amended and/or amended and restated on June 4, 2015, October 26, 2016, April 27, 2018, June 3, 2020, May 20, 2021, August

the original lenders listed therein and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as agent (“Agent”) and security agent.

_Facilities_

After giving effect to the A&E pursuant to the ARA on the A&E Effective Date, the Senior Facilities Agreement
provides for committed facilities as set out below:

    - a euro term loan facility (“Facility A”) in an aggregate amount of €338.1 million, comprising (i) a tranche in an
aggregate principal amount of €8.6 million (“Facility A1”) with an amortizing repayment profile (as set out
below) maturing on March 31, 2026 (the “Original Maturity Date”) and (ii) a tranche in an aggregate principal
amount of €329.5 million (“Facility A6”) with an amortizing repayment profile (as set out below) maturing on
the Extended Maturity Date (as defined below); and

    - a multi-currency revolving credit facility with total commitments of €193.6 million (€4.5 million of which has
been utilized as ancillary facilities) (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) comprising (i) a tranche in an aggregate
principal amount of €8.9 million which matures on the Original Maturity Date (“RCF1”) and (ii) a tranche in an
aggregate principal amount of €184.7 million to be established and made available pursuant to the ARA upon the
occurrence of the A&E Effective Date which matures on the Extended Maturity Date (“RCF2”).

Following the A&E Effective Date, each of Facility A6 and RCF2 will have an extended maturity date of June 30,
2029 (subject to a springing maturity to October 29, 2027, if the 2028 Notes are not refinanced in full on or prior to October
29, 2027) (the “Extended Maturity Date”).

If the Company and a lender under the Revolving Credit Facility agrees, a lender under the Revolving Credit Facility
may provide all or part of its Revolving Credit Facility commitments as an Ancillary Facility (as defined under the Senior
Facilities Agreement) on such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the Company and the relevant lender thereunder.
Such Ancillary Facility can be in the form of, among others, overdraft facility, guarantee or bonding facility, letter of credit or
any other facility or accommodation required in connection with the business. Ancillary Facilities may not be available for
cash drawings.

_Interest rates and fees_

The interest rate on each loan under the Senior Facilities Agreement for each interest period is the rate per annum
which is the aggregate of the applicable (a) margin (as described below) and (b) in relation to any loan in euro, EURIBOR.

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and following the A&E Effective Date, the margin for (i)
Facility A1 and RCF1 ranges from 1.80% to 2.50% per annum, and (ii) Facility A6 and RCF2 ranges from 2.50% per annum
to 4.00% per annum, in each case subject to a margin adjustment mechanism in the Senior Facilities Agreement pursuant to
which the margin applicable to Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility is adjusted upwards or downwards based on the
ratio of Net Financial Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) in respect of any
relevant testing period, as demonstrated in the compliance certificate required delivered with the annual audited and quarterly
unaudited financial statements of the Group. While an event of default is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
applicable margin will be the highest margin applicable to each Facility. In addition, the margin for RCF1 and RCF2 is subject
to a separate margin adjustment mechanism whereby the margin can be adjusted upwards or downwards by, in each case,
0.025% per annum (but, in each case, will never be reduced or increased by more than 0.025% per annum) based on the

122


-----

compliance or non-compliance with certain sustainability performance indicators as set out in the Group’s non-financial annual
report (the relevant provisions in the Senior Facilities Agreement being the “Sustainability Provisions”). The Company may,
by agreement with the relevant lenders under RCF1 or RCF2 (as applicable), amend the applicable Sustainability Provisions
from time to time, which may make these more difficult to meet in the future.

Pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay certain fees, including an agency and
security agent’s fee and a commitment fee in respect of the available but undrawn Revolving Credit Facility commitments.

_Guarantees_

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company
(together with the Company, the “SFA Guarantors”) guarantee all amounts due to the lenders and other finance parties under
the Senior Facilities Agreement and related finance documents. The guarantees granted by the SFA Guarantors are subject to
certain guarantee limitations which are set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement, or in the case of the Portuguese Guarantors,
in the Intercreditor Agreement. These guarantee limitations primarily limit the scope of the guarantees granted by the SFA
Guarantors to ensure that they comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in which the SFA Guarantors are incorporated.

The Company is required to ensure that each of its subsidiaries in which it holds directly or indirectly at least 90% of
the issued ordinary share capital, and which for the last financial year has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization (i) calculated on the same basis as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) but on an
unconsolidated basis, representing 2.50% or more of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement); and (ii) (calculated on the same basis as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) but on
an unconsolidated basis) greater than €5,000,000 (a company meeting these criteria being a “Material Company”), accedes
to the Senior Facilities Agreement as an additional guarantor as soon as possible after becoming a Material Company. The
obligation to require such a Material Company to accede as a guarantor is subject to agreed security principles and certain
limitations specified in the Senior Facilities Agreement and does not apply to a Spanish company established as an Agrupación
_de Interés Económico or a Sociedad de responsabilidad limitada or any subsidiary incorporated in Argentina, China, Costa_
Rica, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, Morocco, Romania, Russia, South Korea, South Africa, Thailand or Vietnam.

Any subsidiary of the Company that becomes a guarantor in respect of the 2028 Notes is also required to accede to
the Senior Facilities Agreement as a guarantor.

_Security_

HoldCo has granted Spanish law pledges over the issued share capital of the Company held by it (comprising 100%
of the entire issued share capital of the Company) (as extended and/or ratified from time to time, the “First Share Pledges”).

Castilfalé Gestión, S.A.U. has granted Spanish law pledges over the issued share capital of the Company held by it
(comprising 32.6% of the entire issued share capital of the Company) (as extended and/or ratified from time to time, the
“Second Share Pledges”). In 2020, Castilfalé Gestión, S.A.U. was merged into HoldCo and as of the date hereof the entire
issued share capital of the Company is held by HoldCo. The Second Share Pledges over the shares held by Castilfalé
Gestión, S.A.U. remain effective and the obligations under the corresponding security documents relating to such shares are
legal, valid, binding and enforceable against HoldCo following such merger.

The First Share Pledges and the Second Share Pledges secure obligations owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement
and related finance documents and the 2028 Notes.

The security created by the First Share Pledges and the Second Share Pledges rank in the order described in the section
titled “Intercreditor Agreement” below.

_Undertakings_

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that, subject to certain customary and other
agreed exceptions, limit the ability of each obligor (and in certain cases, members of the Group) to, among others:

    - incur or allow remaining outstanding financial indebtedness (with the capacity to incur indebtedness to be
increased by an additional €50 million pursuant to the A&E on the A&E Effective Date);

the avoidance of doubt, any amount that would have been permitted to be paid as dividend under the Senior
Facilities Agreement but for the 2024 Restriction shall be permitted to be paid in subsequent financial years falling
after December 31, 2026 as long as no Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) is

Each loan under the Revolving Credit Facility is required to be repaid on the last day of each interest period; provided,
_however, that Revolving Credit Facility loans may be redrawn subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Senior Facilities_
Agreement. All outstanding loans under RCF1 and any outstanding letters of credit under RCF1 are required to be repaid in
full on the Original Maturity Date and all outstanding loans under RCF2 and any outstanding letters of credit under RCF2 are
required to be repaid in full on the Extended Maturity Date.

_Prepayments_

Subject to certain conditions, the Company or the other borrowers under the Senior Facilities Agreement may
voluntarily cancel any available commitments under, or voluntarily prepay any outstanding utilizations of, the Senior Facilities
by giving three business days’ prior notice to the Agent. Any Facility A loans that are prepaid may not be reborrowed and the
relevant commitments will be canceled. Any Revolving Credit Facility utilizations that are prepaid may (subject to the terms
of the Senior Facilities Agreement) be reborrowed.

Subject to certain exceptions and/or thresholds, mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding under the Senior
Facilities are required to be made upon the disposal of certain categories of assets, recovery of insurance claim proceeds or a
flotation (which does not cause a change of control of the Company).

A change of control of the Company will trigger a 30 day consultation period with the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. At the end of such consultation period, each lender who does not wish to continue being a lender under
the Senior Facilities Agreement may request prepayment of all amounts owed to it. Any lender who makes such a request must
be prepaid within five business days and all of such lender’s commitments will be canceled. The Senior Facilities will be
automatically canceled and be immediately repayable upon a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Group to a third
party.

A “change of control” for these purposes means the Investors (being the Principals and any Related Party, each as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) ceasing to directly or indirectly (a) have the power to (i) cast, or control the casting
of, at least 50.01% of the votes that may be cast in a general meeting of the Company; (ii) appoint or remove all, or the majority
of the directors or equivalent officers of the Company; or (iii) give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies
of the Company with which the directors or equivalent officers are obliged to comply; or (b) hold beneficially at least 50.01%
of the issued share capital of the Company with voting rights.

_Events of default_

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains events of default customary for financings of this nature (with customary
and agreed thresholds and carve-outs), the occurrence of any of which will allow the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement to cancel available commitments under the Senior Facilities, declare all amounts owed under the Senior Facilities

125


-----

Agreement to be due upon demand and/or demand immediate repayment of all amounts owed under the Senior Facilities
Agreement.

**EIB Facilities**

The Company has also entered into (i) a bilateral finance contract with the European Investment Bank dated June 12,
2018, as amended and restated on July 29, 2020, in connection with a term loan facility of €100 million with an amortizing
repayment profile (“EIB Facility”) and (ii) a further finance contract with the European Investment Bank dated December 23,
2020, regarding an incremental term loan facility of €40 million with an amortizing repayment profile (the “EIB Incremental
**Facility”, together with the EIB Facility, the “EIB Facilities”). On March 23, 2023, the financial ratios under the EIB Facilities**
were amended.

The EIB Facilities bear interest semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate, are guaranteed by the Guarantors and will
mature on May 31, 2028 (in respect of the EIB Facility) and on June 30, 2028 (in respect of the EIB Incremental Facility). The
EIB Facilities rank _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is not_
subordinated to the EIB Facilities, including the 2028 Notes, the Notes, the Senior Facilities and the COFIDES Facility. The
EIB Facilities constitute “Senior Secured Debt” under the Intercreditor Agreement and are therefore governed by terms
substantially similar as those set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement. As of March 31, 2024, €94.3 million remain
outstanding under the EIB Facilities.

**COFIDES Facility**

On July 28, 2021, the Company entered into a credit and guarantee agreement with Compañía Española de
Financiación del Desarrollo, S.A., S.M.E. (“COFIDES”) as lender (the “COFIDES Facility Agreement”), pursuant to which
€10.0 million bilateral loan with an amortizing repayment profile was made available to the Company as borrower (the
“COFIDES Facility”). On November 2, 2022, the financial ratios under the COFIDES Facility were amended.

The COFIDES Facility bears interest semi-annually in arrears at a floating rate, is guaranteed by the Guarantors and
will mature on June 20, 2026. The COFIDES Facility ranks _pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future_
indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated to the COFIDES Facility, including the 2028 Notes, the Notes, the Senior
Facilities and the EIB Facilities. The COFIDES Facility constitutes “Senior Secured Debt” under the Intercreditor Agreement
and is therefore governed by terms substantially similar as those set forth in the Senior Facilities Agreement. As of March 31,
2024, €8.6 million remain outstanding under the COFIDES Facility.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

The Company (including, in its capacity as the issuer), the SFA Guarantors, the trustee in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement), the Agent, the Security Agent, the lenders under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the EIB and certain other parties have entered into the Intercreditor Agreement to establish the relative rights of
certain of the Group’s creditors including creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the indenture governing the Senior
Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Financings (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

The Intercreditor Agreement sets out:

    - the ranking of the indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes and any
Additional Senior Financing (together the “Senior Secured Debt” and the creditors to whom the Senior Secured
Debt is owed being the “Senior Secured Creditors”);

    - the ranking of the security created pursuant to the Transaction Security (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement);

    - the procedure for enforcement of the Transaction Security and any guarantees granted in favor of the Senior
Secured Creditors and the allocation of proceeds resulting from such enforcement;

    - the types of disposals permitted under distressed scenarios and the Security Agent’s authority to release the
Transaction Security and all obligations of the group owed to the Senior Secured Creditors in case of a distressed
disposal;

126


-----

    - the terms pursuant to which intra-Group debt and certain debt owed to equity investors (“Equity Investor
**Liabilities”) will be subordinated; and**

    - turnover provisions.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not
restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety.

_Priority of debts_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that all liabilities owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Additional Senior Financing (including in each case, any liabilities owed pursuant to any guarantees
given in respect of such debt) will rank pari passu and without any preference between them and in priority to any intra-Group
debt and Equity Investor Liabilities.

_Ranking of security_

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Transaction Security shall rank and secure the Senior Secured Debt as
follows:

(a) first, security created pursuant to the First Share Pledge and Second Share Pledge which security secure the
Senior Facility Liabilities and the Senior Secured Notes Liabilities (each term, as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) pari passu and without any preference between them; and

(b) second, security created pursuant to the First Share Pledges, the Second Share Pledges and any security
created pursuant to share pledges granted in favor of lenders of ancillary facilities entered into under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and creditors of any Additional Senior Financing after the original date of the
First Share Pledges and the Second Share Pledges in the order of priority in which they are entered into in
respect of any Additional Senior Financing Liabilities (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

Notwithstanding the order of ranking set out above, the date of execution or order the Transaction Security documents
are entered into, or the ranking under applicable law, it is agreed that the Transaction Security shall rank and secure the Senior
Secured Debt pari passu without preference between the different categories of Senior Secured Debt.

_Enforcement and application of proceeds_

The Intercreditor Agreement sets forth procedures for enforcement of the Transaction Security. Subject to the
Transaction Security having become enforceable, Senior Secured Creditors whose Senior Credit Participations aggregate more
than 50% of the total Senior Credit Participations (the “Instructing Group”) are entitled to direct the Security Agent to enforce
or refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security, as they see fit. The Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the
Transaction Security unless otherwise instructed by the Instructing Group. For these purposes, “Senior Credit Participations”
means at any time in relation to a Senior Secured Creditor, the aggregate amount owed to such Senior Secured Creditor.

The proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or any guarantees granted in respect of the Senior Secured
Debt and all other amounts paid to the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be applied in the following
order:

    - first, in payment on a pari passu and pro rata basis any sums (including fees, costs, expenses and liabilities)
owing to (i) the Security Agent or any receiver, delegate, attorney or agent appointed under the Transaction
Security documents or the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) the Agent or any creditor representative in its capacity as
such in respect of any Additional Senior Financing; and (iii) the trustee(s) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes;

    - second, on a pari passu and pro rata basis to the (i) Agent on its own behalf and on behalf of the creditors under
the Senior Facilities Agreement; (ii) the trustee(s) on their own behalf and on behalf of the relevant noteholders
of the Senior Secured Notes; and (iii) any creditor representative in respect of an Additional Senior Financing on
its own behalf and on behalf of the creditors under such Additional Senior Financing, for application towards the
discharge of amounts owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement (in accordance with the terms thereof), and any
Additional Senior Financing (on a pro rata basis);

127


-----

    - third, if none of the debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any of the Senior Secured
Debt documents, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any debtor; and

    - fourth, in payment or distribution to the relevant debtors.

_Distressed disposals_

A “Distressed Disposal” means a disposal effected (i) by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security; (ii) at the
request of the Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (iii) by HoldCo
(in the case of a disposal of the secured shares) or a debtor to a third party (not being a member of the Group) after any of the
Senior Secured Debt has been accelerated.

If to the extent permitted by applicable law a Distressed Disposal is being effected or the shares of the Company are
being appropriated by the Security Agent, the Security Agent is authorized (without the requirement to obtain any further
consent or authorization from any Senior Secured Creditor or other relevant party): (i) to release the Transaction Security or
any other claim over any asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or appropriation; and (ii) if the asset subject to the Distressed
Disposal or appropriation is the shares of a Group company, to release such Group Company and/or its subsidiaries from any
liabilities under borrowings and/or guarantees under the Senior Secured Debt documents, intra-Group debt documents or
documents evidencing Equity Investor Liabilities.

_Intra-Group debt_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries party thereto that are creditors in respect of
intra-Group debt over a certain threshold have agreed to subordinate intra-Group debt to the Senior Secured Debt.

Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries that are creditors in respect of intra-Group debt may accept the benefit
of any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of intra-Group debt unless such action is
permitted under the Senior Secured Debt documents. Neither the Company nor any other subsidiary may make any payment,
prepayment, repayment or otherwise acquire or discharge any intra-Group debt if acceleration action has been taken in respect
of any of the Senior Secured Debt unless the Instructing Group consent or such action is undertaken to facilitate repayment or
prepayment of the Senior Secured Debt.

_Equity Investor Liabilities_

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Company and future equity investors party thereto have agreed to
subordinate the Equity Investor Liabilities to the Senior Secured Debt. The Company and other debtors may make payments
in respect of the Equity Investor Liabilities provided that such payments are permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured
Debt documents and the documents evidencing the Equity Investor Liabilities. No equity investor may accept the benefit of
any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of Equity Investor Liabilities prior to the first date
on which all of the Senior Secured Debt has been discharged.

_Turnover_

Subject to certain exceptions, if any creditor party to the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Agent, Security Agent,
the Trustee (including the trustees under the Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture, respectively), Senior Secured Creditors,
creditors in respect of intra-Group debt and creditors in respect of Equity Investor Liabilities) receives or recovers a payment
(whether by way of direct payment, set-off or otherwise) except as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, such creditor shall hold such payment in trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay over such amounts to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provision described above under “Enforcement and application of
proceeds”.

principal amount of €9.7 million of the 2028 Notes was repurchased by the Company pursuant to an open market transaction
in July 2022 and, as a result, an aggregate principal amount of €380.3 million of the 2028 Notes remain outstanding as of the

128


-----

date of this Offering Memorandum. The 2028 Notes are admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for
trading on the Euro MTF Market. The 2028 Notes are senior obligations of the Company and are guaranteed jointly and
severally, on a senior secured basis by each of the Guarantors and the Company.

_Interest Rate_

The 2028 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.500% per annum and mature on April 30, 2028. Interest on the 2028
Notes is payable in cash semi-annually on April 30 and October 31 of each year, commencing October 31, 2021.

_Prepayments and redemptions_

At any time prior to April 30, 2024, the Company may redeem all or part of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes redeemed plus a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any.

At any time on or after April 30, 2024, the Company may redeem all or part of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price
(expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, at the
redemption date. The redemption prices are 101.7500%, 100.8750% and 100.000%, for years 2024, 2025 and 2026 and
thereafter, respectively.

At any time prior to April 30, 2024, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the
2028 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 103.500% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date, provided that at least 60% of
the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes remains outstanding after the redemption.

The Company may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, if changes in tax laws would require
the Company to pay additional amounts on the 2028 Notes. If the Company decides to redeem the 2028 Notes following such
a change in tax laws, the Company must redeem all the 2028 Notes at a price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.

If the Company experiences specific kinds of changes in control specified in the 2028 Notes Indenture, it may be
required to offer to repurchase the 2028 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any.

_Certain covenants and Events of Default_

The 2028 Notes Indenture contains a number of covenants that, among others, restricts, subject to certain exceptions,
our ability to:

    - incur additional indebtedness

    - create liens;

    - pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments;

    - enter into agreements that restrict dividends from restricted subsidiaries;

    - sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;

    - engage in transactions with affiliates; and

    - effect a consolidation or merger.

These covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions and will be suspended with respect
to the 2028 Notes if and when, and for so long as, the 2028 Notes are rated investment grade. In addition, the 2028 Notes
Indenture imposes certain requirements as to future subsidiary guarantors, and also contains certain customary events of default.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

You can find the definitions of certain terms used in this description under the subheading “Certain Definitions.” Certain
capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Notes” may have different definitions than the same term used in other sections
of this Offering Memorandum. For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Company” are to Grupo
Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and not to any of its subsidiaries, and references to “HoldCo” are to Grupo Antolin HoldCo, S.A.

The Company will issue €250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) under an
Indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated, 2024, among the Company, the Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company
Limited, as the trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (in such capacity,
the “Security Agent”), paying agent and transfer agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar, in a private
transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include
any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. See “Notice to Investors.” The terms of the Notes
will be subject to the provisions of the Indenture.

The proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be used by the Company, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem or
repurchase the entire outstanding amount of the €250.0 million 3.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”)
issued by the Company and (ii) to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, in each case as
set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.”

The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Company and will be guaranteed (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date
Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB
Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, and (ii) within 120 days from the Issue Date, by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of
which will also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the
COFIDES Facility, in each case on a senior basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the guarantee limitations described
herein, in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and in “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.”

The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements, and in
the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of the
Group’s indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking
enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor
_Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The following description is a summary of the_
material provisions of the Indenture and certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. It does not restate the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety. We urge you to read the Indenture because it, along with the Intercreditor
Agreement, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of the notes. Copies of the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement are available upon request as set forth under “Where You Can Find More Information.”

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under
the Indenture.

Application will be made to list the Notes on the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to trade on the Euro MTF
Market of that exchange. The Company may also choose to list on another recognized stock exchange.

For purposes of any covenant summarized herein, any reference to an amount in “€” shall mean, in respect of any amount in
any currency other than euro, the Euro Equivalent thereof.

**Brief Description of the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement**

The Notes will be guaranteed (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the Company’s
obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, and (ii) within 120 days
from the Issue Date, by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which will also guarantee the Company’s obligations under
the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, in each case on a senior basis, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, the guarantee limitations described herein, in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and
in “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime”. In the future, the Notes may be guaranteed by further of the
Company’s Restricted Subsidiaries. A Note Guarantee given by a Guarantor may be released in certain circumstances described
herein.

130


-----

**_The Notes_**

The Notes will:

- be general senior obligations of the Company;

- be secured by a pledge over the shares of the Capital Stock of the Company, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated
to the Notes, including the Existing Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future obligations of the Company that are expressly subordinated
to the Notes;

- be structurally subordinated to all Indebtedness, other obligations and claims of holders of preferred stock of the
Company’s subsidiaries that are not Guarantors;

- be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future obligations that are secured by property or
assets of the Company, to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such obligations, unless such
property or assets also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or priority basis;

- be fully and unconditionally guaranteed (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee
the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility,
and (ii) within 120 days from the Issue Date, by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which will also guarantee
the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility,
in each case on a senior basis as described under “—The Note Guarantees”, subject to the Agreed Security Principles,
the guarantee limitations described herein, in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and in “Enforceability of
_Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime”; and_

- mature on, 2030.

**The Note Guarantees**

Each Note Guarantee will:

- be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor;

- rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated
to that Guarantor’s Note Guarantee, including the Existing Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the
COFIDES Facility;

- rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated
in right of payment to that Guarantor’s Note Guarantee;

- be effectively subordinated to that Guarantor’s existing and future obligations that are secured by property or assets
of such Guarantor to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such obligations unless such property
or assets also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or priority basis;

- be structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of any of that Guarantor’s subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes; and

- be subject to limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of
_Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.”_

As of the Issue Date, all of the Company’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries”. However, under the circumstances
described below under the subheading “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”, the
Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. The Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture.

131


-----

Not all of our Subsidiaries will initially guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any
non-guarantor Subsidiaries, these Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be
able to distribute any of their assets to the Company.

The Guarantors will consist of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico,
Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, which will guarantee the Notes from the Issue Date. The
guarantee of the Notes by any Guarantor incorporated in Portugal will not be included in the Indenture and will instead be
granted pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Guarantors include both operating companies and various intermediate
holding companies. The Guarantors, together with the Company, represent 54.3% and 64.2% of the Group’s total Consolidated
EBITDA and revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Company
that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €21.8 million of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024 on a consolidated
basis, as adjusted for the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”.

In addition, pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Additional Note Guarantees”, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Agreed Security Principles and certain exceptions, any Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees certain Indebtedness of other
entities will also be required to enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Note Guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually
limited under the applicable Note Guarantee pursuant to the guarantee limitations and the Agreed Security Principles and in
order to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general
partners. In addition, the guarantees of Grupo Antolín Lusitânia-Componentes Automóvel Unipessoal LDA under the
Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility will be limited to an aggregate
of €17.8 million. For a description of such limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of
_Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.”_

The Agreed Security Principles impact and determine the extent of the guarantees and security to be provided in favor of the
obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include, among others, restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among others, such guarantee would be limited by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalization” rules, capital
maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, or where the time and cost of granting the guarantee would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes.

**Release of Note Guarantees**

The Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and be released:

(1) in connection with any direct or indirect sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that
Guarantor (including by way of merger, consolidation, amalgamation or combination) to a Person that is not (either
before or after giving effect to such transaction) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, if the sale or other
disposition does not violate the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of the Guarantor with
respect to Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities are also released;

(2) in connection with any sale directly or indirectly through the sale of a Parent Company of such Guarantor, of any
Capital Stock of that Guarantor, as a result of which such Guarantor would no longer be a Restricted Subsidiary, if
the sale complies with the “Asset Sale” provisions of the Indenture, and all obligations of the Guarantor with respect
to Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities are also released;

(3) if the Company designates that Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Indenture;

(4) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes as described under the captions “—Legal
_Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) as described under the caption “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

132


-----

(6) in the case of a Note Guarantee granted pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Additional Note Guarantees”, upon the
discharge of the Indebtedness or the release and discharge of the guarantee that gave rise to the obligation to guarantee
the Notes;

(7) in accordance with an enforcement action pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement;

(8) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization; or

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation
_or Sale of Assets.”_

See “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries”.

Substantially all the operations of the Company are conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims of creditors of Subsidiaries that
are not Guarantors, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and guarantees issued by those
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, and claims of preferred equity holders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have
priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Company and the
Guarantors, including the holders of the Notes. The Notes and each Notes Guarantee will therefore be effectively subordinated
to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred equity holders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Company that are not
Guarantors. Although the Indenture will limit the incurrence of Indebtedness by Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors, the
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Indenture does not impose any limitation on the
incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
under the Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified
_Stock”._

**Security**

**_The Collateral_**

Pursuant to the Security Documents, the Notes will be secured by a pledge numerically successive to the pledges securing the
existing senior secured debt over all of the shares of capital stock of the Company held by HoldCo (together with any additional
property or assets securing the Notes or the Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Additional
_Note Guarantees,” the “Collateral”). Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received upon_
enforcement over Collateral will be applied (subject to certain claims of the Trustee, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as
trustee under the Existing Notes (the “Existing Notes Trustee”), the Security Agent, the Facility Agent under the Senior
Facilities and costs and expenses related to the enforcement of the Collateral) pro rata in repayment of liabilities in respect of
(i) obligations under the Indenture and the Notes, (ii) obligations under the indenture dated as of June 29, 2021 by and between,
among others, the Company, the Existing Trustee and the Security Agent, pursuant to which the Existing Notes were issued
(the “Existing Notes Indenture”) and the Existing Notes, (iii) obligations under the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the
COFIDES Facility and (iv) any other Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred
and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities and the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The pledge over the shares of capital stock of the Company held by HoldCo will be executed within 120 days from the Issue
Date. The Company has agreed to take all necessary actions to perfect and make effective the security interest in favor of the
Security Agent (for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, among others) in the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents
and to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement as soon as practicable.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Liens”, the
Company is permitted to pledge or cause its Subsidiaries or HoldCo to pledge the Collateral in connection with future
incurrence of Indebtedness, including issuances of Additional Notes, permitted under the Indenture on a pari passu basis with
the then outstanding Notes. The Collateral can also be released from the Liens of the Security Documents under certain
circumstances. See “—Release of Security Interests” below. All security interests in the Collateral will be subject to the
limitations that are applicable to Notes Guarantees granted by the same entity, the operation of the Agreed Security Principles
and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

133


-----

**_Administration of Collateral and Enforcement of Liens_**

The Collateral will be administered by a Security Agent pursuant to the terms of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement for the benefit of all holders of the Existing Notes and the Notes, the finance parties under the Senior Facilities, the
EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, and certain other future secured creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.
For a description of the Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

The ability of holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral will be subject to various bankruptcy law limitations in the
event of the HoldCo’s bankruptcy and various limitations on enforcement contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.”_

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since the holders
of the Notes are not a party to the Security Documents, holders may not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to
enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders may only act through the Security Agent. The
Security Agent will agree to any release of the security interest created by the Security Documents in accordance with terms of
the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement without requiring any consent of the holders of the Notes. Subject to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, share in or have the ability to direct the
Trustee to direct the Security Agent to commence enforcement action under the Security Documents. However, in enforcing
the Liens provided for under the Security Documents, the Security Agent will take direction from the Trustee (subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement). Please see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.

Subject to the terms of the Security Documents, until the acceleration of amounts due under the Notes in accordance with the
Indenture, HoldCo will be entitled to exercise any and all voting rights in a manner which does not materially adversely affect
the validity or enforceability of the Liens created under the Security Documents or the value of the Collateral and to receive
and retain any and all cash dividends, stock dividends, liquidating dividends, non-cash dividends, shares of stock resulting from
stock splits or reclassifications, rights issue, warrants, options and other distribution (whether similar or dissimilar to the
foregoing) in respect of the shares that are part of the Collateral.

The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Existing Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy the Company’s obligations
under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under their Note Guarantees, and the Collateral may be reduced or diluted
under certain circumstances, including the issuance of Additional Notes or other future incurrences of Indebtedness and the
disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, subject to the terms of the Indenture.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Company or the Guarantors in connection with this
offering of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the proceeds of any sale of Collateral, in whole or in part, pursuant to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents following an Event of Default, would be sufficient to satisfy the amounts
due on the Notes or the Note Guarantees. By its nature, all of the Collateral is likely to be illiquid and may have no readily
ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral would be sold in a timely manner or at
all.

The Security Documents will be governed by Spanish law and will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Spanish courts. The
Trustee for the Notes has, and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have:

- irrevocably appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the other relevant documents to which it is a party (including, without limitation, the
Security Documents);

- irrevocably authorized the Security Agent (i) to perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that
are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other documents to which it is a party (including,
without limitation, the Security Documents), together with any other incidental rights, powers and discretions; and (ii)
execute each document, waiver, modification, amendment, renewal or replacement expressed to be executed by the
Security Agent on its behalf; and

- accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as
defined below) and each holder of the Notes will also be deemed to have authorized the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

134


-----

**_Release of Security Interests_**

All of the Liens granted under the Security Documents will be automatically and unconditionally released in accordance with
the terms and conditions in the Indenture upon Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as described under “—Legal
_Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance”, if all obligations under the Indenture are discharged in accordance with the terms of_
the Indenture or as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture, including but not limited to the covenants under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest”, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement._

The Liens on the Collateral granted in the Security Documents will be released:

(1) to the extent that such Collateral is sold, directly or indirectly, or otherwise disposed of pursuant to an enforcement of
the security over such Collateral under the applicable Security Document(s) in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee (with respect to the Lien securing such Note
Guarantee granted by such Guarantor);

(3) if the Company designates any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property, assets and Capital Stock of such Restricted
Subsidiary;

(4) upon legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or discharge of the Notes as described under the captions “—Legal
_Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

(5) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”;

(6) as otherwise permitted and in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture; or

(7) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

The Security Agent will take all reasonable action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes, in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document. Each of
the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders of the Notes or any action
on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release).

**_Intercreditor Agreement_**

On the Issue Date, the Trustee will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as described under “Description of Other
_Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”. The Collateral will be administered by a Security Agent pursuant to the terms of the_
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement for the benefit of all holders of the Existing Notes, the Notes and the
finance parties under the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility and certain other future secured
creditors pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received
upon enforcement over Collateral will be applied (subject to certain claims of the Trustee, the Existing Notes Trustee, the
Security Agent, the Facility Agent under the Senior Facilities and costs and expenses related to the enforcement of the
Collateral) pro rata in repayment of liabilities in respect of (i) obligations under the Indenture and the Notes, (ii) obligations
under the Existing Notes Indenture and the Existing Notes, (iii) obligations under the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and
the COFIDES Facility and (iv) any other Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries permitted to be incurred
and secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Indenture, the Existing Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Trustee, the Existing Notes Trustee and the creditors under the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES
Facility and the other secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement have, and by accepting a Note, each holder of a Note
will be deemed to have, irrevocably appointed Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as Security Agent to act as its security agent
under the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes, the Indenture, and the Security Documents (together, the “Finance Documents”).
The Trustee, the Existing Notes Trustee, the creditors under the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility
and the other secured parties under the Intercreditor Agreement will have, and by accepting a Note, each holder of a Note will
be deemed to have, irrevocably authorized the Security Agent to perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and
discretions that are specifically given to it under the Intercreditor Agreement or other Finance Documents, together with any
incidental rights, power and discretions.

**Additional Notes**

From time to time, subject to compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens,” the Company is_
permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the
following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s Certificate delivered by the Company to the Trustee (“Additional
_Notes”):_

(1) the title of such Additional Notes;

(2) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes to be authenticated and delivered pursuant to the Indenture;

(3) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued and will mature;

(4) the rate or rates at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest and, with respect to Additional Notes with floating
interest, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or rates, the date or dates
from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which such interest shall be payable or the method
by which such dates will be determined, the record dates for the determination of holders thereof to whom such interest
is payable and the basis upon which such interest will be calculated;

(5) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in which cash or
government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be payable;

(6) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon
which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(7) in the case of Additional Notes with a floating interest rate, the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period
or periods within which, and the terms and conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole
or in part;

(8) if other than in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, the denominations in
which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(9) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such Additional Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other Notes, as a single class for the purposes of the Indenture with respect
to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically distinguished for such series. Unless the context
otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Notes”, references to “Notes” shall be deemed
to include references to the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes. Additional Notes may also
be designated to be of the same series as the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, but only if they have terms substantially
identical in all material respects to such initial Notes. However, in order for any Additional Notes to have the same ISIN or
common code, as applicable, as the Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such Additional Notes must be fungible with the
initial Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest and Payment of Notes**

The Company will issue Notes in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. For
so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF Market,
the Company will publish a notice of any change in these denominations in accordance with the requirements of such rules.
The Notes will mature on, 2030.

Interest on the Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum and will be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on
and, commencing on, 2025. The Company will make each interest payment to the holders of record on
the Business Day immediately preceding the relevant interest payment date. The reimbursement price of the Notes at maturity
will be 100% of the principal amount then outstanding.

Interest on the Notes will accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

136


-----

Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant interest payment date.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes**

Payments of principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes will be made by one or more Paying
Agents (on behalf of the Issuer and subject to the terms of the Indenture) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account specified by the registered holder thereof (initially being the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and
Clearstream).

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Notes to receive payments on such Notes are subject to applicable procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next
succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such
delay.

Principal, interest and premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”)
will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents. In addition, interest on the Definitive Registered
Notes may be paid, at the option of the Company, by check mailed to the address of the holder entitled thereto as shown on the
register of holders for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes.”

Payments in respect of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on Definitive Registered Notes are subject in all cases to any
tax or other laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment but without prejudice to the provisions under the headings
“—Optional Tax Redemption” and “—Additional Amounts”.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Company will maintain one or more paying agents (each, a “Paying Agent”) for the Notes. The initial Paying Agent is
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The initial Transfer Agent is Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The Transfer Agent is
responsible for, among others, facilitating any transfers or exchanges of beneficial interests in different global notes and
Definitive Registered Notes between holders.

The Company also will maintain one or more registrars (each a “Registrar”). The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank
Luxembourg S.A. The Registrar will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes and the Global
Notes outstanding from time to time and will make payments on Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Company.

The Company may change the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar without prior notice to the holders. For so
long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF Market, the
Company will publish a notice of any change of Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar in accordance with the requirements
of such rules.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued in the form of global notes in registered form and will be issued in minimum denominations of
€100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000. The Notes will be serially numbered. In no event will Definitive
Registered Notes in bearer form be issued. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form”.

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made by the Company or any Guarantor (each a “Payor”) on the Notes or under or with respect to any Note
Guarantee will be made free and clear and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, assessments or similar governmental charges (including penalties, additions to tax, and interest related
thereto) (“Taxes”) unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding
for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Spain or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having power to tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on the Notes or a Note Guarantee is made, or any political subdivision
or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

137


-----

(3) any other jurisdiction in which any Payor is incorporated or organized or otherwise resident or doing business for tax
purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,
including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium (if any), the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in
respect of such payments by each beneficial owner of the Notes or the Note Guarantee, as the case may be, after such
withholding or deduction by any applicable withholding agent (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts), equal the amounts which would have been received in respect of such payments in the absence of such
withholding or deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on the account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the
relevant holder or the beneficial owner of a Note (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or shareholder
of, or possessor of power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction,
(including any Tax imposed as a result of a holder or beneficial owner being a citizen or resident or national or
domiciliary of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Personal Income Tax, the Corporate Income Tax or the Non-resident
Income Tax imposed by Spain as a result of such holder or beneficial owner being resident or doing business in
Spain)), other than a connection resulting from the mere acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Note or
enforcement of rights under or in respect of such Note or any Note Guarantee or the receipt of payments under or in
respect of such Note or any Note Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed if the holder or the beneficial owner of a Note had provided a
certification, declaration, claim, filing, information, document or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence
or identity of such holder or beneficial owner, which is required by applicable law, regulation, administrative practice
or treaty of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition or exemption from the requirement to deduct or
withhold all or a part of such Taxes, provided that the relevant holder or beneficial owner at that time has been notified,
at least 30 days prior to the payment date with respect to which a certification, declaration, claim, filing, information,
document or other evidence relates, by the Payor or any other Person through whom payment may be made, that such
certification, declaration claim, filing, information, document or other evidence is required to be provided, but, in each
case, only to the extent the holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible to provide such certification, declaration,
claim, filing, information, document or other evidence;

(3) any Note presented for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant payment is first
made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented during such 30-day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding in respect of a payment of the principal of, premium, if any,
interest or any other amounts under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes which could have been avoided by the presentation (where presentation is required) of the relevant Note to
another Paying Agent in the United Kingdom or a member state of the European Union;

(7) any Spanish Taxes imposed or withheld on payments to the holder or the beneficial owner of the Notes or Note
Guarantees as a result of a failure by the Paying Agent to deliver to the Company in a timely manner a duly executed
and completed Payment Statement from the Paying Agent, pursuant to Law 10/2014 and regulations approved by
Royal Decree 1065/2007, as amended, and any implementing legislation or regulation;

(8) any Taxes imposed on, or on a third party on behalf of, a Spanish-resident legal entity subject to Spanish Corporate
Income Tax if the taxing authorities of the Kingdom of Spain determine that the Notes do not comply with exemption
requirements specified in any applicable tax law, or its judicial or administrative interpretation, including the ruling
of the General Directorate of Taxation (Dirección General de Tributos) dated July 27, 2004, or any legislation or
regulation implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such applicable law or such ruling,
which law, ruling, legislation or regulation requires a withholding to be made;

138


-----

(9) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to Sections 1471-1474 of the U.S. Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the Issue Date (or any amended or successor version that is
substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), or any regulations or official
interpretations thereof, any similar law or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rule or practices adopted pursuant to any
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States implementing the foregoing or
any agreements entered into pursuant to current Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code (or any amended or successor version
described above); or

(10) any combination of (1) through (9) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to any payment to any holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
(or any other entity treated as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or other than the beneficial owner of such Notes to the
extent that the beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership (or any other entity treated
as a partnership for applicable tax purposes) or the beneficial owner of such Notes would not have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner held such Notes directly, but only if there is no material
cost or commercial or legal restriction to transferring the Notes to such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner.

The applicable withholding agent will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts or other documentary evidence, which is reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
(or holder), of the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes
and will provide such evidence to the Trustee (or a holder upon request). The Payor will attach to each piece of documentary
evidence a certificate stating that (x) the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy was paid in connection
with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the amount of such withholding Taxes paid
per €1,000 principal amount of Notes. Copies of such documentation will be available for inspection during ordinary business
hours at the office of the Trustee by the holders of the Notes upon request and will be made available at the offices of the
Paying Agent located in Luxembourg if the Notes are then listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
traded on the Euro MTF Market.

At least 30 days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee is due and
payable (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises shortly before or after the 30th day prior to such date, in
which case it shall be promptly thereafter), if the Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such
payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that such Additional Amounts will be
payable, the amounts so payable and will set forth such other information necessary to enable the Trustee to pay such Additional
Amounts to holders on the payment date. Each such Officer’s Certificate shall be relied upon until receipt of a further Officer’s
Certificate addressing such matters.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Note Guarantee or this “Description of the Notes” there are mentioned, in any
context:

(a) the payment of principal,

(b) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,

(c) interest, or

(d) any other amount payable on or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that,
in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property
or similar Taxes which arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, issuance, delivery, registration or
enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, any Note Guarantee or any other document or instrument referred to therein, or any
payments under or with respect to the Notes or any Note Guarantee, other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of
the Notes after the initial offering of the Notes and, solely to the extent of such Taxes that arise from the receipt of any payments
on the Notes, any such Taxes or similar charges or levies that would have been excluded under clauses (1) through (10) above
(other than clause (4)).

139


-----

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and any transfer by a holder
or beneficial owner of its Notes, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to a Payor and to any jurisdiction in which
such successor is incorporated, organized, doing business or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
jurisdiction from or through which such successor (or its paying agent) makes any payment under or with respect to the Notes
or any Note Guarantee and, in each case, including any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax (which will, if not already a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, be thereafter considered a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction).

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to, 2026, at the option of the Company, the Company may, upon giving not less than 10 nor more
than 60 days’ notice to the holders of the Notes, on any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal
amount of Notes issued under the Indenture at a redemption price of % of the principal amount thereof plus accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings;
_provided that:_

(1) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Indenture remain outstanding immediately
after the occurrence of such redemption (excluding Notes held by the Company and its Subsidiaries); and

(2) the redemption occurs within 120 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

Notice of any redemption upon any Equity Offering may be given prior to the completion thereof.

After, 2026 at the option of the Company, the Company may redeem all or a part of the Notes upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth below plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve
month period beginning on of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Percentage**
2026 ......................................................................................................................................... %
2027 ......................................................................................................................................... %
2028, and thereafter ................................................................................................................. 100.0000%

In addition, the Company may on or prior to, 2026 upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the
holders of the Notes, at its option on one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of the Notes (which includes Additional
Notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to the sum of:

(1) 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus

(2) accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, plus

(3) the Applicable Premium at the redemption date, subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on any interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date.

Any redemption and notice of redemption may be, at the Company’s discretion, subject to the satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent (including, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity Offering, the consummation of such Equity
Offering). In addition, if any redemption is subject to one or more conditions precedent, the notice of redemption in respect
thereof shall describe each such condition and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Company’s discretion, the redemption date
may be delayed (without the need for a new redemption notice) until such time (but not more than 60 days after the date the
notice of redemption was delivered) as any such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion),
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have
been satisfied (or waived by the Company in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed,
or such notice may be rescinded at any time in the Company’s discretion if in the good faith judgement of the Company any or
all of such conditions will not be satisfied. The Company will provide the Trustee written confirmation (i) when conditions are
satisfied or waived with respect to a new redemption date, in the event that a redemption is delayed in accordance with this
paragraph and (ii) if any redemption notice is rescinded.

140


-----

If the Company effects an optional redemption of the Notes, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and admitted for trading on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange so require, inform the Luxembourg Stock Exchange of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption by the Company.

The Company may repurchase Notes at any time and from time to time in the open market or otherwise.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Company is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Optional Tax Redemption**

The Company may redeem the Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice to the holders of the Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject
to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and
Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or
otherwise, if the Company determines that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above) which change or amendment is publicly announced and becomes
effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date
after the Issue Date, after such later date); or

(2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations or
rulings (including by virtue of a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in
published administrative practice) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, which change or amendment is publicly
announced and becomes effective after the Issue Date (or, if a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date);

the Company is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts,
and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to it (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new Paying Agent in accordance with the third paragraph under “Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes”
or payment through a Guarantor).

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection
_and Notice”. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 180 days prior to the_
earliest date on which the Company would be obliged to pay Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is
given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of
redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Company will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that the Company is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing
to the Trustee to the effect that the circumstances referred to above exist. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and
opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to the Company.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

If a Change of Control Triggering Event occurs, each holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase
all or any part (equal to €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of that holder’s Notes pursuant to a Change
of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture. In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a Change of
Control Payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of such repurchase. Within 60 days following any Change of Control
Triggering Event, the Company will mail a notice to each holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the

141


-----

Change of Control Triggering Event and offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the
notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations
are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes and the related Note Guarantees as a result of a Change of Control
Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control
provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or
portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating
the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Company.

The relevant Paying Agent will promptly mail to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for
such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new
Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each new Note will
be in a principal amount of €100,000 or, if greater, an integral multiple of €1,000.

The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control
Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described
above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders
of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar
transaction.

The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered
and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. The Company also will not be required to make a Change of Control
Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if it has theretofore issued a redemption notice in respect of all of the
Notes in the manner and in accordance with the provisions described under “—Optional Redemption” and thereafter purchases
all of the Notes pursuant to such notice.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control
Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the
Change of Control Triggering Event at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.

If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such
Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the
Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Company or
such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days
following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding
following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or
other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as
a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established
definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Company to repurchase
its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and
its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a holder of Notes may require the Company to make
an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

142


-----

Subject to the covenants described below, the Company could enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions,
refinancings or other recapitalizations which, though not constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event under the
Indenture, could increase the amount of outstanding debt or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings.
In addition, we may not be able to finance the payments required for a Change of Control Offer. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_related to the notes—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer”._

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a
Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Notes under the Indenture.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis, or
otherwise as required by law or mandatory requirements, rules or regulations of Euroclear and Clearstream, the principal
national securities exchange on which the Notes are listed or by such method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate.

No Notes may be redeemed in part such that the remainder of the Note is less than €100,000 in aggregate principal amount.
Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail at least 10 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to
each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture.

In addition, so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF
Market and its rules so require, all notices to holders of the Notes will also be supplied to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
[are expected to be published at www.bourse.lu. If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given in such](http://www.bourse.lu/)
other manner, and shall be deemed to have been given on such date, as the Trustee may approve. In the case of Definitive
Registered Notes, notices will be mailed to holders of the Notes by first class mail at their respective addresses as they appear
on the records of the Registrar. If and so long as the Notes are listed on any other securities exchange, notices will also be given
in accordance with any applicable requirements of such securities exchange. Notices given by publication will be deemed given
on the first date on which publication is made. Notices given by first class mail, postage paid, will be deemed given five
calendar days after mailing whether or not the addressee receives it.

For the Notes which are represented by Global Notes held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by
delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution of
the aforesaid mailing.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the portion of the principal
amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original
Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the original Note and will be collectible at the office
of the Paying Agent. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice (including any conditions contained therein),
Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the applicable redemption date, interest
ceases to accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption. If the redemption date is on or after an interest record date
and on or before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name
the Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to holders of the
Notes whose Notes will be subject to redemption by the Company.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Company or any Guarantor for the payment of principal of, or interest, premium, or Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes will become void unless presentation for payment is made as required in the Indenture within a period of
seven years, in the case of principal, or five years, in the case of interest, premium or Additional Amounts, if any, from the
applicable original payment date therefor.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Restricted Payments_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

143


-----

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company’s or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with any merger
or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or to the direct or indirect holders of the
Company’s or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than (A) dividends
or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company or Subordinated
Shareholder Debt, (B) dividends or distributions to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and (C) pro rata
dividends or distributions made by a Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary to minority
stockholders (or owners of any equivalent interest in the case of a Subsidiary that is an entity other than a corporation));

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in connection with any merger
or consolidation involving the Company) any Equity Interests of the Company or any Parent Company;

(3) make any payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value (x) any
Indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes or the Note Guarantees, except a payment of interest
or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or any purchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement
of principal within one year of the Stated Maturity thereof or (y) any Subordinated Shareholder Debt; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”),

unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(1) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted
Payment; and

(2) the Company would, after giving pro forma effect to such Restricted Payment (including the application thereof) as if
such Restricted Payment had been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted
to incur at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness (other than Permitted Debt) pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage

covenant will be determined by the responsible financial or accounting officer of the Company. The determination of such
responsible financial or accounting officer will be final and conclusive.

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue,
assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively,
“incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and the Company will not issue any Disqualified Stock and will not
permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Company and any
Restricted Subsidiary may incur Indebtedness, the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may incur Acquired Debt and the
Company may issue Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue shares of preferred stock, if the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock is issued would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application
of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock

146


-----

had been issued, as the case may be, at the beginning of such four-quarter period; provided that a Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company that is not a Guarantor may incur Indebtedness or issue Disqualified Stock or preferred stock pursuant to this
paragraph solely to the extent that the Non-Guarantor Leverage Ratio for the Company’s most recently ended four fiscal
quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such Indebtedness is
incurred or such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued, as the case may be, would have been no greater than 1.00 to
1.00, as determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if such
Indebtedness had been incurred or the Disqualified Stock or preferred stock had been issued, as the case may be, at the
beginning of such four-quarter period.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any of the
following items of Indebtedness (collectively, “Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness and letters of credit under

property, plant or equipment used in the business of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate
principal amount, including all Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to renew, refund, refinance, replace,

(5) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in
exchange for, or the net proceeds of which are used to refund, refinance or replace Indebtedness (other than

covenant or clauses (2), (3), (5) or (15) of this paragraph;

(6) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among

such Indebtedness must be unsecured and ((i) except in respect of intercompany liabilities incurred in
connection with cash management positions of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and (ii) only to
the extent legally permitted (the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries having completed all procedures
required in the reasonable judgment of the directors or officers of the oblige or obligor to protect such

Indebtedness) expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all Obligations with respect, in
any bankruptcy, insolvency or winding up of such obligor, to its Note Guarantee and, in the case of the
Company, its obligations under the Indenture, as applicable; and

by a Person other than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) any sale or other
transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company will be deemed, in each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the

(7) the incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Hedging Obligations that are incurred for the

or pari passu with the Notes or a Note Guarantee, then the guarantee must be expressly subordinated or pari passu,
as applicable, to the same extent as the Indebtedness being guaranteed;

(9) Indebtedness in respect of (a) self-insurance obligations, performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance

support by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness incurred by any Person acquiring such business,

contingent or otherwise, recourse to any property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (other
than the Receivables that are the subject of the factoring), or (b) if such Indebtedness has recourse to any property or
assets of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, only the portion of such Indebtedness that is not recourse

subject of the factoring) may be considered as “Permitted Debt” under this clause (13);

(14) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of guarantees of Indebtedness of Permitted Joint Ventures
in an amount not to exceed the greater of (x) €100 million and (y) 3.0% of Total Assets;

Company in accordance with the terms of the Indenture (“Acquired Debt”) and (b) Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock

148


-----

(i) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be permitted to incur at least €1.00 of additional
Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first sentence, of this covenant;
or
(ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is no less than immediately prior to such acquisition,
merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination;

(16) the incurrence by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of additional Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) in
an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding, including all Permitted
Refinancing Indebtedness incurred to refund, refinance or replace any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause
(16), not to exceed the greater of (a) €137 million and (b) 40% of Consolidated EBITDA; and

(d) Indebtedness incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in connection with bankers’ acceptances, discounted bills of
exchange or the discounting or factoring of receivables for credit management of bad debt purposes, in each case,
incurred or undertaken in the ordinary course of business.

To the extent any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor is a joint obligor with respect to any Indebtedness, the entire
amount of such Indebtedness shall be considered Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor for purposes
of this covenant.

The accrual of interest, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in
the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock in the form of
additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance
of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; provided that, in each such case, that the amount thereof is included in
Consolidated Interest Expense of the Company as accrued or paid in accordance with the definition of such term.

The incurrence by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Company of Non-Recourse Debt will not be deemed to be an incurrence
of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant; _provided, however, that if any such_
Indebtedness ceases to be Non-Recourse Debt of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Indebtedness shall be deemed to constitute
an incurrence of Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that was not permitted by this covenant.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the
criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (17) above, or is entitled to be
incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness
on the date of its incurrence, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with
this covenant.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations
in exchange rates or currency values. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if
Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange
rate applicable, to the currencies in which such refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro
Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency will be calculated based on the relevant
currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first

149


-----

committed, in the case of Indebtedness incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided that (1) if such Indebtedness is
incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euros, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable euro denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
of such refinancing, such euro denominated restriction will be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal
amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (2) the
Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date will be calculated based on
the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (3) if and for so long as any such Indebtedness is subject
to an agreement intended to protect against fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, if
denominated in euros, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under such currency agreement and,
otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable
but is not covered by such currency agreement.

**_Liens_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien of any kind upon any of its assets or property (including Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries),
whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which
Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except (a) in the case of any property or asset that does not
constitute Collateral, (1) Permitted Liens or (2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens if the Notes and the
Indenture (or a Note Guarantee in the case of Liens of a Guarantor) are directly secured equally and ratably with, or senior in
right of payment to, in the case of Liens with respect to subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial
Lien for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured, and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral,
Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any such Lien created in favor of the Notes pursuant to the preceding paragraph will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates and (ii) as otherwise set forth
under “—Security—Release of Security Interests”.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant and for purposes of the definitions of “Permitted Liens” and
“Permitted Collateral Liens”, in the event that a Lien meets the criteria of more than one of the categories or exceptions
contained in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or “Permitted Collateral Liens” (or any other definition used in this covenant
or such definitions), as applicable, the Company will be permitted to divide and classify such Lien in any manner that complies
with this covenant or such definition, and may later divide and/or reclassify any such Lien at any time and in any manner that
complies with this covenant or such definition.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist
or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits, or pay any indebtedness owed to
the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) make loans or advances to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(3) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

(1) agreements governing Existing Indebtedness and Credit Facilities as in effect on the Issue Date and any amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those
agreements; provided that the amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacement or refinancings are no more restrictive, taken as a whole, with respect to such dividend and other payment
restrictions than those contained in those agreements on the Issue Date;

150


-----

(2) the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Documents or any agreement
related to the Transactions, and any notes and guarantees in connection with the subsequent issuance of debt securities

incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or restriction is not
applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of
the Person, so acquired; provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of
the Indenture to be incurred;

(5) customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices;

(6) purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business that impose restrictions on that
property of the nature described in clause (4) of the second paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of

Subsidiary pending its sale or other disposition;

(9) Liens securing Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred under the provisions of the covenant entitled “—
_Liens” that limit the right of the debtor to dispose of the assets subject to such Liens;_

and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to
the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities
and the COFIDES Facility as in effect on the Issue Date (as determined in good faith by the Company) or (ii) if the
encumbrances and restrictions are not materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than is customary

such encumbrance or restriction will not adversely affect the Company’s ability to make principal and interest
payments on the Notes as and when they come due or (y) such encumbrances and restrictions apply only during the
continuance of a default in respect of a payment or financial maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness, (B)
constituting an intercreditor agreement on terms substantially equivalent to the Intercreditor Agreement or (C) relating
to any loan or advance by the Company to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company subsequent to the Issue Date;
_provided that with respect to this clause (13) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or_
instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities, the COFIDES Facility, the Security Documents and
the Intercreditor Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date).

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

The Company may not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person; or (2) sell, assign, transfer,
convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person; unless:

(1) either: (a) the Company is the surviving corporation; or (b) the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation
or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
has been made (the “Surviving Entity”) is a corporation organized or existing under the laws of (i) Spain, (ii) any other
member of the European Union that has adopted the euro as its national currency, (iii) the United Kingdom or (iv) the
United States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia;

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than the Company) assumes all the obligations of the Company under the Notes, the
Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, pursuant to agreements satisfactory to the Trustee;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists or would exist; and

(4) the Company or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, will:

(a) on the date of such transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as
if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, either (i) be permitted to incur
at least €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the
first paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and
_Disqualified Stock” or (ii) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company (or, if applicable, the Surviving_
Entity) would equal or exceed the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately prior to giving
effect to such transaction; and

(b) deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case, stating that such
consolidation, merger or transfer and any supplemental indenture to be delivered in connection therewith
comply with this covenant and the Indenture, and, if the Company is not the surviving entity, that the
supplemental indenture executed in connection therewith is the legally valid and binding obligation of the
Successor Entity enforceable (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) in accordance with its terms.

In addition, the Company may not, directly or indirectly, lease all or substantially all of its properties or assets, in one or more
related transactions, to any other Person. This “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among the Company and any of the Guarantors.
Notwithstanding clause (4)(a) of the foregoing, the Company or any Guarantor may merge, consolidate or otherwise combine
with an Affiliate solely for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another
jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity.

A Guarantor may not sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets to, or consolidate with or merge with or
into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person) another Person, other than the Company or another Guarantor,
unless:

(1) immediately after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists; and

(2) either:

(a) the Person acquiring the property in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under the Indenture and its Note
Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee and the applicable Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(b) the net proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in accordance with the applicable provisions of
the Indenture; or

(c) in any transaction between (i) the Company or a Guarantor and (ii) a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor, the Company or such Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Restricted Subsidiary is the

152


-----

surviving Person and assumes all of the obligations of the Company or such Guarantor under the Indenture
and its Note Guarantee, as applicable, pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve “all or substantially
all” of the property or assets of a Person.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer
or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or
amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate
(each, an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of €10.0 million, unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those
that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an
unrelated Person; and

(2) the Company delivers to the Trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
involving aggregate consideration in excess of €25 million, a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company set
forth in an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the
prior paragraph:

(a) transactions between or among (i) the Company and/or (ii) its Restricted Subsidiaries;

(b) transactions with a Person (including any joint venture or equity investee) that is an Affiliate of the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary solely because the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in
such Person;

(c) payment of reasonable director’s and other fees to, indemnities provided on behalf of, and expenses
(including expense reimbursement, employee benefit and pension expenses) relating to, officers, directors,
employees or consultants of the Company or its Parent Company or the Company’s Subsidiaries and
payments of benefits and salaries to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of
business;

(d) issuances or sales of Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock) or Subordinated
Shareholder Debt to Affiliates of the Company;

(e) Permitted Investments or Restricted Payments that are permitted by the provisions of the Indenture described
above under the caption “—Restricted Payments” (other than Permitted Investments described in clauses (3),
(10), (11)(i), (13) and (15) of the definition of “Permitted Investments”);

(f) performance of any agreement of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary as in effect on the Issue Date and
disclosed in the Offering Memorandum under “Shareholders and Certain Transactions” and any amendment
subsequent to the Issue Date (so long as such amendment is not disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes
in any material respect) to any such agreement (except as covered by clause (e) hereof);

(g) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services (including, without
limitation, pursuant to joint venture arrangements), in each case in the ordinary course of business, which are
fair to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of
Directors or an Officer of the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable
than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(h) any transactions for which the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a letter from an
independent financial advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary from a financial standpoint or (ii) on terms not less favorable than might have been obtained in a
comparable transaction at such time on an arm’s length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate of the
Company; and

153


-----

(i) any participation in a public tender or exchange offers for securities or debt instruments issued by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that are conducted on arms’ length terms and provide for the same price
or exchange ratio, as the case may be, to all holders accepting such tender or exchange offer.

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) the Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by way of relief
from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of the
Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (such Fair Market Value to be determined on the date of contractually
agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets or Capital Stock issued or sold or otherwise disposed of;

(2) at least 75% of the consideration (excluding by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for,
any liabilities contingent or otherwise) received in the Asset Sale (except to the extent the Asset Sale is a Permitted
Asset Swap) by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents.

For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash:

(a) any liabilities, as shown on the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet, of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms
subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets
pursuant to a customary novation agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from
further liability;

(b) any securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from
such transferee that are converted by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days of the receipt thereof, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received in
that conversion; and

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset
Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, as determined in good faith by an officer of the Board of
Directors of the Company, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received
pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed €50 million (with the fair market value
of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving
effect to subsequent changes in value).

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Company may apply those Net Cash
Proceeds, if any, at its option:

(1) (i) to repay, repurchase, prepay or redeem (a) (I) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (other
than Indebtedness owed to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), (II) Indebtedness which is secured by a Lien
on such asset or (III) Indebtedness of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is secured by assets which do not
constitute Collateral or (b) Indebtedness of the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary incurred under Credit
Facilities pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant entitled “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral; provided, however,_
that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (i)(a), the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and will cause the related commitment (if any)
to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to prepay,
repay or purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Company shall redeem, repay or repurchase Pari Passu
Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Company either (A) reduces the aggregate principal amount of
Notes on an equal or ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Indebtedness repaid pursuant to this clause (ii) by
redeeming Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” and/or (B) makes (at such time or subsequently in
compliance with this covenant) an offer to the holders of the Notes to purchase their Notes in accordance with the
provisions set forth below of an Asset Sale Offer on an equal and ratable basis with any such Pari Passu Indebtedness
repaid pursuant to this clause (ii) (which offer shall be deemed to be an Asset Sale Offer for purposes hereof); or (iii)
to redeem Notes as provided under “—Optional Redemption” so long as such redemption is on a ratable or greater
than ratable basis with any Pari Passu Indebtedness concurrently repaid;

154


-----

(2) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, another Permitted Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(3) to make a capital expenditure;

(4) to acquire other long-term assets (other than Indebtedness or Capital Stock) that are used or useful in a Permitted
Business;

(5) to enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to clause (2), (3) or (4) of this paragraph;
_provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Cash Proceeds from the_
date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated
and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing.

Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or
otherwise invest the Net Cash Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this covenant, the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be required to apply any Net Cash Proceeds
in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds from all Asset Sales which is not
applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds €20 million.

Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will constitute
“Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €20 million, the Company will make an Asset
Sale Offer to all holders of Notes, and the Company will make any required offer to purchase Pari Passu Indebtedness
containing similar asset sale provisions, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness
that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to 100% of principal
amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain
after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such
Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee will select the Notes and such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis. For the purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of any such
Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such aggregate principal
amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Company that is within the Asset Sale Offer period.
Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. To the extent any portion of
Net Cash Proceeds payable in respect of the Notes are denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant
Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the
currency in which the Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Company upon converting such portion into such
currency.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and
regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes and
the related Note Guarantees pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities
laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their respective obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of
the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

**_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

The Board of Directors of the Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may designate any
Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If a Restricted Subsidiary
is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments owned by the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the
time of such designation and will either reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of the
covenant entitled “—Restricted Payments” or reduce the amount available for future Investments under one or more clauses of
the definition of Permitted Investments, as the Company shall determine. That designation will only be permitted if such
Investment would be permitted at that time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary. The Board of Directors of the Company or, if required by applicable law, the shareholders of the Company may
redesignate any Unrestricted Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary if the redesignation would not cause a Default.

155


-----

**_Additional Note Guarantees_**

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF Market,
the Company will publish a notice of such additional guarantees in accordance with the requirements of such rules.

The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to guarantee the payment of any other
Credit Facilities or other Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor unless such incurrence is permitted by the covenant
entitled “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”, and such Restricted Subsidiary
(if not already a Guarantor) simultaneously executes and delivers a supplemental indenture and an accession deed to the
intercreditor agreement pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee payment of the Notes on the same terms
and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
which Note Guarantee will be senior to or pari passu with such Restricted Subsidiary’s guarantee of such other Credit Facilities
or other Public Debt; provided that no such additional Note Guarantee need be provided in respect of Credit Facilities or other
Public Debt of the Company or any Guarantor (i) that does not exceed €50 million, in the aggregate with all other Credit
Facilities or other Public Debt described under this clause (i), (ii) if the guarantee of such Indebtedness is pursuant to a
regulatory requirement and such Credit Facilities or other Public Debt is owed to a regulatory body, or (iii) if such Credit
Facilities or other Public Debt is guaranteed by such Restricted Subsidiary on the Issue Date and such Restricted Subsidiary is
not a Guarantor.

The Company shall not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary to guarantee the Notes to the extent that (A) such Note
Guarantee is contrary to the Agreed Security Principles or could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in: (1) any
violation of applicable law that cannot be avoided or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary;
(3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including any Taxes) other than reasonable out of pocket expenses and other than
reasonable governmental or regulatory filing fees; and (4) a requirement under applicable law, rule or regulation to obtain or
prepare financial statements or financial information of such Person to be included in any required filing with a legal or
regulatory authority that the Company is not able to obtain or prepare through measures reasonably available to the Company,
(B) such Restricted Subsidiary is incorporated in any jurisdiction located in Argentina, China, Costa Rica, France, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Morocco, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand or Vietnam or (C) an inconsistency with
the Intercreditor Agreement or the Agreed Security Principles.

Each additional Note Guarantee will be limited as necessary to recognize certain defences generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purposes,
thin capitalization, distributable reserves, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of
creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraphs of this covenant, any Note Guarantee by a Restricted Subsidiary will provide by its
terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged when (i) the Indebtedness that gave rise to the
obligation to guarantee the Notes is discharged, (ii) in the case of any Note Guarantee granted as contemplated under the third
paragraph of this covenant as a result of a Restricted Subsidiary guaranteeing other Credit Facilities or Public Debt, when such
other Indebtedness is released and discharged, or (iii) otherwise under the circumstances described above under the caption “—
_Brief Description of the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the Intercreditor Agreement—The Note Guarantees.” The terms,_
provisions and limitations related to the Note Guarantees will be included in the Indenture.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Company shall not and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that would have the
result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that the incurrence of
Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the security interest with respect to the
Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes, and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the
Notes and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except
that the Company and is Restricted Subsidiaries may incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged,
transferred or released in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement;
_provided, however, that (a) nothing in this provision shall restrict the release or replacement of any security interests in_
compliance with the terms of the Indenture as described under “—Security—Release of Security Interests,” (b) any Security
Document may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, if
contemporaneously with any such action, the Company delivers to the Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an independent financial advisor confirming the solvency of the

156


-----

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant
Person which confirms the solvency of the Person granting such security interest after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or release and replacement, or (3) an Opinion
of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created
under the security so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens, in each case,
not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were
not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or
replacement, (c) the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or
otherwise modify or replace any Security Documents for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization and (d) the
applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect, error or
inconsistency therein. In the event that the Company complies with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and/or the
Security Agent (as the case may be) shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to any such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement without the need for instructions from
the holders of the Notes.

**_Suspension of Certain Covenants when Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, (1) two of the following three are satisfied: (i) the Notes are rated Baa3 or better by
Moody’s, (ii) the Notes are rated BBB− or better by S&P or (iii) the Notes are rated BBB− or better by Fitch (or, if either
Moody’s, S&P or Fitch ceases to rate the Notes for reasons outside of the control of the Company, the equivalent investment
grade credit rating from any other “nationally recognized statistical rating organization” within the meaning of Rule 15c31(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act selected by the Company as a replacement agency so that the Notes are so rated by at
least two such credit rating agencies); and (2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, then,
beginning on that day and subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, the covenants specifically listed under the

following captions in this offering memorandum will be suspended and, in each case, any related default provision of the
Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries:

(1) “—Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”;

(3) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) clause (4) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets”;_

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries”; and

(7) “—Additional Note Guarantees”.

During any period within which the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Company’s Board of Directors may not
designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described below under the caption “—
_Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” or the second paragraph of the definition of “Unrestricted_
_Subsidiary”._

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency should subsequently decline to below Baa3 or
BBB− (or the equivalent investment grades credit rating from any other “nationally recognized statistical rating organization”
within the meaning of Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act), as applicable, the foregoing covenants will be
reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with respect to
actions properly taken during the period of such suspension. Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant
will be made as if the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date except that no
default will be deemed to have occurred by reason of a Restricted Payment made while that covenant was suspended. On the
rating decline date, all Indebtedness incurred during the suspension period will be classified, at the Company’s option, as having

157


-----

been incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under the caption “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock” or one or more of the clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such_
covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to be incurred thereunder as of the rating decline date and after
giving effect to Indebtedness incurred prior to the suspension period and outstanding on the rating decline date). To the extent
that such Indebtedness would be so permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “—
_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”, such Indebtedness will be deemed to have_
been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified under clause (2) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred Stock and Disqualified Stock”.

The Company shall notify the Trustee that the conditions under this covenant have been satisfied, although such notification
shall not be a condition for the suspension of the covenants set forth above to be effective. The Trustee shall not be obliged to
notify holders of the Notes of such event.

**Reports**

The Company will post on its website and furnish to the Trustee and holders the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Company’s fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024,

quarterly report relates, in each case unless pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to

days prior to the last day of the completed fiscal quarter as to which such quarterly report relates shall be reported in
the next interim report provided pursuant to this covenant); (c) an operating and financial review of the unaudited

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared on a consistent basis for the periods presented

_provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable_
International Financial Reporting Standards, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods, subject to the
provisions of the Indenture. No report need include separate financial statements or financial data for any Guarantors or nonguarantor Subsidiaries of the Company; provided that the annual report in clause (1) shall include a statement of the aggregate
percentage of the Consolidated EBITDA of the Company represented by the Guarantors.

At any time that any of the Company’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the
financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in the operating and financial review of the financial condition and results
of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of
the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Company.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Company is not subject to Section
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Company will furnish to the holders,
upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Company may comply with the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above by providing any report or financial
statements of a direct or indirect Parent Company so long as such reports (if an annual, half yearly or quarterly report) (a) meet
the requirements of this covenant as if references to the Company therein were references to such Parent Company and (b) are
accompanied by condensed consolidated financial information together with separate columns for: (i) such Parent Company;
(ii) the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a combined basis; (iii) any other Subsidiaries of any applicable Parent
Company that are not the Company or Subsidiaries of the Company on a combined basis; (iv) consolidating adjustments; and
(v) the total consolidated amounts, none of which shall be required to be audited. Upon complying with the foregoing
requirement, the Company will be deemed to have complied with the requirements of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above. For the
avoidance of doubt, only Indebtedness of the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall be taken into account when making
any calculations required under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the above, following the initial Public Offering of ordinary shares of the Company or any Parent Company,
and for so long as such ordinary shares are listed on a recognized European or United States stock exchange, the requirements
of clauses (1), (2) and (3) above shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the relevant entity listing its Capital Stock complies
with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

At the request of the Company, in connection with the incurrence by the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any
Indebtedness permitted to be secured under the Indenture, the Company, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders (provided that the Trustee and the Security Agent shall have
received an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to that effect)); _provided that such Additional Intercreditor_
Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or
the Security Agent, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as the case
may be, under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

At the direction of the Company and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time
enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency
of any such agreement; (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be incurred
by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in
right of payment to the Notes); (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement; (4) secure the Notes (including any Additional Notes); (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the
Collateral to secure any Additional Notes or other Indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Indenture; or (6) make any other
change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders in any material respect (provided that the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall have received an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to that effect). The Company may

159


-----

only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the extent such amendment does not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, or adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture, any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor
Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein).

**Financial Calculations**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection with any acquisition,
merger, or investment, in each case, the consummation of which is not conditioned upon the availability of, or on obtaining,
third-party financing, where there is a time difference between commitment and closing or payment or incurrence (including
in respect of incurrence or assumption of Indebtedness or Liens, any Asset Sale, a Change of Control Triggering Event, the
making of any Restricted Payments and Permitted Investments, any acquisition, mergers, consolidation, amalgamation or other
business combination and any transaction requiring the testing any basket based on Total Assets or Consolidated EBITDA),
the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or Event of Default shall, at the option of the Company, be
the date the binding or definitive agreements for such acquisition, merger, or investment are entered into (or, in case of an
acquisition or other investment in the form of a tender or exchange offer in connection with which no definitive agreement is
entered into with the target company, the date of delivery of a binding offer, a “certain funds” tender offer, an irrevocable notice
or a similar event) and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to such acquisition,
merger, investment, to be entered into in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of
proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability
to consummate any such transaction (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio). For the
avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in such basket or ratio (including
due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of the Company or the target company) subsequent to such date
of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or arrangement, such baskets or ratios will not
be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the relevant
transaction or arrangement and the related transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested
at the time of consummation of such transaction or arrangement or related transactions; provided that if the Company elects to
have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement (or the date of delivery of a binding offer, a
“certain funds” tender offer, an irrevocable notice or a similar event, as the case may be), any such transactions (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive
agreements are entered and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after
the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such transaction or arrangement; _provided, further, that the_
Consolidated Net Income (and any other financial term derived therefrom), other than for purposes of calculating any ratios in
connection with such merger, acquisition or other Investment, shall not include any Consolidated Net Income of or attributable
to the target company or assets associated with any such merger, acquisition or Investment unless and until the consummation
of such merger, acquisition or Investment shall have actually occurred.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on, or Additional Amounts with respect to, the Notes;

(2) default in payment when due at maturity, upon redemption, upon repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise, of the
principal of, or premium, if any, on the Notes;

(3) failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to comply with the provisions described under the first paragraph of
caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(4) failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for 30 days after written notice to comply with the provisions
described under the captions “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” and “—Certain Covenants” (in each case,
other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under clause (2) above and a failure
to comply with the provisions described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets” described in clause (3) above);_

160


-----

(5) failure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for 60 days after written notice to comply with any of the other
agreements in the Indenture;

(6) default under any mortgage, Indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be
secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or
the payment of which is guaranteed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether such Indebtedness
or guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided
in such Indebtedness on the date of such default (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity;

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such
Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated,
aggregates €60 million or more;

(7) failure by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments (which are not covered by insurance
as to which a claim has been submitted and the insurer has not disclaimed or indicated an intent to disclaim
responsibility for the payment thereof) aggregating in excess of €60 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged
or stayed for a period of 60 days;

(8) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee of any Significant Subsidiary of the Notes shall be held in
any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect and
any such Default continues for 10 days or any Guarantor shall deny or disaffirm in writing its obligations under its
Note Guarantee;

(9) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the relevant Security Documents, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement) for any reason other than satisfaction in full of all obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the Security
Documents, the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or the Indenture
or any security interest created pursuant to the Indenture and theSecurity Documents shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable or the Company shall assent in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable or any
pledgor disaffirms in writing its obligations under the Security Documents and any such Default continues for 10
days;

(10) [Reserved]; and

(11) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary.

However, a default under clauses (4), (5) or (6) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the
holders of 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company of the default and, with respect to
clauses (4), (5) or (6), the Company does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (4), (5) or (6), as applicable,
of this paragraph after receipt of such notice.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to the Company, any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or
notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration
of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (6) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” has
occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default
or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders
of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30
days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except

161


-----

nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely
because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

Holders may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The
Trustee may withhold from holders notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice
is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest, or Additional Amounts.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf
of the holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture
except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or Additional Amounts on, or the principal of, the
Notes.

Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default that would give either the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% or
more in aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding the right to declare the Notes immediately due and payable, the
Company is required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

If a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at
the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be cured without any further action. Any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the
time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or
certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery within the 30 day
period contemplated by clause (4) of the first paragraph under this caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” of any such
report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed
period specified in the Indenture.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such, will have any liability
for any obligations of the Company or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture or the Note Guarantees or for any claim
based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting a Note waives and releases
all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective
to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws of the United States.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding
Notes and all obligations of any of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees (“Legal Defeasance”)
except for:

(1) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, or interest or premium,
and Additional Amounts, if any, on such Notes when such payments are due from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Company’s obligations with respect to the Notes concerning issuing temporary Notes, registration of Notes,
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for
security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company’s and any Guarantor’s obligations
in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

In addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Company and any Guarantors
released with respect to certain covenants that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any
omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to the Notes. In the
event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events (excluding non-payment, bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation and
insolvency events) described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes.

162


-----

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(1) the Company must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee or an Agent nominated by the Trustee
for such purpose, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, cash in euros, non-callable European Government
Obligations, or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government Obligations, in amounts as
will be sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the
principal of, or interest and premium, and Additional Amounts, if any, on the outstanding Notes on the stated maturity
or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the Notes are being
defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;

(2) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of
counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming
that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service a
ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in
either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel will confirm that, the beneficial owners of
the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion
of counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming
that the beneficial owners of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax
on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant
Defeasance had not occurred;

(4) no Event of Default described in clause (11) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” has occurred and is continuing
on the date of such deposit;

(5) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under
any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;

(6) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made or caused to be
made by the Company with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of the Company
or otherwise defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company; and

(7) the Company must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel
may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent relating to the
Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as provided in the next two succeeding paragraphs, the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents may be amended or supplemented with the
consent of the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes), and any existing default or
compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents may be waived with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes). For so long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange and traded on the Euro MTF Market and the rules of this exchange so require, the Company will inform the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and publish a notice of any such amendment, supplement or waiver at www.bourse.lu.

Without the consent of holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of then outstanding Notes affected (including,
without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Notes), an
amendment or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

163


-----

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption
of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the covenant described above under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries”);_

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, or interest, premium, or Additional Amounts, if
any, on the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of holders of
Notes to receive payments of principal of, or interest, premium, or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes;

(7) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment required by the covenant described above
under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted
_Subsidiaries”);_

(8) release any Guarantor from any of its obligations under its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral other than in accordance
with the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
as otherwise permitted by the Indenture; or

(10) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions.

Notwithstanding the preceding, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Company, the Trustee and the other parties
thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Notes or the Note Guarantees, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of Definitive Registered Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Company’s or a Guarantor’s obligations to holders in the case of a merger or
consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s or such Guarantor’s assets;

(4) to make such changes as are necessary to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in compliance with the
covenants described herein (including for the issuance of Additional Notes denominated in a currency different from
the currency of the initially issued Notes), or to add guarantees in favor of the Notes;

(5) to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant security interest in favor of the Security Agent to the extent necessary to
grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person; _provided that the granting of such security interest is not_
prohibited by the Indenture and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Impairment of Security
_Interest” is complied with;_

(6) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents or the Notes to any provision of
this “Description of the Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Notes” was intended to be
a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Note Guarantees or the Notes;

(7) to add additional assets or property as Collateral;

(8) to evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee or Security Agent under the
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

164


-----

(9) as provided under “—Additional Intercreditor Agreements”;

(10) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Guarantee with respect to the Notes;

(11) to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any guarantee or Lien (including the
Collateral and the Security Documents) with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination, discharge
or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) to facilitate any transaction that complies with (a) the definition of “Permitted Reorganization” or (b) the covenants
described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Equity Interests in Restricted Subsidiaries” relating to mergers, consolidations and_
sales of assets; or

(13) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders or that does not adversely affect
the legal rights under the Indenture of any such holder in any material respect.

The consent of the holders of Notes is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed
amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment
or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of Notes given in connection with a tender of such holder’s Notes will not be
rendered invalid by such tender.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to rely absolutely on such evidence as it deems
appropriate, including an Opinion of Counsel and an Officer’s Certificate.

For purposes of determining whether holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Notes of a series have taken any
action under the Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of any series of Notes will be deemed to be the Euro Equivalent of
the aggregate principal amount of such Notes as of (i) such date (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such
action) or (ii) the date the taking of such action by holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Notes has been
certified to the Trustee by the Company (if no such record date has been set).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the paragraph above, in order to effect an amendment authorized by clause (10)
above, it shall only be necessary for the supplemental indenture to be duly authorized and executed by the Company, such
additional Guarantor and the Trustee.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Notes issued thereunder, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes that have been replaced or paid
and Notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Company, have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason
of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise or will become due and payable within one year and
the Company or any Guarantor has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust
funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders, cash in euros, non-callable European Government
Obligations, or a combination of cash in euros and non-callable European Government Obligations, in an
aggregate amount as will be sufficient without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and
discharge the entire indebtedness on the Notes not delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal,
premium, Additional Amounts, if any, and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit or will occur as a result of
such deposit and such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, any other
instrument to which the Company or any Guarantor is a party or by which the Company or any Guarantor is bound;

(3) the Company or any Guarantor has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it under the Indenture; and

165


-----

(4) the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money
toward the payment of the Notes at maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Company must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel to the Trustee stating that all
conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Company or any Guarantor, the Indenture will limit its right to obtain payment of
claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest, it must eliminate such
conflict within 90 days or resign. If the Trustee becomes the owner or pledgee of the Notes it may deal with the Company with
the same rights it would have if it were not the Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar or such other agent.

The holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The
Indenture provides that in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its
power, to use the degree of care of a prudent man in the conduct of his own affairs. The Trustee undertakes to perform such
duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in the Indenture, and no implied covenants or obligations can be read
into the Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory
to it against any loss, liability or expense.

**Judgment Currency**

Any payment on account of an amount that is payable in euros, (each a “Required Currency”) which is made to or for the
account of any holder of a Note in lawful currency of any other jurisdiction (the “Other Currency”) whether as a result of any
judgment or order or the enforcement thereof or the realization of any security or the liquidation of any of the Company or any
Guarantor shall constitute a discharge of the Company’s or such Guarantor’s obligation under the Indenture, the Notes or, the
Note Guarantees, as the case may be, only to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency which such holder could
purchase in the New York foreign exchange markets with the amount of the Other Currency in accordance with normal banking
procedures at the rate of exchange prevailing on the first day (other than a Saturday or Sunday) on which banks in New York,
are generally open for business following receipt of the payment first referred to above. If the amount of the Required Currency
that could be so purchased is less than the amount of the Required Currency originally due to such holder, the Company or
such Guarantor, as the case may be, shall indemnify and save harmless such holder from and against all loss or damage arising
out of or as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall constitute an obligation separate and independent from the other

calculated as if the rate in effect on the date of determination had been the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into
account any Hedging Obligation applicable to such Indebtedness). For purposes of this definition, whenever pro forma effect
is to be given to any Indebtedness incurred pursuant to a revolving credit facility, the amount outstanding on the date of such

such shorter period for which the facility was outstanding or (2) if such facility was created after the end of such four fiscal
quarters, the average daily balance of such Indebtedness during the period from the date of creation of such facility to the date

Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Global Notes”) will in each case be represented by one or more global Notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached and the Notes issued to non-U.S. persons outside the Unites States in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act (the “Regulation S Global Notes”) will initially in each case be represented by one or more global
Notes in registered form without interest coupons attached. The Rule 144A Global Notes together with the Regulation S Global
Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global Notes”. The Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with, or on behalf
of, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and together with the Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream
or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear or Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on
behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective

form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. The laws of some jurisdictions, including some
states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair your ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition,
while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or “holders” of Notes for
any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary (or its nominees), as applicable, will be
considered the sole holder(s) of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. In addition, participants must rely on
the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests or to
exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor any of their respective agents and none of the Registrar, the Paying Agent or
the Transfer Agent will have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective
nominee), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received
by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The common depositary will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar
for a cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the common depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to
mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note
as a result of such partial redemption. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry
Interests will be equal to the amount received by Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption
of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). The Issuer understands that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream,
if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €100,000 in principal amount may be redeemed in
part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium,
if any, interest and Additional Amounts, if any) to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their customary procedures. The Issuer will make payments of
all such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or

190


-----

governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding is required
to be made by any applicable law or regulation or otherwise as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional
_Amounts”, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts”, the Issuer will pay Additional_
Amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry
Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise
received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The
Issuer expects that standing customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of
Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and
the Registrar will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (e.g., the common depositary (or its nominees)) as the owner
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither the Issuer, the Guarantors, the
Trustee the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar nor any of their respective agents has or will have any
responsibility or liability for:

(1) any aspect of the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or of any participant or indirect participant relating to
or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to or payments made
on account of a Book-Entry Interest;

(2) Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

(3) the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such
participants.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or Clearstream and any holder, the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such
Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euros.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the
applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee nor the Initial Purchasers nor any of their
respective agents and none of the Registrar, the Paying Agent or the Transfer Agent will be liable to any holder of a Global
Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion
or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are
credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or
participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of
consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under
the Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered Notes in
certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures may change from time to time.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the
Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.”

191


-----

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests
will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S
Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S, Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under
the U.S. Securities Act.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global
Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global
Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer
restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains
such a Book-Entry Interest.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer
such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar or the Transfer Agent. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of
a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be
issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the
holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive
Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 will be issued.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of
interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation
to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None
of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar or any of their respective agents will have any
responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes if:

    - Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the
Global Notes, and the Issuer fails to appoint a successor;

    - Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture; or

    - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to
request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests for
a Definitive Registered Note and not only to the owner who made the initial request. In such an event, the Issuer will issue
Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on
behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based
upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the
Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrar and the Transfer Agents shall
be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for
treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time
on the register maintained by the Registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes. In the case of the
issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it
to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented
by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred,

192


-----

and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the
transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and
in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging
and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect
of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been
lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or
at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement
Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder
requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond or security sufficient in the judgment of
both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the
Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer, the Registrar
and/or the Trustee may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due
and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note,
as the case may be.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests
may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in
accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to
such Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

**Trustee’s Powers**

In considering the interests of the holders of the Notes, while title to the Notes is registered in the name of a nominee
for a clearing system, the Trustee may have regard to any information provided to it by that clearing system as to the identity
(either individually or by category) of its account holders with entitlements to Notes and may consider such interests as if such
account holders were the holders of the Notes.

**Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System**

**_Initial Settlement_**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euros. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream
accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Euro bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests
will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the Business Day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.
Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests
where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**_Special Timing Considerations_**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open for business.

In addition, due to time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving
Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same Business Day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their

193


-----

interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions
will not be performed until the next Business Day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**_Clearing Information_**

The Issuer expects that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream.
The international securities identification numbers and common codes numbers for the Notes are set out under “Listing and
_General Information.”_

**_Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream_**

The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a
matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and
are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor the
Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the
systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

    - Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their
participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets
in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters,
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to
Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that
clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly
or indirectly.

    - Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account
holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest
to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions
in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer
understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by
owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that
a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants
owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize
indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect
participants.

The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial
interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes
only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**TAXATION**

_If you are a prospective investor, you should consult your tax advisor on the possible tax consequences of buying,_
_holding or selling any Notes under the laws of your country of citizenship, residence or domicile, including the effect of any_
_local taxes applicable to you. The discussions that follow do not purport to be a comprehensive description of all tax_
_considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or sell Notes. In particular, these discussions do not_
_consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to you. The discussions that follow for each jurisdiction are based_
_upon the applicable laws and interpretations thereof as in effect as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. These tax laws_
_and interpretations are subject to change, possibly with retroactive or retrospective effect._

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
disposition of Notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder
(as defined below) and that are acquired upon original issuance at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial
amount of Notes is sold to investors for cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations
acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers).

For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for United States federal
income tax purposes, any of the following:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of
Columbia;

    - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or

    - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United
States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect
under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and
applicable United States Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be
changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those
summarized below. We have not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service (the
“IRS”) with respect to any of the United States federal income tax consequences described below, and as a result there can be
no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions we have reached and describe herein.

This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes, does not address any United States
federal taxes other than United States federal income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes or the Medicare tax on certain investment
income) and does not deal with any non-U.S., state, local or other tax consequences that may be relevant to U.S. holders in
light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal
income tax consequences applicable to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax
laws. For example, this summary does not address:

    - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,
persons required to accelerate the recognition of any items of gross income with respect to the Notes as a result
of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement, financial institutions, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States
federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

    - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion
transaction or a straddle;

    - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or

195


-----

    - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any.

If an entity treated as a partnership (or other pass-through entity) for United States federal income tax purposes holds
our Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership (or other owner in such a pass-through entity) will generally
depend upon the status of the partner (or other owner) and the activities of the entity. If you are a partner of a partnership (or
other owner of a pass-through entity) considering an investment in our Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.

**If you are considering the purchase of Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the**
**particular United States federal tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, as**
**well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**

**_Notes subject to contingencies_**

In certain circumstances (see “Description of Notes—Change of Control”), we may be obligated to pay you additional
amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the Notes or in advance of their scheduled payment date. It is possible that
our obligation to make such payments on the Notes could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to
“contingent payment debt instruments”. If the Notes were characterized as contingent payment debt instruments, you might,
among others, be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes and to treat any
gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain.

We intend to take the position that the likelihood of any such payments on the Notes is remote, and thus, that the Notes
should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination that these contingencies are remote is binding
on you unless you disclose your contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination,
however, is not binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, you might be required to include in
gross income an amount of interest in excess of stated interest and prior to the receipt of cash, and you might be required to
treat income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. In the event a
contingency occurs, it would affect the amount and timing of income recognized by you. If any contingent amounts are in fact
paid, you will be required to recognize such amounts as income.

The remainder of this summary assumes that our determination that the contingencies are remote is correct. The
Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation,
however, and the scope of the regulations is not certain. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the possible
application of the contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.

**_Payments of stated interest_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, stated interest on a Note (including any amount withheld as
withholding tax, and any additional amounts paid in respect thereof) generally will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the
time it is paid or accrued in accordance with your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.

You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the
election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest on a
Note (including any additional amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United
States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, general
category income. You generally will be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where
you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules
governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding availability of the foreign
tax credit under your particular circumstances.

If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to
include in income (as ordinary income) the United States dollar value of the euro interest payment, determined by translating
the euro received at the spot rate (as defined in United States Treasury regulations) in effect on the date such payment is
received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into United States dollars. You will not recognize foreign
currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but you may have exchange gain or loss attributable
to the actual disposition of the euro so received.

If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the
amount of income recognized with respect to the euro interest payment in accordance with either of two methods. Under the

196


-----

first method, which will apply unless you elect to use the second method described below, you will be required to include in
income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the United States dollar value of the euro-denominated interest that has
accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest into United States dollars at the average spot rate of exchange
for the period or periods (or portions thereof) in such taxable year during which such interest accrued. Under the second method,
you may elect to translate interest income into United States dollars at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the interest accrual
period, or the last day of the taxable year for any portion of any accrual period ending on the last day of such taxable year; or
(ii) the date the interest payment is received, if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This
election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS.
You should consult your own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election.

Upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including amounts received upon the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), a U.S. holder using the accrual
method will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the United
States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt)
and the United States dollar value of the interest previously included in income with respect to such payment, regardless of
whether the payment is in fact converted into United States dollars at such time. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or
loss generally will be treated, for United States foreign tax credit purposes, as United States source ordinary income or loss,
and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of notes_**

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized
upon such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition (less any amounts attributable to accrued but
unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest income as described above in _“—Payments of interest” to the extent not_
previously included in income) and your adjusted tax basis in the Note.

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be your United States dollar cost for the Note. If you purchased your
Note with euros, your United States dollar cost generally will be the United States dollar value of the euros paid for such Note
determined at the spot rate at the time of purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of
in a taxable transaction for euros, then your amount realized generally will be the United States dollar value of the euros
received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such disposition. However, if you are a cash method taxpayer and the
Notes are traded on an established securities market, the amount realized generally will be the United States dollar value of
such euros received based on the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. An accrual method taxpayer may
elect the same treatment with respect to the sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election
is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder. Such election cannot be changed without the consent
of the IRS. An accrual method taxpayer that does not make the foregoing election will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) if there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the
settlement date.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized generally will be capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year.
Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The
deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss realized by you on the disposition of a Note would
generally be treated as United States source gain or loss.

A portion of any gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss.
Any exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as United States
source gain or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your
purchase price for the Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is
equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on
the date of the disposition of the Note (or, possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement
date of disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax
purposes) and (ii) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased
the Note (or, possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of purchase, if the Note
is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange
gain or loss (including with respect to any accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the
disposition of the Note.

197


-----

**_Exchange gain or loss with respect to foreign currency_**

On a sale or other taxable disposition of euros, you generally will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between (i) the amount of United States dollars, or the fair market value in United States dollars of any other
property, received by you in such disposition and (ii) your adjusted tax basis in the euros. Your adjusted tax basis in any euros
received as interest on, or on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of, a Note will be the
United States dollar value thereof at the spot rate in effect on the date the euros are received.

Any gain or loss recognized by you on a sale or other taxable disposition of euros generally will be ordinary income
or loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes.

**_Reportable transactions_**

Applicable United States Treasury regulations meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter transactions could
be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency transactions. Under
the applicable United States Treasury regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in
certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a foreign currency note or foreign
currency received in respect of a foreign currency note to the extent that such sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other
taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you are considering the purchase of a Note, you are
urged to consult your own tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the
Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement) as part of your United
States federal income tax return, and the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**_Backup withholding and information reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments of interest on, and the proceeds from a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other disposition of, a Note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient (such as a
corporation). Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number or to certify that you are not subject to
backup withholding, you may be subject to backup withholding with respect to the foregoing amounts.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules generally will
be allowed as a refund or a credit against your United States federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required
information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Foreign financial asset reporting_**

Certain U.S. holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions
(including an exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by United States financial institutions), by attaching a complete
IRS Form 8938 (Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets) to their tax return for each year in which they hold an interest
in the Notes. You are urged to consult your own tax advisors regarding information reporting requirements relating to your
ownership of the Notes, including the significant penalties for non-compliance.

**Taxation in Spain**

The following is a general description of certain Spanish tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport
to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes, whether in Spain or elsewhere, or to deal with the tax
consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which might be subject to special rules. Holders or prospective
holders of Notes should consult their own tax advisers as to the consequences under the tax laws of the country of which they
are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of Spain of acquiring, holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments
of interest, principal or other amounts under the Notes. The discussions below are included for general information purposes
only.

This summary is based on law and regulations applicable generally in Spain which are in effect as of the date of this
Offering Memorandum and is subject to any changes that can be enacted after that date. Special rules may apply in specific
areas or regions within Spain. Prospective investors should seek specific advice in this regard.

**_Indirect taxation_**

Whatever the nature and residence of the holders of the Notes, the acquisition and transfer of the Notes will be exempt
from indirect taxes in Spain, _i.e., Transfer Tax and Stamp Duty, in accordance with the consolidated text of such tax_
promulgated by Royal Legislative Decree 1/1993, of September 24, 1993, and exempt from Value Added Tax, in accordance
with Law 37/1992, of December 28, 1992 regulating such tax.

**_Tax rules for Notes listed on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized market_**
**_on any interest payment date_**

**_Spanish resident individuals_**

_Personal Income Tax_

In the case of Spanish resident individuals, both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer
or redemption of the Notes constitute a return on investment obtained from the lending of capital in accordance with the
provisions of Section 25 of the PIT Law, and therefore will form part of the savings income tax base and will be taxed at the
applicable rates, currently ranging from 19.0% to 28.0%.

In the case of Spanish resident individuals, no withholding on account of PIT will be imposed on payments of interest
by the Company or the Paying Agent or on income derived from the redemption, transfer or repayment of the Notes by the
Company or the Paying Agent, provided that certain requirements are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the
Company, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed Payment Statement). See “—Compliance with certain
_requirements in connection with income payments”._

Notwithstanding the above, in the case that the Notes held by Spanish resident individuals are deposited with a Spanish
resident entity or individual or with a permanent establishment in Spain of a nonresident entity acting as depositary or collecting
agent, interest collected under the Notes and income obtained upon the redemption and transfer of the Notes may be subject to
withholding tax at the applicable rate, currently 19%. In any event, the individual holder may credit the withholding against his
or her final PIT liability for the relevant tax year.

_Net Wealth Tax and Solidarity Tax_

According to Wealth Tax regulations (subject to any exceptions provided under relevant legislation in an Autonomous
Region (Comunidad Autónoma), Spanish resident individuals whose net worth is above €700,000 on the last day of any year
will be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax on their total net wealth (including the Notes) for such year at rates currently ranging
from 0.2% to 3.5%. The Notes shall be valued using their average market value during the last quarter of such year. The
Ministry of Finance publishes annually this average trading price for the Wealth Tax purposes.

The minimum exempt amount and the tax rates may vary among the different autonomous communities of Spain.
Therefore, Spanish tax resident individuals holding the Notes should consult with their tax advisors when it comes to their
specific situation.

In addition to Wealth Tax, there is a temporary “solidarity tax on major fortunes” that applies to the wealth of
individuals in excess of €3,000,000 (with a €700,000 general tax allowance), with rates from 1.7% to 3.5% (although the tax
was initially created only for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the application of the tax has been extended indefinitely, with effect
from fiscal year 2024, by virtue of Royal Decree-law 8/2023 of December 27).

The Solidarity Tax applies, in general terms and under certain contitions, to those tax payers resident in an autonomous
region where the Wealth Tax is partially or fully exempt. The amount of Weath Tax effectively paid will be deductible from
the Solidarity Tax.

Filing obligations would only be applicable to tax payers who have to pay Solidarity Tax. Holders of the Notes should
consult their own tax advisors regarding how this tax may apply to their investment in the Notes.

200


-----

_Inheritance and Gift Tax_

Spanish resident individuals who acquire ownership or other rights over any Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy will
be subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax at rates currently ranging from 7.65% to 34%. However, after applying all
relevant factors (such as the specific regulations imposed by each Spanish autonomous community, the amount of the preexisting assets of the taxpayer and the degree of kinship with the deceased or donor), the final effective tax rate may range from
0% (full exemption) to 87.6%.

_Disclosure obligation for assets held abroad_

Notes held by Spanish resident individuals deposited with or managed by nonresident entities shall be subject to the
general obligation to disclose information regarding assets located outside Spain.

**_Spanish resident entities_**

_Corporate Income Tax_

In the case of Spanish resident entities, both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer or
redemption of the Notes are subject to CIT at the current general flat tax rate—currently 25% or the special tax rate that may
apply to certain taxpayers (such as banks, which are subject to a tax rate of 30%).

In the case of Spanish resident entities, no withholding on account of CIT will be imposed on payments of interest by
the Company or the Paying Agent or on income derived from the redemption, transfer or repayment of the Notes by the
Company or the Paying Agent, provided that certain requirements are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the
Company, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed Payment Statement). See “—Compliance with certain
_requirements in connection with income payments”._

Notwithstanding the above, in the case that the Notes held by Spanish resident entities are deposited with a Spanish
resident entity or individual or with a permanent establishment in Spain of a nonresident entity acting as depositary or collecting
agent, interest collected under the Notes and income obtained upon the redemption and transfer of the Notes may be subject to
withholding tax at the applicable rate (currently 19%). However, there is no obligation to withhold on income obtained by
Spanish resident entities (which, for the sake of clarity, include Spanish tax resident investment funds and Spanish tax resident
pension funds) from financial instruments issued by Spanish resident entities—as is the case of the Notes—placed and traded
in organized markets in OECD countries as specified in Article 61 of the CIT regulations. We will make an application for the
Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be traded on the Euro MTF. However, there
are no assurances that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trade on the Euro MTF. See “—Tax rules for
_Notes not listed on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized market on any interest_
_payment date” in relation to the main tax implications derived from the Notes not being listed._

Amounts withheld, if any, may be credited by corporate investors against their final CIT liability.

_Disclosure obligation for assets held abroad_

Notes held by Spanish resident entities deposited before or managed by nonresident entities shall be subject to the
general obligation to disclose information regarding assets located outside Spain.

**_Nonresident holders_**

**_Nonresident Income Tax_**

_Nonresident holders acting through a permanent establishment in Spain_

If the Notes form part of the assets of a permanent establishment in Spain of a nonresident holder, the tax rules
applicable to income deriving from such Notes are, generally, the same as those set out above for Spanish resident entities. See
“—Spanish resident entities”. Ownership of the Notes by a nonresident holder will not in itself create a permanent establishment
in Spain.

201


-----

_Nonresident holders not acting through a permanent establishment in Spain_

Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer or redemption of the Notes obtained by
nonresident holders which do not act, with respect to the Notes, through a permanent establishment in Spain, are exempt from
NRIT and therefore no withholding on account of NRIT will be levied on such income provided certain requirements are met
(including that the Paying Agent provides the Company, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed Payment
Statement). See “—Compliance with certain requirements in connection with income payments”.

If the Paying Agent for any reason fails to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment Statement to the Company
in a timely manner in respect of a payment of income under the Notes, the Company will withhold Spanish withholding tax at
the then-applicable rate (currently 19%) on such payment. In this case nonresident holders are entitled to a refund of the amount
withheld, with no need for any action on their part, if the Paying Agent provides the Company with a duly executed and
completed Payment Statement no later than the 10[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant payment
date. In addition, following the 20[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant payment date, the nonresident
holder may apply to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which it may be entitled. The application may be filed within
four years following the last day on which the Company may pay any amount so withheld to the Spanish Treasury (which is
generally the 20[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant payment date), by filing with the Spanish tax
authorities (i) the relevant Spanish tax form, (ii) proof of ownership and (iii) a certificate of residence issued by the tax
authorities of the country of tax residence of the nonresident holder, among other documents. Nonresident holders are advised
to consult their own tax advisors regarding their eligibility to claim a refund from the Spanish tax authorities and the procedures
to be followed in such circumstances.

_Net Wealth Tax and Solidarity Tax_

Nonresident holders who are individuals (“nonresident individuals”) are subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax, which
imposes a tax on property and rights in excess of €700,000 that are located in Spain, or can be exercised within the Spanish
territory, on the last day of any year (such as the Notes).

Notwithstanding the above, nonresident individuals that do not obtain income from the Notes through a permanent
establishment in Spain will be exempt from Spanish Net Wealth Tax regarding the holding of the Notes. Furthermore, holders
of the Notes who benefit from a tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to wealth tax that provides for
taxation only in the country of residence of the holder of the Notes will not be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax.

If the provisions of the foregoing paragraph do not apply, nonresident individuals whose net worth related to property
located, or rights that can be exercised, in Spain is above €700,000 and who hold Notes on the last day of any year would be
subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax for such year at the applicable rates—currently ranging from 0.2% to 3.5%—on the average
market value of the Notes during the last quarter of such year. However, nonresident individuals may apply the rules approved
by the autonomous region where the largest value of assets and rights is located.

Nonresident holders which are legal entities (“nonresident entities”) are not subject to the Spanish Net Wealth Tax.

In addition to Wealth Tax, there is a temporary “solidarity tax on major fortunes” that may apply to nonresident
individuals whose properties and rights are located in Spain or that can be exercised within the Spanish territory and exceed
€3,000,000, (with a €700,000 tax allowance) with rates from 1.7% to 3.5% (although the tax was initially created only for fiscal
years 2022 and 2023, the application of the tax has been extended indefinitely, with effect from fiscal year 2024, by virtue of
Royal Decree-law 8/2023 of December 27).

The amount payable for this tax could be reduced by the amount paid for Wealth Tax. Noteholders should consult
their own tax advisors regarding how this tax may apply to their investment in the Notes.

_Inheritance and Gift Tax_

Nonresident individuals who acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy will be
subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax, at rates currently ranging from 7.65% to 34. However, after applying all
relevant factors (such as the specific regulations imposed by each Spanish autonomous community, the amount of the preexisting assets of the taxpayer and the degree of kinship with the deceased or donor), the final effective tax rate may range from
0% (full exemption) to 87.6%.

202


-----

However, if the nonresident individual is a tax resident of a country which has entered with Spain into a treaty for the
avoidance of double taxation in relation to Inheritance and Gift Tax the provisions of the relevant treaty will apply.

Generally, nonresident individuals are subject to Inheritance and Gift Tax according to the rules set forth in the state
legislation. However, if the deceased or the donee are not resident in Spain, they may opte to apply the applicable rules
corresponding to the relevant Autonomous Communities regulations.

Nonresident entities which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy are not
subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax, but such acquisitions will be subject to NRIT, without prejudice to the
provisions of any applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation on income entered into by Spain. In general, tax
treaties for the avoidance of double taxation on income provide for the taxation of this type of income exclusively in the country
of tax residence of the beneficiary.

**_Compliance with certain requirements in connection with income payments_**

As described under _“—Spanish resident individuals—Personal Income Tax”, “—Spanish resident entities—_
_Corporate Income Tax” and “—Nonresident holders—Nonresident Income Tax”, provided the conditions set forth in additional_
provision 1 of Law 10/2014 and in the Regulations approved by Royal Decree 1065/ 2007 are met, income paid in respect of
the Notes by the Company or the Paying Agent will not be subject to Spanish withholding tax. For these purposes, “income”
includes interest paid on the Notes or the amount of the difference, if any, between the aggregate redemption, repayment or
transfer price paid upon the redemption of the Notes (or a portion thereof) and the aggregate principal amount of such Notes.

Such conditions include the following:

a) The Notes must be admitted to listing on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other
organized market. We believe the Notes will comply with this requirement.

b) The Notes must originally be registered in a clearing system, which, in the case of resident individuals, must
be located outside Spain. We believe the Notes will comply with this requirement.

c) At the time of each relevant payment date the Paying Agent must submit to the Company a duly executed
and completed Payment Statement including the following information:

(i) identification of the Notes,

(ii) payment date,

(iii) total amount of income to be paid on the relevant payment date, and

(iv) total amount of income corresponding to Notes held through each clearing system.

Additional information would have to be included in the Payment Statement if the clearing system in which the Notes
are originally registered were located in Spain.

In the event that the currently applicable conditions set forth in additional provision 1 of Law 10/2014 and in the
Regulations approved by Royal Decree 1065/ 2007 are modified, amended or supplemented by, among others, any Spanish
law, regulation, interpretation or ruling of the Spanish tax authorities, the Company shall notify the holders of the Notes of
such information procedures and their implictions, as the Issuer may be required to apply withholding tax on the relevant
distributions if the information procedures are not complied with.

In light of the above, the Company and the Paying Agent will enter into a paying agency agreement which, among
others, will provide for the timely provision by the Paying Agent of a duly executed and completed Payment Statement in
connection with each income payment under the Notes.

**_Tax rules for Notes not listed on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized_**
**_market on any interest payment date_**

_Withholding on account of PIT, NRIT and CIT_

If the Notes are not listed on a regulated market, on a multi-lateral trading facility or on any other organized market
on any date on which income in respect of the Notes will be paid (i.e., either a date on which interest is payable on the Notes
or a date on which the Notes are transferred or redeemed), payments of income to holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes
will be subject to Spanish withholding tax at the then-applicable rate (currently, 19%) except in the case of holders of the Notes
which are (A) residents of a European Union or a European Economic Area member state other than Spain and that obtain such
income either directly or through a permanent establishment located in another European Union or European Economic Area
member state; provided that such holders of the Notes (i) do not obtain such income on the Notes through a permanent
establishment in Spain and (ii) are not resident of, are not located in, nor obtain income through, a non-cooperative jurisdiction
according to the Spanish legislation and the criteria set forth by the Spanish tax authorities from time to time; or (B) resident
for tax purposes in a country which has entered into a tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with Spain which provides
for a full exemption from Spanish tax or a reduced withholding tax rate with respect to income payable to any holder of the
Notes, subject to the provision of an annual certificate of tax residency.

Individuals and entities that may benefit from such exemptions or reduced tax rates should apply directly to the
Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which they may be entitled. In such case, additional amounts would be payable in
respect of such Spanish withholding tax, as described in “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts.”

**_Financial transaction tax_**

In February 2013, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive for a common financial transaction
tax (the “FTT”) in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the
“participating Member States”). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate.

The proposed FTT had a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including
secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.
Under the current proposals, the FTT could apply, in certain circumstances, to persons both within and outside of the
participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial
institution and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to
be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person
established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a
participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the scope of
any such tax is uncertain. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear.
Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and participating Member States may decide not to participate.
Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation with the FTT.

In Spain, the Spanish law which implements the Spanish tax on financial transactions (the “Spanish FTT”) was
approved on October 7, 2020 (the “FTT Law”) and the FTT Law was published on the Spanish Official State Gazette on
October 16, 2020.

Spanish FTT charges a 0.2% rate on specific acquisitions of listed shares issued by Spanish companies whose market
capitalization exceeds €1 billion, regardless of the jurisdiction of residence of the parties involved in the transaction. According
to the terms of the Spanish FTT Law, this indirect tax should not apply to the acquisition of the Notes or dealings in the Notes
thereafter.

**_Taxation on payments made by a Guarantor_**

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes, it is possible that such payments may be
subject to withholding tax in accordance with applicable tax laws in relevant jurisdictions.

204


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of the Notes by employee benefit
plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), plans,
individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the “Code”) or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that
are similar to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets” of such plans, accounts and arrangements pursuant to ERISA or otherwise (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its
fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or
control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan,
or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a
fiduciary of the ERISA Plan.

In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether
the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA,
the Code or any Similar Laws relating to the fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence,
diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar
Laws.

Each Plan should consider that none of the Transaction Parties will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to any
decision to invest in the Notes and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to such decision. “Transaction Party” means any of the Company, the Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates, other than an affiliate of an Initial Purchaser that is a named fiduciary (or a fiduciary appointed by a named
fiduciary) with respect to the management of the assets of the applicable Plan and acting in accordance with an applicable
prohibited transaction exemption (the applicable conditions of which are satisfied).

**Prohibited Transaction Laws**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions
involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest”, within the meaning of Section 3(14) of ERISA, or
“disqualified persons”, within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. A party in interest
or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties
and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code.

The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Company, a Subsidiary
Guarantor or an Initial Purchaser is a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect
prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S.
Department of Labor has issued Prohibited Transaction Class Exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and
holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by
independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE
91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE
96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions
and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings the Notes in reliance on
these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that
any class exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or
that if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by acceptance of a Note or any interest therein, each purchaser and holder will be deemed to have
represented and warranted that either (i) it is not acquiring or holding the Notes (or any interest therein) with the assets of a

205


-----

Plan or (ii) the acquisition and holding of the Notes (or any interest therein) will not result in a non-exempt prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.
In addition, if it is a Plan, it will be deemed to have represented and warranted that none of the Transaction Parties has
undertaken or will undertake to provide impartial investment advice, or has given or will give advice in a fiduciary capacity in
connection with the Transactions.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these
rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly
important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan,
consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to
such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated
on or about the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, for whom Deutsche Bank
Aktiengesellschaft is acting as representative, on a several and not joint basis, the Notes.

The Initial Purchasers may make offers and sales through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. One or more of
the Initial Purchasers may sell through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Notes in jurisdictions
in which they are not otherwise permitted.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges
in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page
hereof.

The Issuer proposes to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial
offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers
without notice. Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of
the Notes for its own accounts. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to
reject orders in whole or in part. The purchase agreement provides that the obligation of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and
accept delivery of the Notes is subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by our counsel.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company and the Guarantors, on one hand, and the several Initial
Purchasers, on the other hand, will indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act,
and will contribute to payments the other may be required to make in respect thereof. In order to facilitate the Offering, the
Initial Purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the prices of the Notes. Specifically,
the Initial Purchasers may over allot in connection with this Offering, creating a short position in the Notes for their own
accounts. In addition, to cover overallotments or to stabilize the prices of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may bid for, and
purchase, Notes in the open market. Finally, the Initial Purchasers may reclaim selling concessions allowed to a trustee or
dealer for distributing the Notes in this offering if the Initial Purchasers repurchase previously distributed Notes in transactions
to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market
price of the Notes above independent market levels. The Initial Purchasers are not required to engage in these activities, and
may end any of these activities at any time. No assurance can be given that active public markets or other markets will develop
for the Notes or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Notes.

The Company and the Guarantors have agreed or will agree, as applicable, in the Purchase Agreement, that they will
not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their debt securities or any debt securities of our subsidiaries
similar to the Notes during the period beginning on the date of this Offering Memorandum and ending on the date that is
90 days following the closing date of this Offering without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Notes and the related Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (1) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore
transactions in reliance on Regulation S and (2) in the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A. The terms used above
have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, an offer or sale of such Notes within the United
States by a dealer that is not participating in the Offering may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such
offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under
the Securities Act.

The Notes will be new securities for which there are currently no markets. An application will be made for the Notes
to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be traded on the Euro MTF. However, there are no
assurances that the Notes will be, or will remain, listed and admitted to trade on the Euro MTF. Further, the Company cannot
assure you that the initial prices at which the Notes will sell in the market after this offering will not be lower than the initial
offering prices or that active trading markets for the Notes will develop and continue after completion of this Offering. The
Initial Purchasers have advised us that they currently intend to make a market for the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers
are not obligated to do so, and may discontinue any market making activities with respect to the Notes at any time without
notice. In addition, market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the Exchange Act, and may be limited.
Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available any Notes
to any retail investor in the European Economic Area. For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means
a person who is one or more of the following:

(i) a retail client (as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”));

(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II);
or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”).

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available any Notes
to any retail investor in the United Kingdom . For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a
person who is one or more of the following:

(i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of United Kingdom
domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”));

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA
to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in
point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA); or

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of United Kingdom
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

In addition, each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(i) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated
any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received
by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not
apply to the Issuer and the Guarantors, and

(ii) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in
relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with us and routinely hedge
their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their
respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could
adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make
investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial
instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and
instruments. In addition, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may acquire the Notes for their own proprietary account.

The Initial Purchasers may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the
Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representative has repurchased Notes sold
by or for the account of such purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions.

The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment
banking, financial advisory, consulting, commercial banking and other commercial dealings, including as acting as hedge
counterparties with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates
have lending relationships with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates including pursuant to bilateral loan facilities,
multilateral and/or syndicated loan facilities, guarantee, overdraft or cash management facilities and other forms of credit lines.
They have received, and expect to receive, customary fees, commissions and expense reimbursements for these transactions.
Each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders and/or agents under the Senior Facilities Agreement. One
or more of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold 2028 Notes and receive proceeds from this Offering.

The Initial Purchasers are only acting for the Company and the Guarantors in connection with the transaction referred
to in this Offering Memorandum and no one else and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company and the
Guarantors for providing the protections offered to clients of the Initial Purchasers nor for providing advice in relation to the
transaction, this document or any arrangement or other matter referred to herein.

CaixaBank, S.A. is not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC or any other U.S. regulatory authority and will only
offer or sell the Notes either (i) outside the United States, or (ii) in the United States to the extent permitted by Rule 15a-6
under the Exchange Act and/or other applicable U.S. securities laws.

Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and therefore may not make
sales of any securities in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations.
Any offers and sales into the United States by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. will only be made through one or more
U.S. registered broker dealers, or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. law.

Banco de Sabadell, S.A. is not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC or any other U.S. regulatory authority and
will only offer or sell the Notes either (i) outside the United States, or (ii) in the United States to the extent permitted by Rule
15a-6 under the Exchange Act and/or other applicable U.S. securities laws.

Bankinter, S.A. is not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC or any other U.S. regulatory authority and will only
offer or sell the Notes either (i) outside the United States, or (ii) in the United States to the extent permitted by Rule 15a-6
under the Exchange Act and/or other applicable U.S. securities laws.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about    , 2024, which will be the
business day following the date hereof (such settlement being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade on the date of pricing of the Notes or the next
succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an
alternative settlement arrangement at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to
trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any Initial Purchaser that considers itself as a manufacturer
for the purposes of MiFID II (“MiFID II”) (each a “Manufacturer” and, together, the “Manufacturers”), the target market
assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties
and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes
(a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining
the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any Initial Purchaser that considers itself as a manufacturer for
the purposes of the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product
**Governance Rules”) (each a “UK Manufacturer” and, together, the “UK Manufacturers”), the target market assessment in**
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined
in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for
distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending the Notes (a “UK distributor”) should take into consideration the UK Manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a UK distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the UK Manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Neither the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective affiliates have authorized the whole or any part of this
Offering Memorandum and none of them makes any representation or warranty or accepts any responsibility as to the accuracy
or completeness of the information contained in this Offering Memorandum or any responsibility for any act or omission of
the Issuer, the Guarantors or any other person (other than the relevant Initial Purchaser) in connection with the issue and
Offering of the Notes. Neither the delivery of this Offering Memorandum nor the Offering, sale or delivery of any Note shall
in any circumstances create any implication that there has been no adverse change, or any event reasonably likely to involve
any adverse change, in the condition (financial or otherwise) of the Issuer or the Guarantors since the date of this Offering
Memorandum.

**TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS**

The Company has not registered the Notes under the Securities Act and, therefore, the Notes may not be offered or
sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Notes are only to be offered and
sold:

(1) in the United States, to QIBs in compliance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act; and

(2) outside the United States in offshore transactions to purchasers who are not U.S. persons in accordance with
Regulation S.

The term “foreign purchasers” includes dealers or other professional fiduciaries in the United States acting on a
discretionary basis for foreign beneficial owners, other than an estate or trust, in offshore transactions meeting the requirements
of Rule 903 of Regulation S. We use the terms “offshore transaction”, “U.S. person” and “United States” with the meanings
given to them in Regulation S.

If you purchase Notes, you will be deemed to have represented and agreed as follows:

(1) You understand and acknowledge that the Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act or any
other applicable securities laws and that the Notes are being offered for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or any other securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A, and,
unless so registered, may not be offered, sold or otherwise transferred except in compliance with the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, pursuant to an
exemption therefrom, or in a transaction not subject thereto, and in each case in compliance with the
conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (4) below.

(2) You are not our “affiliate” (as defined in Rule 144), you are not acting on our behalf and you are either:

(a) a QIB and are aware that any sale of these Notes to you will be made in reliance on Rule 144A and
such acquisition will be for your own account or for the account of another QIB; or

(b) not a “U.S. person” as defined in Regulation S or purchasing for the account or benefit of a U.S.
person (other than a distributor) and you are purchasing Notes in an offshore transaction in
accordance with Regulation S.

(3) You acknowledge that neither the Company, the Initial Purchasers nor any person representing the Company
or the Initial Purchasers has made any representation to you with respect to the Company or the offer or sale
of any of the Notes, other than the information contained in this Offering Memorandum, which Offering
Memorandum has been delivered to you and upon which you are relying in making your investment decision
with respect to the Notes. You acknowledge that the Initial Purchasers make no representation or warranty
as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offering Memorandum. You have had access to such financial and
other information concerning us and the Notes, including an opportunity to ask questions of, and request
information from, the Company and the Initial Purchasers.

(4) You are purchasing Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor accounts for which you are
acting as a fiduciary or agent, in each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act, subject to any requirement of law
that the disposition of your property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times within
your or their control and subject to your or their ability to resell such Notes pursuant to Rule 144A,
Regulation S or any other available exemption from registration available under the Securities Act. You agree
on your own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which you are purchasing the Notes, and each
subsequent holder of these Notes by its acceptance thereof will agree, to offer, sell or otherwise transfer such
Notes prior to (x) the date which is one year (or such shorter period of time as permitted by Rule 144(k) under
the Securities Act or any successor provision thereunder) after the later of the date of the original issue of
these Notes and the last date on which the Company or any of its affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or
any predecessor thereto) or (y) such later date, if any, as may be required by applicable law (the “Resale
**Restriction Termination Date”) only:**

210


-----

(a) to us;

(b) pursuant to a registration statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act;

(c) for so long as the Notes are eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person you reasonably
believe is a QIB that purchases for its own account or for the account of another QIB to whom you
give notice that the transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A;

(d) pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United States within the
meaning of Regulation S; or

(e) pursuant to any other available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act,

subject in each of the foregoing cases to any requirement of law that the disposition of the seller’s property or the property of
an investor account or accounts be within the seller or account’s control, and in compliance with any applicable state securities
laws.

The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. You
acknowledge that the Company, the Trustee and the registrar reserve the right prior to any offer, sale or other transfer of the
Notes pursuant to clause (d) above prior to the end of the 40-day distribution compliance period within the meaning of
Regulation S or pursuant to clause (e) above prior to the Resale Restriction Termination Date of the Notes to require the delivery
of an opinion of counsel, certifications and other information satisfactory to us, the Trustee and the registrar.

Each purchaser acknowledges that each note will contain a legend substantially in the following form:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
(THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR OTHER SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION.
NEITHER THIS NOTE NOR ANY INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED,

OWNERS OF THIS NOTE (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS NOTE) AND (Y) SUCH LATER DATE, IF ANY, AS
MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW (THE “RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE”), OFFER,
SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER THIS NOTE EXCEPT (A) TO THE ISSUER, (B) PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT,
(C) FOR SO LONG AS THE NOTES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S.

FOR THE ACCOUNT OF ANOTHER QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT
THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT,
(D) PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES TO NON-U.S. PERSONS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES

UPON THE REQUEST OF THE HOLDER AFTER THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE. AS USED
HEREIN, THE TERMS “OFFSHORE TRANSACTION”, “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE
MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT”.

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to holders of
beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these Notes.

(1) You acknowledge that the Registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any Notes
acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the registrar that the restrictions
set forth herein have been complied with.

(2) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Company, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of your
acknowledgements, representations and agreements set forth herein and you agree that, if any of
your acknowledgements, representations or agreements herein cease to be accurate and complete,

not make any offer or sale of these Notes to a U.S. person or for the account or benefit of a U.S. person within
the meaning of Rule 902 under the Securities Act. The “distribution compliance period” means the 40-day
period following the Issue Date for the Notes.

(5) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by the
Company or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to the Company or the

will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under “Plan of Distribution”.

(6) Either (a) you are not acquiring or holding the Notes (or any interest therein) with the assets of (i) an
employee benefit plan that is subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

will not result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.

investment advice, or has given or will give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with the
Transactions

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The original Spanish-language consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin‑Irausa, S.A.U. and its subsidiaries
as of and for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, English translations of which are included in this Offering
Memorandum, have been audited by KPMG Auditores, S.L., independent auditors, as stated in the English translation of their
reports appearing herein.

With respect to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin‑Irausa, S.A.U.
and its subsidiaries as of and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, which are included in this Offering
Memorandum, KPMG Auditores, S.L. have reported that they applied limited procedures in accordance with professional
standards for a review of such information. However, their separate report, included herein, states that they did not audit, and
they do not express an opinion on those interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the degree of
reliance on their report on such information should be restricted in light of the limited nature of the review procedures
applied.The review report covering the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin‑Irausa,
S.A.U. and subsidiaries as of and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 contains (i) an emphasis of matter paragraph
that states that such financial information does not include all the information that would be required in a complete set of
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union and should therefore be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2023 of Grupo Antolin‑Irausa, S.A.U. and its subsidiaries and (ii) an other matter paragraph that states that the
interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 of Grupo Antolin-Irausa,
S.A.U. and subsidiaries were re-issued by the directors and that their limited review report supersedes and replaces their
previous limited review report dated June 25, 2024.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

Each purchaser of the Notes from the Initial Purchasers will be furnished with a copy of this Offering Memorandum
and, to the extent provided to the Initial Purchasers by us for such purpose, any related amendments or supplements to this
Offering Memorandum. Each person receiving this Offering Memorandum and any related amendments or supplements to the
Offering Memorandum acknowledges that:

(a) such person has been afforded an opportunity to request from us, and to review and has received, all additional
information considered by it to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information
herein;

(b) such person has not relied on the Initial Purchasers or any person affiliated with the Initial Purchasers in
connection with its investigation of the accuracy of such information or its investment decision; and

We are not currently subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements of the Exchange Act.

For so long as any of the Notes remain outstanding and are “restricted securities” within the meaning of
Rule 144A(a)(3) under the Securities Act, we will, during any period in which we are neither subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as amended, nor exempt from the reporting requirements under
Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, as amended, make available to the holder or beneficial owner of such restricted securities
or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities designated by such holder or beneficial owner, in each case upon

**ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES AND INSOLVENCY REGIME**

**Spain**

**_Enforceability of civil liabilities_**

The Company and some of the Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain as public limited liability company
(sociedad anónima) with limited liability. The controlling sole shareholder of the Company, and the directors and the executive
officers of the Company and the Guarantors organized under the laws of Spain are nonresidents of the United States and a
significant portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, in order to enforce in Spain
a judgment entered in another jurisdiction, the service of process on such persons or the Company or the Guarantors organized
under the laws of Spain must be made in accordance with the Law 29/2015, of July 30, on international judicial cooperation in
civil matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de cooperación jurídica internacional en materia civil) (the “ILCC Law”) and the
LEC 2000. An investor may also experience difficulty in effecting service of process on or enforcing judgments against such
persons or the Company or the Guarantors organized under the laws of Spain based on civil liability provisions of the U.S.
Federal and state securities laws or other laws.

The United States and Spain are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement
of judgments and accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability would not directly
be recognized or enforceable in Spain, in accordance with and subject to Article 523 LEC 2000. In the absence of any such
treaty such judgment will be recognized and enforced in Spain provided that none of the circumstances set forth in Article 46
of the ILCC concur in them:

    - that the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (“órden público”);

    - that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching the rights of defense of any of the parties and, in
particular, if the judgment has been rendered by default of the defendant (“en rebeldía”) it would be deemed to
breach his rights of defense if the defendant was not regularly and timely notified to enable him to defend himself
properly;

    - that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court jurisdiction does not have a reasonable
connection with the dispute;

    - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with other Spanish judgments;

    - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgment which meets the requirements to be
enforceable in Spain; or

    - that there is an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same subject which was opened
before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings before the foreign court.

According to Article 3.2 of ILCC Law, the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with other state’s authorities
if there has been a reiteration refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s
authorities provided that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes.

The enforcement of any judgments in Spain will be subject to the exequatur process which shall follow, among others,
the following formal requirements pursuant to Article 54.4 of the ILCC Law: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish
must be accompanied by a translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) certain professional fees are required
for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain if needed; (c) the payment of certain court fees; and
(d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain shall be directed by an attorney at law and the party shall be represented by
a court agent with the exception of enforcements of judgments issued in a proceeding in which such direction and representation
is not needed. In addition, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and
will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes.

Pursuant to Article 54 of LEC 2000, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly submit to one judge (juzgado)
or court (tribunal) (provided that under the LEC 2000 and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del

216

_Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute); therefore such article does not_
cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.

The Company and the Guarantors have agreed that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or based upon the
Indenture, the Notes or the Guarantees may be instituted in any federal or state court located in New York City, and the
Company and the Guarantors have appointed Grupo Antolin-North America, Inc. as their agent for service of process in any
such suit, action or proceeding.

**_Insolvency regime_**

Under Spanish insolvency law, your right to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes in case of
insolvency may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws.

The Spanish Insolvency Law governs certain out-of court restructurings or refinancings and court insolvency
proceedings. This section summarizes the main aspects of Spanish insolvency law affecting corporations, and not individuals,
as there are certain specialties for the insolvency of the latest.

_Concept and petition for insolvency_

In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current insolvency (insolvencia actual)
or imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is insolvent when it becomes
unable to regularly meet its obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency) or when it expects that it will be
unable to do so within the next three months (imminent insolvency). A petition for current insolvency may be initiated by the
debtor (voluntary insolvency), by any creditor (provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the
filing of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature) or by certain other
interested third parties (mandatory insolvency). Notwithstanding, only the debtor may file a petition for insolvency on the basis
of its imminent insolvency.

_Voluntary insolvency_

Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor.

The debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become
aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its current insolvency, unless otherwise
proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Failure to file a
petition for insolvency within the statutory two-month period may lead to personal liability of the directors for the unpaid
claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if
the debtor notifies the applicable court that it has initiated or has the intention to initiate negotiations with its creditors to reach
an out-of-court restructuring plan in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Law (the “Opening of Negotiations
**Communication”).**

Effectively, by means of the Opening of Negotiations Communication of Articles 585 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency
Law, in addition to those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-month period to achieve a restructuring plan with its
creditors and one further month to file for the declaration of insolvency unless it is not insolvent at such time. During such
period of time, creditors’ applications for insolvency will not be accepted and enforcement over assets which are necessary for
the continuity of the debtor’s business activities will be prevented or suspended (secured creditors can formally commence
enforcement actions, but enforcement actions will be stayed thereafter). Such three-month grace period could be extended if,
not later than at the end of the initial three-month grace period, either the debtor, or creditors holding more than 50% of the
debts that the restructuring plan may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated claims in an
insolvency situation), may request the court for a three-month extension, provided that the restructuring expert, if appointed,
issues a favorable report in support of such request.

_Mandatory insolvency_

Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party creditor.

Creditors may file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor but must provide evidence of its actual (not only
imminent) insolvency. To this end, creditors must prove to the court that (i) there is a generalized default on payments by the

217


-----

debtor; (ii) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor's assets; (iii) there is a misplacement,
“fire sale” or sale or ruinous liquidation of the debtor's assets; or (iv) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security
and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e., three months). Upon receipt of an insolvency petition
by a creditor, the court may issue provisional interim measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a guarantee
from the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective
measures. However, creditors that acquired debt six months prior to the filing of the petition for insolvency by means of inter
vivos acts and by a singular title after it became due and payable, may not file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor.

_Request of joint insolvency_

The insolvency of a company forming part of a group of companies, including the parent company, does not
automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group, however, creditors may apply for a joint
insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors which are considered legal entities if either (a) there is a confusion of assets
among them, or (b) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or
more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must
in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form
part of the same group.

Any of the debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural consolidation
of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the debtors form part of the same
group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of two or
more of its debtors already declared if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same
group of companies, _provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency_
administrator.

Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated will be processed in coordination, without consolidation of
the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of
the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse
against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be
subordinated).

_Conclusion of insolvency: proposal of agreement or liquidation or payment of the total debt_

The Spanish Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the implementation of
an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (“composition agreement”) or the liquidation of the debtor or payment of
the total debtor’s creditors.

_Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_

The obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security interest might not necessarily be enforced in
accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance. Such enforcement is subject to, _inter alia, the nature of the_
remedies available in the Spanish courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of
such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the LEC 2000 regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under
Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law and other principles of law of general application. Among others:

(i) Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Section 1,152 of the Spanish Civil
Code (Código Civil) establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will
substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of
breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the
debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was
aimed at such partial performance. Spanish law does not foresee punitive or exemplary damages, as they may
run counter to Spanish public policy (orden público). There is doubt as to the enforceability of punitive or
exemplary damages in Spain;

(ii) where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain
to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction;

218


-----

(iii) Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of
one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and
conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties;

(iv) Spanish courts may prevent termination of an agreement if the basis of the breach of obligations, undertakings
or covenants are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant
agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements);

(v) under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek
a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of
law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply.

_Certain effects of the insolvency for the debtor and on contracts_

_On debtors_

As a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency scenario retains its powers to
manage and dispose of its assets, but is subject to the court appointed intervention of the insolvency administrator
(administración concursal) (intervention regime). In case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule and subject to certain
exceptions, the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management's powers (including the power to dispose of assets)
are conferred solely upon the insolvency administrators (suspension regimen). However, the court has the power to modify this
general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency administrator’s request, the
court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa.

Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared
null and void unless ratified by the insolvency administrators.

_On contracts_

A declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending on performance by either
the insolvent party or the counterparty (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the
insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). The court can nonetheless terminate any
such contracts at the request of the insolvency administrators (provided that management's powers have been solely conferred
upon the insolvency administrators), or the company itself (if its powers to manage and dispose of its assets are only subject to
the intervention of the insolvency administrators), when such termination is in the interest of the estate (rejection) (resolución
_del contrato en interés del concurso) or at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract._
The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return, and indemnify damages to its counterpart
against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the insolvent
debtor at its request or the insolvency administrators’ request (assumption) (mantenimiento del contrato en interés del
_concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall be entitled to seek specific performance against the insolvency estate_
(pre-deductible claim from the estate). Lastly, under Section 597 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, all clauses in contracts with
mutual obligations (ipso facto clauses) that entitle any party to modify the obligations or suspend or terminate an agreement
based solely on the other party's declaration of insolvency or by the opening of the liquidation phase of the assets (masa activa)
are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific
laws (i.e., agency laws).

In the event that the debtor, the insolvency administrators and the counterparty agree on the termination of the
agreement and its effects, the insolvency court will agree such termination with the effects agreed between the affected
parties; in the event of lack of agreement between them, if the insolvency court agrees the termination it will also decide the
indemnifications to be received by the non-breaching party due to the termination of the agreement, which will be considered
an insolvency claim (crédito concursal) or a post petition claim (crédito contra la masa) depending on the moment of the
debtor’s breach (if prior the insolvency order, it would give rise to the a insolvency claim, if subsequent to the insolvency
order, it would give rise to a post petition claim).

Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except (i) credit rights
secured with an in rem right, in which case non-default interest accrues up to the value of the security, and (ii) any wage credits
in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding State Budget Act (Ley de Presupuestos
_del Estado)._

219


-----

_On enforcement proceedings_

As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the declaration of insolvency.

The enforcement of any security over certain assets or rights that are necessary for the continuation of the commercial
or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities)may not be commenced (and the procedures already
initiated before the declaration opening insolvency proceedings shall be suspended) until the earlier of: (i) an arrangement of a
composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition agreement does not affect such right; or (ii) one year
having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the liquidation phase.

Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public
auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that
the asset or rights is not considered necessary for the debtor to continue its professional or business activities. When it comes
to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally
embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Finally, enforcement of the
security will be generally subject to the provisions of the LEC 2000 and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable) and this
may entail delays in the enforcement.

_Ranking of credits_

Creditors are required to report their claims to the insolvency administrators within one month from the day following
the last official publication of the court order declaring the insolvency, providing documentation to justify such claims. Based
on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrators draw up
a list of acknowledged creditors/ claims and classify them according to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency
Law.

Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, claims are classified in two groups:

    - Estate Claims (créditos contra _la masa):_ The so-called “estate claims,” are pre-deductible claims from the
estate (excluding those assets of the debtor subject to _in rem security). Debt against the_ insolvency estate
includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) certain costs and expenses of the
insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the debtor under reciprocal
contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after the insolvency of the debtor is declared (including
the amounts payable as a consequence of the breach of contract by the insolvent debtor if such breach takes place
after the declaration of its insolvency), (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the
insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by
it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the noncontractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion (or
from the non-contractual liability before the declaration of insolvency due to death or personal damages), (vi) in
case of liquidation, the credits granted to the bankrupt before the opening of the liquidation phase, to finance
compliance with the viability plan (plan de viabilidad) to support the composition agreement, including claims
granted by “specially related parties” to the debtor if the maximum claims and the details of the relevant creditor
are included in the composition agreement, and (vii) in case of subsequent insolvency, 50% of the amount of
credits arising from internal financing or new financing granted within the framework of a court-sanctioned
restructuring plan, provided that such plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or
more than 60% where finance is provided by specially related parties, after deducting their claims). These claims
are preferred to all others except for specially privileged claims specifically with regard to the assets
(collateral) subject to the relevant security interest or special privilege. Estate claims are not subject to
ranking and, in principle, must be paid as and when they fall due.

    - Insolvency Claims (créditos concursales). Insolvency claims are classified as follows:

– Specially Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio especial): Creditors benefiting from special privileges,
representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security
(in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset minus those
claims that hold higher ranking security over such asset). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their
security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special
privileges may entail separate enforcement proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from

220


-----

a waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish
Insolvency Law. As a general rule, privileged creditors are not subject to the composition agreement unless
they give their express support by voluntarily acceding to the composition agreement and if certain
majorities have been reached among privileged creditors (see “—Conclusion of insolvency—Settlement”).
In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are secured
up to the value of the security. However, the administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the
securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules.

– Generally Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio general): Creditors benefiting from a general privilege,
including, among others, specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities
are recognized for half their amount, and claims held by the creditor taking the initiative to apply for the
insolvency proceedings, for up to 50% of the amount of such debt (except if they rank as subordinated
claims). New funds under a court-sanctioned restructuring plan in the amount not admitted as a debt against
the insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) are also credits with general privileges provided that such
plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is
provided by specially related parties, after deducting their claims). As a general rule and except as set forth
below (see “—Conclusion of insolvency—Settlement”), the holders of general privileges will be affected by
the composition agreement only if they have been authors of the proposal or if they have adhered to it,
unless they have revoked the adhesion, as well as if they adhere to the agreement in a form already accepted
by the creditors or approved by the judge before the judicial declaration of compliance.

– Ordinary Claims (créditos ordinarios) Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) are
paid pro rata once estate claims and privileged claims have been paid.

– Subordinated Claims (créditos subordinados): Subordinated claims are classified contractually or pursuant
to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special
relationships with the debtor. In the case of a legal entity, this includes directors (whether duly appointed
or “de facto” acting as such —administradores de hecho) and those holding general powers of attorney
(including those that have held such positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration),
group companies pertaining and their common shareholders, and any shareholders holding over 5% (for
listed companies) or 10% (for non-listed companies) of the entity’s share capital. Notwithstanding the
above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors
pursuant to a restructuring plan entered into in compliance with the Spanish Insolvency Law shall not be
considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a
result of the financing granted under such restructuring plan. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the
contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are
presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place
within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open.

Claims related to accrued and unpaid interest, unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem right, are
also subordinated. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors; they are not entitled to accede to the
composition agreement and in the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in
the Spanish Insolvency Law (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full).

Subordinated creditors have limited chances of collecting payment according to the ranking established in the
Spanish Insolvency Law.

As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings and, therefore, such
proceedings can have an effect on the estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined
in Royal Decree Law 5/2005, of March 11, 2005)). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors,
the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally
authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil,
labor, or administrative law).

221


-----

_Hardening periods_

There is no claw-back date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become
void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the insolvency administrators must expressly challenge
those transactions that are considered detrimental to the insolvency estate. Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, upon the
declaration of insolvency, only transactions that could be deemed as having damaged (perjudiciales) the debtor’s estate (i.e.,
causing a so-called “patrimonial damage”) carried out during the two years prior to the date of filing for the insolvency
proceedings (and between the petition date and the opening of the insolvency proceedings), may be challenged, even if there
was no fraudulent intention. Transactions taking place earlier may be rescinded subject to ordinary Spanish Civil Code based
actions.

Detrimental transactions carried out by the debtor two years before it files notice of negotiations with creditors can
also be set aside together with those transactions carried out from that date until the opening of insolvency proceedings,
provided that the court has not approved a restructuring plan and opens insolvency proceedings for the debtor in the year after
the pre-bankruptcy protection is no longer in effect.

The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.” Damage does not refer to the
intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in the damage to the debtor’s
estate or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (pars condition
_creditorum). There are several “irrebuttable presumptions” expressly set forth by the Spanish Insolvency Law (i.e., free_
disposals and prepayment or cancellation of the company’s claims or obligations prior to them being due and where the due
dates of the relevant claims or payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of insolvency, except if such obligations
were secured by an in rem security, in which case such transactions are subject to a rebuttable presumption of “patrimonial
damage” as set forth below). In addition to the above, the Spanish Insolvency Law sets forth certain actions which are deemed
to cause a “patrimonial damage” to the debtor, but which are “rebuttable presumptions” and therefore subject to being contested
by the other party (i.e., disposals in favor of “specially related parties” (personas especialmente relacionadas) the provision of
security in respect of previously existing obligations or in respect of new obligations replacing existing ones and the payment
or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an in rem security and which mature after the declaration of insolvency).
Ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are
carried out at arm’s length.

In any event, fraudulent acts that have been entered into by creditors may always be rescinded and also those payments
made by the debtor in respect of obligations which the debtor, at the time of payment, could not be compelled to pay. The
consequence of the court resolution rescinding a prejudicial act is that the parties involved are required to return their reciprocal
consideration with any accrued rents or interest.

As explained below, interim financing and new financing granted by new or pre-existing lenders in the framework of
a court-sanctioned restructuring plan and actions and transactions considered reasonable and necessary for the successful
negotiation and implementation of the plan will be protected against insolvency claw-back actions, provided that the plan
affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60%, after deducting their claims, where finance
has been provided by specially related parties).

_Conclusion of insolvency_

_Settlement_

Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Law encourages creditors to reach
an agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. This agreement may be proposed either by the debtor or by the
creditors, and it shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, this agreement must
be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors.

The settlement or composition agreement should contain proposals for write-offs and/or stays for a period shorter than
10 years according to Article 317 of the Spanish Insolvency Law and it may also contain alternative or complementary
proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of debt into shares,
into profit-sharing credits convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt.
It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets to a specific person with a commitment from the
acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the settlement agreement.

222


-----

The proposals in the settlement shall include a payment schedule.

In order for a settlement or composition agreement to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities
shall be met:

(i) In case the composition agreement contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims;
to stay on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount for a period not exceeding five
years; more than 50% of the ordinary claims must accede to such settlement or composition agreement.
Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority will suffice when the composition agreement consists of (i) full
payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate
repayment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write off of less than 20%.

(ii) If the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, it will be required that at least
the 65% of the ordinary creditors must accede to the composition agreement.

The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not
entitled to accede to the composition agreement.

Although in principle secured and privileged creditors are not subject to an approved composition agreement
(unless they have expressly voted in its favor or adhered thereto) the effects of an approved composition agreement
can be extended to secured and privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition agreement of creditors has
been approved by the majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors,
financial creditors or others):

(i) if the composition agreement contains the full payment of ordinary claims within a period not exceeding
three years or the immediate payment of outstanding claims applying a write off of less than 20%, a write-off
(or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than
five years or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for a period no longer than five years, at
least 60% of privileged creditors have acceded to the composition agreement; and

(ii) in case the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, 75% of privileged
creditors must accede to the composition agreement.

_Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements_

If a debtor and certain of its creditors enter into a restructuring plan meeting the requirements of the Spanish
Insolvency Law and it is therefore sanctioned by the court, the plan can be imposed on dissenting creditors (or classes
of creditors) and shareholders.

The debtor must be currently or imminently insolvent or in a situation of likelihood of insolvency
(probabilidad de insolvencia) (i.e., where the debtor foresees that it may be unable to meet its obligations as they fall
due over the next following two years in the absence of the implementation of a restructuring plan).

Restructuring plans are defined very broadly. They may alter the structure or terms of the debtor’s assets,
liabilities or equity and may also include transfers of assets, business units or the whole company, as well as measures
of operational reorganization. In addition, any claim may be affected by the plan (not only financial claims), except
for maintenance claims (créditos de alimentos), those arising in tort and claims by employees other than senior
management.

Affected creditors must be placed in classes and the Spanish Insolvency Law contains the distinction between
plans that are approved by all classes (the so-called consensual plans) and those that are not (known as non-consensual
plans or cross-class cram down). It is also possible to impose a restructuring plan on shareholders where measures
would otherwise need to be approved by a general meeting and the shareholders have voted against them (or the
general meeting does not take place), but only where the debtor is in a situation of ‘current’ or ‘imminent’ insolvency,
not a ‘likelihood of insolvency.’ Spanish Insolvency Law states that classes must be based on the shared interest of
each of the creditors. As a general rule, claims with different rankings will be placed into separate classes. In addition,
claims that rank pari passu may be split into different classes where, for example, possible conflicts of interest arise,

223


-----

claims are of a financial or other nature, specific claims may be affected differently by the plan or, in the case of
secured claims, the different nature or type of the secured assets.

Required majorities for the approval of a restructuring plan:

(a) Consensual plans (approved by all classes of creditors and by shareholders) will be considered approved if,
within each class, they are voted for by more than 2/3 of creditors by value of the debt (or 3/4 of the debt in
classes formed by secured creditors).

There are special rules for syndicated claims so as to allow the syndicate to be taken fully into account, provided the
above majorities, as applicable, vote in favor (or the contractual majorities, if lower).

(b) Non-consensual plans (not approved by all classes of creditors or by shareholders) must be approved either
by a simple majority of classes (including at least one class comprised of preferential or secured creditors) or
by at least one class that is considered to be ‘in the money.’ A class of creditors can be presumed to be “in
the money” if, further to the valuation of the business as a going concern by the restructuring expert, it is
considered that such class would have received payment.

As an exception to the above, even where the plan has been sanctioned by a court, if dissenting creditors hold
security and belong to a class in which fewer creditors voted for the plan than against, such creditors may enforce their
security within one month following the publication of the order sanctioning the plan. The plan may allow creditors
to accept a cash payment for the portion of the claim covered by the value of the security within 120 days, in lieu of
enforcing their security.

Dissenting creditors affected due to a cram-down will preserve their rights against those who granted personal
guarantees or security. As an exception, restructuring plans for one company in a group may be extended to security
or guarantees from other group companies not a party to the plan, if it is argued that enforcement/payment of
guarantees could cause both the guarantor and debtor to become insolvent.

Other effects of court-sanctioned restructuring plans are:

(a) interim financing and new financing granted by new or pre-existing lenders in the framework of a courtsanctioned restructuring plan and actions and transactions considered reasonable and necessary for the
successful negotiation of the plan and for the implementation of the same will be protected from potential
insolvency claw-back actions, provided that the plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total
liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is provided by specially related parties, after deducting their
claims);

(b) interim financing and new financing granted by new or pre-existing lenders in the framework of a courtsanctioned restructuring plan will be classified in possible insolvency proceedings as estate claims (créditos
_contra la masa) (as to 50% of the claim) and as generally privileged claims (créditos con privilegio general)_
(the remaining 50%), provided that the plan affects the same claims as described in paragraph (a) above; and

(c) possibility of terminating agreements with outstanding reciprocal obligations, senior management contracts
and swap agreements in the interest of the restructuring.

_Liquidation_

Liquidation is conceived as an outcome subsidiary to settlement. It operates when a composition agreement is not
reached, it is breached or when it is decided upon by the insolvency court. The insolvent company is entitled to request the
liquidation at any time and, in any event, it must file a petition for liquidation if, during the period while the settlement is in
force, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval
of such settlement. In such a case, the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed.
Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits.

The Spanish Insolvency Law contains certain general rules of liquidation to be followed by the insolvency
administrator, which can be modified or replaced by the judge on a case-by-case basis, subject to a hearing of or report from

224


-----

the insolvency administrator (special rules). The insolvency administration is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and
has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint a different insolvency
administration pursuant to Article 427 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law.

_Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_

Under Spanish law, in addition to the insolvency claw-back action, the insolvency administrator and any creditor may
bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against the debtor and the third party which is
a party to such contract or agreement, provided that the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot
obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that
the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action:

    - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt
was created;

    - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party;

    - such act was fraudulent;

    - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and

    - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate
making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim.

The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish
law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil): (i) agreements by
virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who
have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment
(mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a _iuris et de iure_
presumption (i.e., it cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum
presumption (i.e., it is a rebuttable presumption).

If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration
received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry
out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the
contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages.

_Set-off_

The Spanish Insolvency Law generally prohibits set off of the credits and debts of the insolvent company once it has
been declared insolvent, but the set off of credits and debts required in order to operate that were agreed before the declaration
of insolvency can still apply. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-à-vis the insolvent company if
the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under its insolvency scenarios, or where the
debts and credits of the insolvent party arise from the same legal relationship.

**Limitations on Validity and Enforcement of the notes and the guarantees and collateral under Spanish law**

In case of any claims brought against the issuer and the Spanish guarantors before Spanish courts, the obligations of
the issuer and the guarantors under the notes and the guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their
respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in
the Spanish courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay
proceedings and the availability of defenses. In this regard:

    - Spanish law does not possess the concept of “indemnity” in contracts, and the specific reception of this common
law notion in the Spanish legal system is still subject to a degree of uncertainty. Spanish law recognizes explicitly
liquidated damages provisions, as well as penalty provisions (both dimensions fall within the Spanish term
_cláusula penal). Article 1152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that a cláusula penal agreed by the parties,_
unless otherwise determined by the agreement, will be deemed as a substitute for damages (indemnización de

225


-----

_daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach. Spanish courts may modify an_
agreed cláusula penal on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed the obligations for
whose complete breach the cláusula penal was foreseen in the contract. Other grounds for the modification of a
_cláusula penal are possible but exceptional._

- Spanish law does not know punitive or exemplary damages, in contract or in tort. On non-contractual grounds,
the excessive nature of the punitive or exemplary damages may run counter to Spanish public policy (orden
_público). In contract, there is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive or exemplary damages._

- Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the
extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. In general, a Spanish court
will take into consideration the overriding mandatory provisions of the jurisdiction where the obligations arising
out of the contract have to be or have been performed, in so far as those provisions render the performance of the
contract unlawful. In considering whether to give effect to those foreign provisions, the court will consider their
nature and purpose and the consequences of their application or non-application.

- A Spanish court will apply the overriding mandatory provisions of the laws of Spain. A Spanish court may refuse
the application of a provision of a foreign law applicable to the contract if the content of such provision is
manifestly incompatible with the public policy (orden público) of Spain.

- Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one
of the contracting parties (Article 1256 of the Spanish Civil Code). Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold
and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving ample discretionary authority to one of the contracting
parties to make binding determinations affecting the other party.

- Spanish law, as construed by the Spanish Supreme Court, sets limits based on good faith to the exercise by one
party of the right to terminate an agreement granted by a provision therein, on the basis of a breach of obligations,
undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings (such as
payment obligations under financing agreements), foreseen under the relevant agreement.

- A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default underlying
the decision to accelerate were only of minimal or trivial importance. Acceleration, in principle, is to be associated
with a material default. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be
left to the sole discretion of one party as this would infringe Article 1256 of the Spanish Civil Code. It may not
be disregarded that the enforcement of a guarantee or collateral granted by a Spanish guarantor could require a
judgment to be previously rendered in New York declaring the default or acceleration of the secured obligations
and the amount due and payable thereunder.

- Reasonability and justification of risk associated with a guarantee or a security interest. The interpretations of the
laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of Spanish Guarantors to guarantee the Notes. Although the law
does not establish any limit, certain case law indicates (and certain scholars understand) that risks associated with
a guarantee or a security interest provided by a company to secure the indebtedness held by other companies
within its corporate group shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s
own perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such guarantor and all this must be evidenced to the
judge.

- Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years since the obligation becomes enforceable being
the general term established for obligations in personam) or may be or become subject to the defense of set off or
counterclaim. In addition, an extension of maturity granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the
guarantor extinguishes the guarantee.

- To this effect, Article 1851 of the Spanish Civil Code (a provision whose application may be excluded by
agreement of the guarantor and the creditor) establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without
the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee. The application of this provision is particularly likely
when the extension granted may have some potential negative effect to the recovery rights of the guarantor vis-àvis the debtor.

- In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee must guarantee a primary obligation to which it is ancillary.
The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee agreement, and a guarantee such as the

226


-----

guarantees granted by the Spanish guarantors will be null and void if the obligations it secures are declared null
and void and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the
issuer’s obligations under the notes The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not
be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are
less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor.

- The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination
thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type
enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all
circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts will in any event be
subject to:

(a) the nature of the remedies available in the courts;

(b) damages may be awarded if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable;

(c) Spanish public policy (orden público);

(d) the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), indirect
infringement or circumvention of a mandatory legal rule (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights
(abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, extraordinary unforeseen circumstances, undue
influence (and under some laws in Spain other than the common laws of Spain, unfair advantage),
fraud, duress, abatement and counter-claim; and

(e) potential modifications by a court of the obligations deriving from the Spanish guarantees could be
exceptionally imposed by Spanish courts when deemed necessary to restore the balance between the
obligations of the parties to a contract in the presence of unexpected and exceptional circumstances
directly affecting such balance, and such circumstances (i) were unforeseeable when the guarantees
were executed, (ii) would not have been expressly or implicitly assumed in the objective risk
assessment of the transaction and subjective risk assessment of the parties, and (iii) directly affect the
position of the parties and entail a drastic change in the consideration or the reciprocal obligations
assumed in the contract, to such an extent that strict compliance with the obligations assumed by one
party turns to be nearly impracticable or extremely burdensome.

- The Spanish financial assistance rules set forth in section 143.2 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act regarding
Spanish private limited liability companies (sociedades limitadas) and in section 150 of the Spanish Capital
Companies Act regarding Spanish public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas) provide that Spanish
public limited liability companies cannot grant any type of funds, guarantees or any other financial assistance to
facilitate the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of their parent companies. This prohibition is broader
for private limited liability companies, which cannot provide financial assistance to facilitate the acquisition of
their shares, the shares of their parent companies or the shares of other companies within their corporate group.
In particular, no Spanish guarantor may secure or guarantee any payment, prepayment, repayment or
reimbursement obligation derived from any finance document used, or that may be used, for the purposes of
payment of acquisition debt or the refinancing of the same (for the purposes of sections 143.2, 149 or 150, as
applicable, of the Spanish Capital Companies Act) or the payment of any costs or transaction expenses related to,
or paying the purchase price for, such acquisition of shares.

- In addition, certain defenses available to any additional Spanish guarantors may limit the amount guaranteed
under the guarantees by reference to the net assets and share capital of such Spanish guarantors. Under the Spanish
Capital Companies Act, Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas) and
private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), as well as sociedades comanditarias
_por acciones may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that_
recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to private limited liability companies. Pursuant to
section 401 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act, the issuance by private limited liability companies cannot
exceed an aggregate maximum amount equal to twice its own funds (recursos propios); unless the issue is secured
by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution. There is no
consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the interpretation of Section 401
of the Spanish Capital Companies Act on whether the restriction set out therein should apply not only to the
issuance of notes but also to the guarantee provided by private limited liability companies covering such notes.

227


-----

Additionally, private limited liability companies cannot issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes
convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales).

    - The Spanish Capital Companies Act under its section 160f) establishes that deliberating and deciding on matters
involving the “acquisition, disposal or transfer” of a company’s essential assets falls within the scope of the
general shareholders’ meeting’s jurisdiction (competencia de la junta general). It is presumed that assets are
considered essential when the amount of the transaction exceeds twenty-five percent of the value of the company’s
assets shown in the latest approved balance sheet, although assets under that threshold may be considered essential
as well. In the absence of sufficient and conclusive case law (jurisprudencia), Spanish scholars (doctrina) have
not reached a consensus at the time of this issuance as to whether the creation of encumbrances or liens on essential
assets of a company (such as pledges or mortgages) shall be deemed to be an act of “disposal” for the purposes
of section 160 f) of the Spanish Capital Companies Act and, thus, fall within the scope of the aforementioned
section, or whether it shall not be deemed to be an act of “disposal” and, thus, not fall within the scope of this
section. The second interpretation would allow for the management body of a company —instead of the general
shareholders’ meeting— to deliberate and decide on the creation of encumbrances or liens on essential assets of
a company.

**_Capitalization_**

Under Spanish law there are some provisions in relation to a company’s capitalization which have to be taken into
account when guarantees are enforced. Enforcement of guarantees may cause the amount of the relevant guarantor’s net equity
(patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital and, in such case, the guarantor will need to be wound up (disolverse),
unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its
share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency.

**_On demand or first demand guarantee_**

The structure of on demand guarantees is not specifically regulated in the Spanish Civil Code but their validity and
effectiveness have been reviewed in several judgments and defined by the Spanish Supreme Court (Tribunal Supremo) as
autonomous, independent and abstract (funcionalmente abstractas) guarantees. These judgments acknowledge the validity of
provisions pursuant to which guarantors waive the ability to call on enforceability exceptions different to those arising from
the guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations,
the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) where
the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or in bad faith.

**_Trust and Parallel debt_**

Given that the concept of “trust” and/or “parallel debt” is not recognized under Spanish law, guarantees and security
interests require that the beneficiary of the guarantee/security interests and the creditor to be the same person. Such
guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to
hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. In any proceedings directly brought within the Spanish jurisdiction
against any Spanish guarantor, the concept of “parallel debt” is likely to be questioned by Spanish courts; the issuer is not
aware of any court precedent where a parallel debt constructions has been considered. In any proceedings directly brought
within the Spanish jurisdiction against any Spanish Guarantor or any Spanish security provider, the concept of “parallel debt”
is likely to be questioned by Spanish courts, although there is no precedent where a parallel debt construction has been
considered.

**_Corporate Benefit_**

All acts and transactions performed and carried out by a Spanish company must be in pursuit of and aligned with its
corporate benefit and interest and, in particular, directors have a duty to act in the best interest of the Spanish company, as such
interpretations of the laws of Spain by the Spanish courts may limit the ability of Spanish guarantors to guarantee the notes.
The absence of such a reasonable and justified corporate benefit and interest may constitute grounds to challenge such acts and
transactions. When assessing whether or not directors have acted in the best interest of a Spanish company, only the interest of
such Spanish company are taken into account. Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the group are not always
considered consistent with the best interest of a Spanish company. In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the
Spanish Supreme Court has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the debt of its parent
company or other companies of its group, should receive some kind of consideration or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to
compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of the group. This compensation (i) must be verifiable, even if it is not

228


-----

received simultaneously to the delivery of the guarantee or security; (ii) must be adequate and proportional to the burden
assumed by the relevant company in the interest of its group; and (iii) must have an economic value. Furthermore, the action
or transaction undertaken in the interest of the group must be justified and must not put the solvency of the subsidiary into
jeopardy. Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the group may not always be considered consistent with the
best interest and corporate benefit of a Spanish company.

### Report on Limited Review of Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

To the Sole Shareholder of Grupo Antolfn-lrausa, SAU. commissioned by the Board of Directors

**Introduction ___________________________ _**

We have carried out a limited review of the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial
statements of Grupo Antolfn-lrausa, SAU. (the "Company") and subsidiaries (together the
"Group"). which comprise the statement of financial position at 31 March 2024, and the income
statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of
cash flows for the three-month period then ended, and explanatory notes (all condensed and
consolidated). The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of these interim
condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard
34 "Interim Financial Reporting" as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express
a conclusion on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements based on our limited
review.

**Scope of Review**

We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
"Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity". A
limited review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A limited review is substantially less in scope than an audit carried out in accordance
with legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the accompanying interim condensed
consolidated financial statements.


-----

#### Conclusion _______________________________________________________________

Based on our limited review, which can under no circumstances be considered an audit, nothing has
come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024 have not been
prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS 34),
“Interim Financial Reporting”, as adopted by the European Union.

#### Emphasis of Matter _______________________________________________________

The Company’s Directors have prepared the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial
statements in accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” as adopted by the European
Union. Consequently, as specified in the accompanying note 2 a), these financial statements present
condensed information and do not include all the disclosures required in complete consolidated
financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as
adopted by the European Union. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial
statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the
Group for the year ended 31 December 2023. This matter does not change our conclusion.

#### Other Matter _____________________________________________________________

In note 2 (a) of the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the
Directors state the reasons for the re-issuance of the interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024 of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and
subsidiaries. This limited review report supersedes and replaces our previous limited review report
dated 25 June 2024 issued on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Grupo
Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and subsidiaries originally prepared by the Directors, in which we expressed an
unmodified conclusion.

**Joint operations-**

IFRS 11 defines a joint operation as a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the
arrangement (“joint operators”) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the
arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when
decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

Following an assessment made by the Group, the only joint operation in which the Group is deemed to participate
is International Door Company, B.V., a holding company with registered office in Amsterdam (Netherlands), in
which the Parent has a 50% interest (the cost of this interest amounted to 2,790 thousand euros at 31 March 2024
and 31 December 2023). The other 50% is held by Küster Holding, GmbH, and the financial statements of the joint
operation were proportionately consolidated.

The amounts of the assets and liabilities, and of the revenue and the profit or loss for the three-month period
ended 31 March 2024 contributed by this joint operation are scantly material with respect to the total consolidated
figures for the Group.

**(2)** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED**
**CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**_a)_** **_Basis of presentation of the interim condensed_**
**_consolidated financial statements-_**

In accordance with Final Provision Eleven of Law 62/2003, of 30 December 2003, on Tax, Administrative and
Labour and Social Security Measures, holding companies that are required to prepare consolidated financial
statements and directors' reports, where, at the end of the reporting period, none of the Group companies
has issued securities admitted to trading on a regulated market of any European Union member state, may
opt to present their consolidated financial statements for the years beginning on or after 1 January 2005 either
in accordance with Spanish accounting legislation or in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards previously adopted by the European Union. Accordingly, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. decided to
apply voluntarily, for the first time in 2007, the aforementioned International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union when preparing its consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements for 2023 were prepared by the Parent's Directors in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter, “IFRS-EU”),) and
other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain, applying the basis of consolidation,
accounting policies and measurement bases described in Notes 2 and 3 to those consolidated financial
statements, and, accordingly, present fairly the Group's consolidated equity and consolidated financial position
as at 31 December 2023 and the consolidated results of its operations, the changes in its consolidated equity
and the consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.

The consolidated financial statements of Antolin for 2023 were approved by the Parent's sole shareholder on
10 June 2024.

On 24 June 2024 the Directors of the Parent prepared the Group’s interim condensed consolidated financial
statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024, presenting them in accordance with IAS 34,
Interim Financial Reporting. However, as a consequence of the divestment plan of certain business and assets
executed by the Group during April 2024 and June 2024, and the agreement reached by the Group for the
extension of its syndicated debt in June 2024, on 1 July 2024 the Directors of the Parent have restated the
said interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group for the three-month period ended 31
March 2024, in order to disclose in them the most significant information thereon (Note
2-i), which are presented in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These facts were not
disclosed in the Group's interim condensed consolidated financial statements prepared on 24 June 2024.

Extension of syndicated debt

In June 2024, the Company agreed with its creditor banks to extend the maturity of its Senior Facilities
Agreement until June 2029. The agreement includes more than 500 million euros in syndicated debt plus
a revolving credit facility.

The financial cost has been set at Euribor plus a credit spread that will vary from 250 to 400 basis points
depending on the company’s financial leverage. The agreement gives Antolin’s financial structure more
flexibility and strength for years to come.

Divestment plan

On 26 June 2024, the Company has signed an agreement to sell 45% of Ototrim Panel Sanayi ve Ticaret,
A.S., (the Company held 50% of the entity, see note 1) supplier of the largest vehicle manufacturers in
the Turkish market, to its partner Diniz Holding. The Company will raise 45 million euros through this
transaction. The Company, which after the sale will hold 5% of entity, will continue to work with its
Turkish partner going forward. This transaction is expected to generate a profit of 28 million euros in
the condensed consolidated income statements of the Group, which will be recognized in the financial
year 2024.

In addition, on 28 June 2024 the Company has signed an agreement with Grupo Cosmos, a Spanish
automotive supplier with a long and proven track record in the auto industry, to sell its trunk trim
business for 31 million euros. The non-core activity sold includes the manufacturing and assembly
operations focused on trunk trim in Alabama (US) and Silao (Mexico) as well as factories of Kecskemet
(Hungary) and Rastatt (Germany) and a technical office in Austria, primarily focused on this activity. In
total, more than 400 employees are transferred in the business sold. This transaction is expected to
generate a loss of 15 million euros in the condensed consolidated income statements of the Group, which
will be recognized in the financial year 2024.

As of this date these two transactions are pending closure of certain regulatory issues.

Additionally, on 28 June 2024, the Company has signed sale and leaseback operations at two centers in
Spain and Morocco for a joint value of 17.1 million euros. On 11 April 2024, the Company completed
another sale and leaseback operation at one center in Spain of 6.2 million euros. Finally, in June 2024, the
Company sold a building for 0.5 million euros in France. The results in the condensed consolidated income
statements of the Group generated by these transactions were not significant.

**_j)_** **_Discontinued operations-_**

A discontinued operation is a business unit that it has been decided to abandon and/or sell whose assets,
liabilities and net profit or loss can be distinguished physically, operationally and for financial reporting
purposes. The income and expenses of discontinued operations are presented separately in the condensed
consolidated income statement.

No Antolin business unit or segment was discontinued in the first three months of 2024.

**_k)_** **_Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows-_**

The following terms are used in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows (prepared using the
indirect method) with the meanings specified:

Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, which are short-term, highly liquid
investments that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

## Independent Auditor's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

_(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)_

To the Sole Shareholder of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U.

##### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### Opinion 

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. (the
“Parent”) and subsidiaries (together the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all
material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group at 31
December 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the
year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in
Spain.

#### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in
Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
_Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those
regarding independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements
pursuant to the legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. We have not provided any nonaudit services, nor have any situations or circumstances arisen which, under the aforementioned
regulations, have affected the required independence such that this has been compromised.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.


-----

#### Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|Recoverable amount of non-current assets See notes 2e), 3a), 3b), 3c), 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2|
|---|---|
|Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|At 31 December 2023 the Group has intangible assets with a carrying amount of Euros 374,616 thousand, property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of Euros 624,429 thousand and goodwill with a carrying amount of Euros 90,836 thousand allocated to the pertinent cash-generating units. At 31 December 2023 impairment of Euros 110,589 thousand has been recognised on intangible assets and Euros 64,202 on property, plant and equipment, of which Euros 24,470 thousand and Euros 3,987 thousand, respectively, were recognised in 2023. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of goodwill annually and tests property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for indications of impairment, for the purposes of determining their recoverable amount. The Group has calculated the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for which it has identified indications of impairment by applying valuation techniques that require the exercising of judgement and the use of assumptions by management and the Directors. Due to the high level of judgement and the uncertainty associated with these assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, their measurement has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Assessing the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of estimating the recoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets. - Assessing the criteria used by the Directors and Group management when identifying indications of impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill. - Evaluating the methodology and assumptions used by management and the Directors to estimate the recoverable amount applying the discounted cash flow method at cash-generating unit level, with the involvement of our valuation specialists. - Comparing the cash flow forecasts estimated in prior years with the actual cash flows obtained. - Contrasting the information contained in the model used to calculate the recoverable amount with the Group's business plans approved by management. - Analysing the sensitivity of the estimated recoverable amount to changes in the relevant assumptions and judgements, such as the discount rate and the expected future growth rate used to estimate future cash flows. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.|


-----

|Capitalisation of development expenses See notes 2e), 3b) and 7 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2|
|---|---|
|Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|In 2023 the Group capitalised development expenses amounting to Euros 106,603 thousand and at 31 December 2023 the Group has capitalised total development expenses of Euros 308,095 thousand under other intangible assets. The capitalisation of development expenses requires an analysis of compliance with the requirements laid down in the financial reporting framework. If there are reasonable doubts as to the technical success or economic-financial feasibility of the projects, the amounts recognised as assets should be taken directly to the consolidated income statement, and therefore there is a risk that the capitalised costs would not meet the criteria set forth in the financial reporting framework for their capitalisation. Due to the judgement associated with the foregoing assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, capitalisation of such costs as development expenses has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Evaluating the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of recognising development expenses and identifying, where applicable, the expenses that qualify for capitalisation. - Performing tests of detail for a sample of capitalised development expenses, corroborating the amounts capitalised and analysing the supporting documentation prepared by management and which substantiates the technical success and economic-financial feasibility of the projects, assessing the reasonableness of the main assumptions considered. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the reporting requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.|


#### Other Information: Consolidated Directors’ Report 

Other information solely comprises the 2023 consolidated directors' report, the preparation of which
is the responsibility of the Parent's Directors and which does not form an integral part of the
consolidated financial statements.

Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not encompass the consolidated
directors' report. Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated directors’
report is defined in the legislation regulating the audit of accounts, as follows:

a) Determine, solely, whether the consolidated non-financial information statement has been
provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, and if not, to report on this matter.

b) Assess and report on the consistency of the rest of the information included in the consolidated
directors’ report with the consolidated financial statements, based on knowledge of the Group
obtained during the audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements. Also, assess
and report on whether the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated directors’
report are in accordance with applicable legislation. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report them.


-----

Based on the work carried out, as described above, we have observed that the information
mentioned in section a) above has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable
legislation, that the rest of the information contained in the consolidated directors’ report is
consistent with that disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for 2023, and that the
content and presentation of the report are in accordance with applicable legislation.

#### Directors' and Audit Committee's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Parent's Directors are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in such a way that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity,
consolidated financial position and consolidated financial performance of the Group in accordance
with IFRS-EU and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in
Spain, and for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's Directors are responsible for
assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do
so.

The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the preparation and presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain,
we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We
also:

#### – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.


-----

#### – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

#### – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting
estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent's Directors.

#### – Conclude on the appropriateness of the Parent's Directors' use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists
related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue
as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw
attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

#### – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair
view.

#### – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the audit committee of the Parent regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Parent's audit committee with a statement that we have complied with the
applicable ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and to communicate with
them all matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where
applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated to the audit committee of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U., we
determine those that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter.

#### Additional Report to the Audit Committee of the Parent  

The opinion expressed in this report is consistent with our additional report to the audit committee

31 December 2023 were used. For the remaining companies the individual financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2023 were used. The figures in the above tables correspond to the financial position at 31 December
2023.

**Audit of the individual financial statements of the**
**subsidiaries-**

The individual financial statements for 2023 of most of the subsidiaries are audited when local legislation so
requires by KPMG or other auditors. Set out below are the subsidiaries whose financial statements are examined

**Associates and joint ventures-**

“Associates” are defined as companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence.

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but
not control or joint control over those policies.

IFRS 11 defines a joint venture (as opposed to a joint operation as described in the next section of this note) as a
joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (“joint venturers”) have rights
to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed upon sharing of control over an
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the
parties sharing control.

The Group's holdings in associates and joint ventures (accounted for in the consolidated financial statements for
2023 and 2022 using the equity method), and the corresponding book values recognised under “Investments in
companies accounted for using the equity method” in the consolidated statements of financial position at 31
December 2023 and 2022, are as follows:

December 2023 they were accounted for using the equity method because Antolin did not exercise effective control over them at that
date.

(b) At 31 December 2022, International Door Company, B.V. (in which the Group has a 50% stake) held all of the shares of Slovakian
Door Company, s.r.o. Therefore, at 31 December 2022, the Group indirectly held 50% of the share capital of this company, which is
classified as an “associate”. However, in 2023 this company was excluded from the Group’s scope of consolidation.

(a) In 2023 the Group received dividends from Dongwon Technology Co., Ltd. and Krishna Grupo Antolin

Private, Ltd., for amounts of 119 and 399 thousand euros, while in 2022 the Group received dividends
from these companies of 89 and 333 thousand euros, respectively.

Part of the balances of the heading “Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method” in the
accompanying consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2022 includes an amount of 3,750
thousand euros, for a long-term loan granted by the Group to the associate Slovakian Door Company, s.r.o. (see
Note 21), which was excluded from the scope of consolidation in 2023.

**Financial year and audit of the individual financial statements of associates**
**and joint ventures included in the scope of consolidation-**

The financial year of associates and joint ventures is the same as the calendar year, except for Krishna Grupo
Antolin Private, Ltd., whose financial year ends on 31 March. For Krishna Grupo Antolin Private, Ltd., the financial
statements for the 12-month period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 were used. For the remaining
companies, the individual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 were used. Some of the
aforementioned financial statements are currently being examined by the following auditors:

**Joint operations-**

IFRS 11 defines a joint operation as a joint agreement under which the parties that have joint control (“joint
operators”) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control
is the contractually agreed sharing of control which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require
the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.

Following an assessment by the Group, the only joint operation in which the Group is deemed to operate is
International Door Company, B.V., a holding company registered in Amsterdam (Netherlands), in which the
Parent has a 50% stake (the cost of this interest amounted to 2,790 and 9,658 thousand euros at 31 December
2023 and 2022, respectively). The other 50% is held by Küster Holding, GmbH, and this company's financial
statements have been proportionately consolidated.

The amounts of the assets and liabilities, and of the net turnover and the profit or loss for 2023 contributed by
this joint venture are scantly material with respect to the total consolidated figures for the Group.

**(2)** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATION**
**STANDARDS**

**a) True and fair view-**

In accordance with Final Provision Eleven of Law 62/2003 on Tax, Administrative and Social Order Measures,
of 30 December, companies with holdings are required to draw up consolidated financial statements and
directors' reports. At year-end none of the companies in the Group had issued shares that are listed on an
official market of any Member State of the European Union. They may therefore opt to present their
consolidated financial statements for the years beginning on or after 1 January 2005 in accordance with
Spanish accounting standards or in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted
by the European Union. Accordingly, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. has decided to voluntarily apply, for the
first time in the financial year 2007, said International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European
Union when drawing up its consolidated financial statements.

The consolidated financial statements for 2023, which were prepared from the individual accounting records
of the Parent and of the companies included in consolidation (listed in Note 1), are presented in accordance
with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (hereinafter referred to
as "IFRS-EU") and, accordingly, give a true and fair view of the Group's consolidated net worth, consolidated
financial position at 31 December 2023, results of operations, and changes in consolidated equity and cash
flows arising in the year then ended.

These consolidated financial statements for 2023 have been authorised for issue by the Parent's Directors
and will be submitted for approval by the Parent's Sole shareholder, and it is considered that they will be
approved without any changes.

The consolidated financial statements for 2022 were approved by the Parent's sole shareholder on 27 April
2023.

**b) Adopting new standards and interpretations issued-**

Antolin's consolidated financial statements for the year-ended 31 December 2023 were drawn up in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, in accordance with the terms of Regulation (EC)
No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council dated 19 July 2002, taking into account all
mandatory accounting principles, standards and measurement bases with a material impact and the
alternatives permitted under the standards in this respect.


**Standards and interpretations in force in 2023**


The consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with the IFRS-EU and consider the rules,
amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union into force at 1 January 2023, as follows:


-----

|Standards, amendments and interpretations:|Col2|Effective from:|
|---|---|---|
|Approved for use in the European Union|||
|New standards: IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts and amendments thereto (standard issued in May 2017 and amendments in June 2020 and September 2022) Amendments: Amendment to IAS 1, Disclosure of Accounting Policies (issued in February 2021) Amendment to IAS 8, Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued in February 2021) Amendment to IAS 12, Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (issued in May 2021) Amendment to IFRS 17, Insurance Contracts. Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 - Comparative Information Amendments to IAS 12. International Tax Reform-Pillar Two Model Rules|Supersedes IFRS 4 and establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts, the objective being to ensure that entities provide relevant and reliable information that gives a basis for users of the financial information to assess the effect that insurance contracts have on the financial statements. Amendments that enable entities to adequately identify the information about material accounting policies that must be disclosed in the financial statements. Amendments and clarifications about what is to be understood as constituting a change in an accounting estimate. Clarifications regarding how entities must recognise the deferred tax arising on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. Modification of the transition requirements of IFRS 17 for insurers that simultaneously apply IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 for the first time. These amendments introduce a temporary exemption from the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities under IAS 12 in relation to the entry into force of the Pillar Two tax rules. They also include additional disclosure requirements.|1 January 2023 1 January 2023 1 January 2023 1 January 2023 1 January 2023 1 January 2023|


These amendments have not had a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements at 31
December 2023.

In relation to the amendments to IAS 12 relating to the entry into force of the Pillar Two tax rules, at the
date of formal preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the applicable legislation for the Pillar
Two rules had not yet come into force in Spain. In this connection, in 2023 the Group applied the mandatory
temporary exception set out in this connection in the amendments to IAS 12 indicated in the above table to
the requirements that an entity does not recognise and does not disclose information about deferred tax
assets and liabilities relating to the current tax reform (see Note 19).

**Standards and interpretations issued effective on or after 1**
**January 2024-**

The new standards pending EU approval whose application is not obligatory in 2023 and that will enter into
force as of the reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2024 are detailed below:


-----

|Standards, amendments and interpretations:|Col2|Effective from:|
|---|---|---|
|Approved for use in the European Union|||
|Amendments: Amendments to IFRS 16, Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (issued in August 2022) Amendment to IAS 1. Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non- current and of those subject to covenants|These amendments indicate that the seller-lessee must measure the value of the lease liability in such a way that it recognises no gain or loss relating to the retained right of use. Clarifications relating to the presentation of liabilities as current or non-current and in particular of those with a maturity conditional upon compliance with covenants.|1 January 2024 1 January 2024|
|Not approved for use in the European Union|||
|Amendments: Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS7, Financing Agreements with Suppliers Amendments to IAS 21. Exchangeability|These amendments establish specific disclosure requirements regarding supplier finance arrangements and the effects of those arrangements on the entity’s liabilities and cash flows, including its exposure to liquidity risk and the associated risk management. These amendments establish an approach to be taken when a currency is not exchangeable and, if this is the case, how to determine the exchange rate to be used.|1 January 2024 1 January 2025|


None of the aforementioned standards was applied prior to the mandatory effective date in 2023.

The Group is beginning to assess the potential impact of the future application of these standards and, after
a first analysis, estimates that these should not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial
statements.

**c)** **Functional currency-**

The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, which is the Parent's functional
and presentation currency, rounded off to the nearest thousand. Foreign operations are recorded in
accordance with the policies described in Notes 2-f and 3-i.

**d) Comparative information-**

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 1, the information set out in these notes to consolidated financial
statements relating to 2023 is presented, for the purposes of comparison, with the figures for 2022.

There have been no major changes in the accounting policies that affect 2023 and 2022. Neither have any
corrections of errors relating to prior years been made, nor have any major changes been made in the
accounting estimates that affect these financial years or that are likely to affect future financial years.

**e) Responsibility for the information provided and**

**estimates made-**

The information set out in these consolidated financial statements for 2023 is the responsibility of the
Directors of the Parent.

The consolidated results and the calculation of consolidated net equity are sensitive to the accounting
principles, policies, measurement criteria and estimates used by the Parent's Directors in the preparation of
the consolidated financial statements. The main accounting principles and policies and measurement criteria
used are disclosed in Note 3.


-----

In preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2023, estimates made by the Group's Senior
Management (subsequently ratified by the Parent's Directors) were used on occasion to measure certain
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments recognised in them and that could have a significant
impact over the next twelve months. These estimates, made based on the best information available, refer
to:

    - The assessment of signs of impairment losses in PP&E and intangible assets and calculation of its
recoverable value (Note 8).
    - The assessment of the technical success of the development projects and their profitability (Note 7).
    - The measurement of goodwill (Note 7).
    - The recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 19).
    - The assessment of the capacity to exercise control over some consolidated companies and the timing
thereof (Note 1).

Although these estimates were made based on the best information available at 31 December 2023 for the
events being analysed, future events may make it necessary to revise these estimates (upwards or downwards)
in coming years. Any such changes would be applied prospectively, recognising the effects of the change in
estimate in the consolidated income statements for the years affected, as provided for in IAS 8.

The consolidated financial statements for 2023 were prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of
accounting.

**f)** **Consolidation standards-**

Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries, including structured entities, are those over which the Parent exercises control directly, or
indirectly via subsidiaries. The Parent controls a subsidiary when, through its involvement, it is exposed or
has the right to variable returns by means of the power exercised over it. The Parent has this power if it has
substantive rights in force which enable it to direct the relevant activities. The Parent is exposed, or has the
right, to variable returns for its involvement in the subsidiary when the returns it obtains through that
involvement may change based on the subsidiary’s economic performance.

A structured entity is one that is designed so that voting and other similar rights are not essential when
determining who controls the entity, e.g., in the event that possible voting rights refer exclusively to
administrative activities and these are governed by contractual agreements.

Subsidiary revenues, expenses and cash flows are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the
date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Group effectively obtains control over them. Subsidiaries
are excluded from consolidation as of the date on which that control is lost.

The transactions and balances with Group companies and unrealised profits or losses have been eliminated
in the consolidation process. However, unrealised losses were considered as a sign of impairment in respect
of the value of the transferred assets.

The accounting policies of the subsidiaries were adapted to the Group's accounting policies for transactions
and other events that are similar and occurred under similar circumstances.

The individual financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the consolidation process refer to the same
reporting date and period as those of the Parent.

The individual financial statements of subsidiaries have been fully consolidated with those of the Parent.


-----

Business combinations
The Group applies the acquisition method in business combinations.

The acquisition date is the one on which the Group obtains control over the business acquired.

The consideration delivered for the business combination is determined on the acquisition date by the sum
of the fair values of the assets delivered, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued
and any contingent consideration dependent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions in
exchange for the control over the business acquired.

The consideration delivered excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the business
acquired. Costs relating to the acquisition are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.

On the acquisition date the Group recognises the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed (and any other noncontrolling interest) at their fair value. The non-controlling interest in the business acquired is recognised at
the amount corresponding to the percentage in the fair value of the net assets acquired. This criterion solely
applies to non-controlling interests that grant present access to financial profits and the right to the
proportional part of the acquired entity's net assets in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling
interests are recognised at fair value or at the value based on market conditions. The liabilities assumed
include contingent liabilities insofar as they represent present obligations arising from past events whose fair
value may be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets allocated by the seller at
the same time and following the same measurement criteria for the indemnification item of the acquired
business, considering the risk of insolvency and any contractual restriction on the indemnified amount, as
appropriate.

The application of this criterion excludes non-current assets or disposable groups of elements classified as
held for sale, liabilities for long-term defined benefits, transactions with payments based on equity
instruments, deferred tax assets and liabilities and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of previously
granted rights.

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are classified and designated for subsequent recognition on the
basis of contractual agreements, financial conditions, accounting and operating policies and other conditions
existing on the acquisition date, with the exception of leases in which the business acquired is the landlord
and of insurance contracts.

Any excess existing between the consideration provided plus the value assigned to the non-controlling
interests and the net amount of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In
relation to any deficiency existing after assessing the amount of the consideration provided, the value assigned
to the non-controlling interests and the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired are
recognised as a separate item in the consolidated income statement.

Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired as of 1 January 2004 are recorded on the acquisition
date by the percentage held in the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in the
subsidiaries acquired before the transition date were recognised by the percentage in equity on the date of
first-time consolidation.

Non-controlling interests are presented in consolidated net equity separately from the equity attributed to
the Parent's shareholders. Non-controlling interests in consolidated profit or loss for the year and in
consolidated total comprehensive income for the year are also presented for the year separately in the
consolidated income statement and in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, respectively.


-----

The Group's interest and the non-controlling interests in the consolidated profit or loss for the year (and in
consolidated comprehensive income for the year) and in changes in net equity of the subsidiaries, after
considering adjustments and eliminations arising from consolidation, are determined from ownership
interests at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and
after deducting the effect of dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights
classified in net equity accounts. However, the Group's interest and the non-controlling interests are
determined considering the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other financial derivatives that
essentially grant current access to the returns associated with ownership of the subsidiaries.

Any excess losses attributable to non-controlling interests generated prior to 1 January 2010, not
attributable to these because they exceed the amount of the interest in the subsidiary's equity, are recorded
as a decrease in net equity attributable to the Parent’s shareholders, except in those cases in which the noncontrolling interests have a binding obligation to assume all or part of the losses and have the ability to make
the necessary additional investment. The profits obtained in subsequent years are assigned to the net equity
attributable to the Parent’s shareholders, until the amount of the losses absorbed in prior reporting periods
that correspond to non-controlling interests has been recovered.

As of 1 January 2010, the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are assigned to
the net equity attributable to the Parent’s shareholders and to non-controlling interests in proportion to
their interest, even if this entails a deficit balance of non-controlling interests. The agreements executed
between the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.

Associates
Associates are those entities over which the Parent exercises significant influence, directly or indirectly via
subsidiaries. Significant influence is the power to participate in an entity's financial and operating policy
decisions, without the existence of control or joint control. In determining the existence of significant
influence, potential voting rights are considered, whether exercisable or convertible on the closing date of
each year, and likewise considering any potential voting rights held by the Group or another entity.

Investments in associates are recorded by the equity method from the date on which the significant influence
is exercised to the date on which the Parent is unable to continue to justify its existence. Nevertheless, if on
the acquisition date all or part of the investment complies with the conditions for classification as non-current
assets or disposable groups of elements held for sale, it will be recorded at fair value less any costs to sell
or of disposal by other means.

Investments in associates are initially recognised at their acquisition cost, additionally including any additional
cost directly attributable to the acquisition and any contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability
that depends on future events or on the fulfilment of certain conditions.

The excess between the investment cost and the percentage corresponding to the Group in the fair values
of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill, which is included in the investment's book value. Any
deficiency, after measuring the amounts of the investment cost and identification and assessment of the
associate's net assets, is recorded as revenue in determining the investor's interest in the associate's profit or
loss for the year of its acquisition.

If the investment results in the loss of control of a subsidiary that does not constitute a business, the cost of
the investment is the fair value, net of any eliminations from the results of the loss of control.

The accounting policies of associates were subject to timing and measurement unification in the same terms
as those referenced for subsidiaries.

The Group's interest in the profits or losses of associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as
an increase or decrease in the value of the investments with a credit or debit to “Profit/(Loss) of companies
accounted for using the equity method” of the consolidated income statement. Likewise, the Group's interest


-----

in profits or losses of associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an increase or decrease in
the value of the investments in the associates, recognising the itemised consideration in other comprehensive
income. Dividend distributions are recorded as decreases in the investment values. The Group's interest in
profits or losses, including impairment losses recognised by the associates, will consider revenue or expenses
deriving from the acquisition method.

The Group's interest in the profits or losses of the associates and in the changes in net equity is determined
on the basis of its ownership interest at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of
potential voting rights. However, the Group's interest is determined considering the possible exercise of
potential voting rights and other financial derivatives which at present essentially grant access to the returns
relating to associate ownership interest.

The Group's interest in the profits or losses of the associates is recorded after considering the effect of the
dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights classified in net equity accounts.

The losses in associates that correspond to the Group are limited to the net investment value, except in
those cases in which the Group has assumed legal or implicit obligations, or has made payments on behalf
of the associates. To recognise impairment losses in associates, the net investment is considered as the result
of adding the book value resulting from the application of the equity method to the one that corresponds to
any other item that essentially forms part of the investment in the associates. Any excess of losses on the
investment in equity instruments is applied to the rest of the items in reverse order of priority on liquidation.
The profits subsequently obtained by those associates in which recognition of losses is limited to the value
of the investment are recorded to the extent that they exceed any losses not previously recognised. The
Group applies financial instrument measurement criteria to the other items that form part of the net
investment and to which the equity method is not applied, prior to recognising the aforementioned losses. In
applying those criteria, the Group does not consider the recognition of losses deriving from the equity
method in the book value of these items. As a result of this, the measurement criteria of those items at fair
value and value impairment, where appropriate, change the recognition of the losses deriving from the equity
method in prior periods and the year underway.

Profits and losses not realised in transactions performed between the Group and associates are only
recognised to the extent that they correspond to unrelated investors' interests. The recognition of unrealised
losses that constitute proof of impairment of the transferred asset are excluded from the application of this
criterion. However, profits and losses deriving from transactions between the Group and associates of net
assets that constitute a business will be recognised in their entirety.

Unrealised profits or losses of non-monetary contributions of assets to associates that do not constitute a
Group business are recorded in accordance with the value of the transactions. In this regard, if the transferred
assets remain in the associate and the transaction is commercial in nature, only the proportional part of the
profits or losses that correspond to the rest of the investors is recognised. Otherwise, no profit or loss is
recognised for the transaction. Deferred profit or loss is recognised against the value of the interest.
Furthermore, unrealised losses are eliminated insofar as they do not constitute proof of impairment of the
transferred asset. If in the non-monetary contribution and in addition to the interest, the Group receives
monetary or non-monetary assets, the profit or loss of the transaction corresponding to the latter is
recognised.

In non-monetary contributions of Group businesses to associates, profits and losses are recognised in their
entirety.

The Group applies the criteria indicated in the financial instrument accounting policy, including any
impairment adjustments to the other financial instruments to which the equity method is not applied,
including those that form part of the net investment in the associate.


-----

The recognition of losses from applying the equity method or impairment of the financial instruments that
form part of the net investment in the associate are not considered in applying the measurement criteria
indicated in the financial instrument policy.

Once the equity method is applied, the Group assesses whether objective evidence of net impairment exists
in the associate.

Calculation of impairment is determined as a result of the comparison of the book value relating to the net
investment in the associate with its recoverable value, with recoverable value deemed to be the greater of
the value in use or fair value less costs to sell or of disposal by other means. In this connection, the value in
use is calculated on the basis of the Group's interest in the present value of the estimated cash flows from
ordinary activities and from any amounts that could result from the final sale of the associate.

The recoverable amount of the investment in an associate is measured with regard to each associate, unless
it is not a cash generating unit (CGU).

The impairment loss is not assigned to goodwill or to other implicit assets in the investment in associates
deriving from the application of the acquisition method. In subsequent years value reversals of investments
are recognised against profit or loss, to the extent that an increase in recoverable value exists. Impairment
loss is presented separately from the Group's interest in associate profit or loss.

Joint agreements
Joint agreements are considered to be those in which a contractual agreement exists to share control over
an economic activity, so that any decisions on relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group
and the rest of the investors or operators. The assessment of the existence of joint control takes place by
considering the subsidiaries' definition of control.

i) Joint operations

In joint operations, the Group recognises its assets in the consolidated financial statements, including its
interest in jointly-controlled assets; its liabilities, including its interest in any liabilities incurred jointly
with other operators; the revenue obtained from the sale of its part of the production deriving from the
joint operation, its part of revenue obtained from the sale of the production deriving from the joint
operation, its expenses, including the part of the joint expenses that corresponds to it.

The Group's acquisition of the initial and subsequent interest in a joint operation constituting a business
is recognised by applying the criteria for business combinations as the percentage interest it holds in the
individual assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, in the subsequent acquisition of additional interest in a joint
operation, the prior interest in the individual assets and liabilities is not subject to revaluation, insofar as
the Group maintains joint control.

In sale or contribution transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit or loss
corresponding to the interest of the rest of the operators is recognised, unless the losses reveal a loss
in value or impairment of the assets transferred, in which case they are recognised in their entirety.

In purchase transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit or loss is recognised when the
assets acquired are sold to third parties, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or impairment of the
assets acquired, in which case the Group recognises the proportional part of any losses that correspond
to it in their entirety.


-----

Transactions and balances in foreign currency
i) Functional and presentation currency

The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, which is the Parent's
functional and presentation currency, rounded off to the nearest thousand.

ii) Transactions, balances and cash flows in foreign currency

Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency by applying the spot
exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency on the dates on which the
transactions take place.

Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into euros by applying the existing rate
at year-end, while non-monetary ones measured at historical cost are translated by applying the
exchange rights applied on the date on which the transaction took place. For these purposes, supplier
and customer advances are considered non-monetary items, whereby they are translated at the exchange
rate on the date on which the payment or collection took place. The subsequent posting of the reception
of inventories or revenue from sales, for the part of the advance, takes place at the original exchange
rate and not the one on the transaction date. Finally, the translation into euros of non-monetary assets
measured at fair value is performed by applying the exchange rate on the date of their quantification.

In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statement, flows from foreign currency transactions
are translated into euros by applying the exchange rates existing on the date on which they took place.
The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are presented
separately in the cash flow statement as “Effect of exchange rate differences on cash”.

The differences revealed in the settlement of transactions in foreign currency and in the translation into
euros of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are recognised in profit or loss. However,
the exchange differences arising in monetary items that form part of the net business investment abroad
are recorded as translation differences in other comprehensive income.

Exchange gains or losses relating to monetary financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are also recognised in profit or loss.

Monetary financial assets denominated in foreign currency classified at fair value with changes in other
comprehensive income, are considered to be posted at amortised cost in the foreign currency and,
therefore, the exchange differences associated with any changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit
or loss and the rest of the change in fair value is recognised as set out in section i).

The Group presents the effect of the translation of deferred tax assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currency jointly with the deferred income tax in profit or loss).

Exchange gains or losses of non-monetary financial assets and liabilities and monetary financial assets
and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit or loss, are recognised jointly with a change
in the fair value in other comprehensive income or in profit or loss. The rest of the change in fair value
is recognised as set out in section i). Nevertheless, the component of the change to the exchange rate
of equity instruments denominated in foreign currency and measured at fair value with changes in other
comprehensive income and classified as fair value hedges of that component, is recognised in other
comprehensive income.


-----

iii) Translation of foreign businesses

The Group availed itself of the exemption in IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards, regarding cumulative translation differences, whereby the translation differences
recognised in the consolidated financial statements generated prior to 1 January 2004 were included in
reserves for cumulative gains. As of that date, the translation into euros of foreign businesses whose
functional currency is not from a hyper-inflationary country was performed by the application of the
following criteria:

    - Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and adjustments to net assets deriving from business
acquisition, including comparative balances, are translated at the closing rate on the date of each
balance sheet;

    - Revenue and expenses, including comparative balances, are translated at the exchange rates in force
on the date of each transaction; and

    - Exchange rate differences resulting from the application of the above criteria are recognised as
translation differences in other comprehensive income;

This same criterion is applicable to the translation of financial statements of companies accounted for
using the equity method, whose translation differences that correspond to the Group's interest are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

In the presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows, including comparative
balances, of foreign subsidiaries and joint businesses are translated into euros by applying exchange rates
existing on the date on which they took place.

Translation differences recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss, as an
adjustment to the profit or loss from the sale, following the criteria set out in the sections on subsidiaries
and associates.

**g) Changes in the scope of consolidation-**

2023:

The changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in 2023 were as follows:

   - The disposal in March 2023 of the ownership interests in the Russian companies Grupo Antolin SaintPetersburg and Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Novgorod, Ltd., which were wholly owned by Antolin.

   - The dissolution and liquidation of the subsidiary Chongqing Zhenneng Antolin Auto Parts, Co., Ltd. in
January 2023 in which Antolin had a 50% stake and which was practically dormant.

   - The disposal in November 2023 of the subsidiaries Antolin Austria Holding, GmbH, a company wholly
owned by the Parent, and Antolin Ebergassing, GmbH, which in turn was wholly owned by Antolin
Austria Holding, GmbH.

##### • Subsequent to the disposal in December 2023 of the subsidiary Slovakian Door Company, s.r.o., in which
Antolin held a 50% stake through the investee International Door Company, B.V., and the acquisition of
an additional 50% stake in the share capital of the Brazilian subsidiary Iramec Autopeças, Ltda. Antolin
now holds all the share capital of this company.


-----

##### • The incorporation of the Indian company Antolin Lighting India Pvt. Ltd. in May 2023, in which the Parent
has a holding of 99.99%, of the Chinese company Shanghai Antolin Automotive Interiors Co., Ltd. in
August 2023 (a subsidiary of Antolin China Investment Co., Ltd. in which it has an ownership interest of
100%), and of the Austrian company Antolin Connect, GmbH in November 2023, which is wholly owned
by the Parent.

##### • The acquisition in May 2023 of 44% of the share capital of the Chinese company Shanghai Antolin-Naen
Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd., for 616 thousand euros, whereby the Parent obtained control of 95%
of the share capital of the aforementioned subsidiary (see Note 5).

- At 31 December 2022, Keyland Sistemas de Gestión, S.L. and Keyland México, S. de R.L. de C.V. were
fully consolidated and at 31 December 2023 they were accounted for using the equity method because
Antolin did not exercise effective control over them at that date.

The detail at 31 December 2022 of the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries disposed of or dissolved in
2023 (which, in the case of Grupo Antolin Saint-Petersburg and Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Novgorod,
Ltd., were presented under “Non-current assets classified as held for sale” and “Other liabilities associated
with non-current assets classified as held for sale”, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statement
of financial position of Antolin at that date) is as follows:

(a) The amounts recognised under “Other operating revenue”, “Other operating expenses” and “Impairment and gains or losses on

disposals of non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement for 2022 of the subsidiaries Grupo Antolin-Saint Petersburg
and Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Nóvgorod, Ltd. which include the amount that Antolin decided to recognise at the end of June 2022
with a charge to “Gains or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests” of the accompanying condensed consolidated
income statement for the six-month period ended 30 June 2022 in view of the circumstances and uncertainties that existed at that
date relating to the realisation of the assets of Antolin in Russia and the settlement of its liabilities which amounted to 16,092
thousand euros.

Revenues and expenses and the profit or loss obtained relating to the companies disposed of and dissolved
in the period from the beginning of 2023 and the date of disposal or dissolution thereof, were scantly
material, as were net changes in the assets and liabilities of those companies over the same period, with the
exception of Antolin Ebergassing, GmbH, the revenue and accumulated loss before taxes of which at the
date of disposal amounted to 132,637 and 3,937 thousand euros, respectively.

As a result of the disposal in 2023 of Grupo Antolin-Saint Petersburg, Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny
Nóvgorod, Ltd., Slovakian Door Company, s.r.o., Antolin Austria Holding, GmbH and Antolin Ebergassing,
GmbH, together with the dissolution and liquidation of Chongqing Zhenneng Antolin Auto Parts, Co., Ltd.,
Antolin incurred a net loss of 5,065 thousand euros, which is recognised under “Gains or losses on the loss
of control of consolidated equity interests” of the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2023.

Also, the effect of the addition of companies in the Group’s scope of consolidation in 2023 on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group taken as a whole was scantly material.

2022:

The changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in 2022 were as follows:

 - In March 2022, Antolin sold all of its 61% holding in the Chinese joint ventures Chongqing Antolin Tuopu
Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and Harbin Antolin
Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., to their current shareholder, Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd.

 - In March 2022 Antolin sold 100% of its ownership interest in the US subsidiary Antolin Spartanburg
Assembly, Inc. to the Motus Integrated Technologies Group.


-----

     - In the second half of 2022 Antolin incorporated the Indian company Grupo Antolin Design and Business
Services Private Limited, whose main object is to provide engineering and CAD services, as well as the
North American companies Antolin Nashville, LLC and Antolin Insurance Company, LLC, in which the
Group has a 100% interest in its share capital.

     - In July 2022 the Group acquired an additional 51% stake in the share capital of Wuhan Antolin Auto
Parts, Co. Ltd, in which it had previously held 49%, for a price of practically zero. As a result of this
transaction, the Group now has a 100% shareholding in said company and exercises control over it.
Accordingly, this company, over which the Group exercised significant influence, has changed from an
associate to a subsidiary and, in consequence, is now “fully consolidated”.

     - The dissolution and liquidation of the subsidiary Gestión Industrial de Sonora, S.A. de C.V., which was
inactive.

Also in 2022 the Group acquired the shareholding held by non-controlling interests in the subsidiary Wuhan
Antolin Automotive Interiors Co., Ltd., over which the Group exercised control, for an amount of 1,379
thousand euros. As a result of this transaction, the Group's holding in this company increased from 51% to
100%. This transaction has not resulted in any changes to the scope of consolidation.

The income and expenses and gains and losses derived from the companies disposed of during the period
between the start of 2022 and the date on which these companies were disposed of or dissolved were of
scant significance, and the net changes in their assets and liabilities over the same period were also
immaterial.

As a result of the sale of these companies, as well as the dissolution and liquidation of Gestión Industrial de
Sonora, S.A. de C.V., the Group incurred a net loss of 324 thousand euros, which is recognised under “Gains
or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests” in the accompanying consolidated income
statement for 2022.

The effect of the additions of companies to the scope of consolidation in 2022 on the Group’s consolidated
financial statements has not been significant.

**(3)** **ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND**
**MEASUREMENT CRITERIA**

In preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2023 the following accounting principles and policies and
measurement criteria were applied:

**a) Goodwill-**

“Goodwill” is only recorded when it has been acquired for a consideration and represents, therefore, advance
payments made by the acquiring entity for the future economic benefits deriving from the assets of the
acquired entity that are not individually and separately identifiable and recognisable.

Impairment losses
In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment (i.e., a reduction in the
recoverable amount of the “Goodwill” to below its book value) at the end of each reporting period and if
there is any impairment, the goodwill is written down with a charge to “Net impairment losses on noncurrent assets” in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses relating to “Goodwill” cannot
subsequently be reversed.


-----

The recoverable value of goodwill and of other intangible and tangible assets is measured as the higher of
fair value less costs to sell and value in use, understood to be the present value of expected future cash
flows from the investment. The Group's Directors apply the following methodology to test goodwill, other
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment (see Notes 7 and 8):

  - The recoverable amounts are calculated for each cash generating unit (CGU). The goodwill acquired in
a business combination is assigned to each one of the cash generating units or groups of cash generating
units that are expected to benefit from the combination synergies. Each unit or group of units to which
goodwill is assigned represents the lowest level in the entity at which goodwill is controlled for internal
management purposes (see Note 7). For the purpose of intangible and tangible fixed assets, cash
generating units are associated with the projects.

  - The Group's Directors regularly prepare a business plan for each cash generating unit, broken down by
market and activity, covering a period of at least five years. An annual budget is also prepared each year
for the following financial year. The main components of said plan and budget are:

       - Results forecasts.

       - Investment and working capital forecasts.

  - Other variables influencing the calculation of recoverable value are:

       - The discount rate to be applied, i.e., the weighted average cost of capital. The main factors
affecting this are the cost of the liabilities and specific risks related to the assets.

       - The growth rate applied to cash flows to extrapolate them beyond the period covered by
budgets and forecasts, up to five financial years.

Forecasts are prepared on the basis of past experience and the best available estimates in line with externally
obtained information.

The business plans thus prepared are reviewed and approved by the Parent's Board of Directors.

If an impairment loss must be recognised for a cash generating unit to which all or part of the goodwill has
been assigned, first the book value of the goodwill corresponding to the cash generating unit will be reduced.
If the impairment loss exceeds the amount of goodwill, the rest of assets allocated to the CGU are then
written down, in proportion to their book values, up to the limit of the higher of the following: fair value
less cost to sell, value in use and zero.

At 2023 and 2022 year-end no goodwill impairment was recorded.

“Goodwill” recognised in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December
2023 corresponds basically to the consolidated subsidiaries and plants acquired in 2015 from the
international Magna Automotive group and other companies forming part of the “Lighting” business acquired
from the “CML Innovative Technologies” group in 2012, and other non-material goodwill recognised (see
Note 7).

**b) Other intangible assets-**

Intangible assets are stated initially at acquisition or production cost and subsequently at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.


-----

Development expenditure 
The costs incurred in each development project are capitalised when the following conditions are met:

      - The development cost of the asset can be assessed reliably.

      - The costs are specifically itemised for each project and correspond to an identifiable asset.

      - The Group can prove that the project is technically viable.

      - The project is likely to generate profits in the future.

Development expenditure incurred using the Group's own resources are recorded (by type) in the
consolidated income statement, while development expenditure for projects which meet the above
conditions are debited against “Development expenditure” in the consolidated statement of financial position
and credited to “Own work capitalised” in the consolidated income statement.

Capitalised development expenditure are in practically all cases amortised on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the projects as from the date the related projects are completed.

Development expenditure relate mainly to the costs incurred in this connection by the consolidated
subsidiary Grupo Antolin-Ingeniería, S.A.U. and the Group's other research and development centres.
Research expenses are taken directly to income in the financial year in which they are incurred.

Software and other intangible assets
Other intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised accordingly, using criteria similar to those used
to depreciate property, plant and equipment. Specifically, “Computer software” is written off over a period
of 5 years as from when it starts to be used.

When accounting for the business combination involving the companies and plants acquired in 2015 from the
international Magna Automotive group, “Customer relations” in the automobile industry was identified as an
intangible asset, on the basis that one of the Group's aims in carrying out said operation was to develop new
services and products in this sector. This intangible asset has been measured at its fair value. The remaining
useful life of this intangible asset was estimated between 2 and 7 years, over which period it will be amortised.

The annual amortisation charge for intangible assets with finite useful lives is charged to “Depreciation and
amortisation charge” in the consolidated income statement.

Impairment losses
The consolidated companies recognise any impairment loss in the book value of the assets associated with
the CGUs with a charge to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income
statement. The criteria used to recognise the impairment losses on these assets associated with the CGUs
and, where applicable, the recovery of impairment losses recorded in prior years, are similar to those applied
for property, plant and equipment for own use.

**c)** **Property, plant and equipment-**

Property, plant and equipment include the assets that the Group has for its current or future use in producing
or supplying goods and services or for administrative purposes and which are expected to be used for more
than one financial year. Property, plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement of financial
position at their acquisition or production cost, adjusted or revalued, whenever applicable, in accordance
with applicable legal provisions, or at their “fair value” as determined by independent experts on the date of
transition to IFRS-EU (1 January 2006) or the date of the business combination, the amount of which is
recorded as an attributed cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.


-----

The cost of extensions, modernisations or improvements that increase the productivity, capacity or efficiency
or prolong the useful life of an asset are capitalised as an increase in the cost of said asset.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to building or developing property, plant and equipment that
necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of
those assets, until such time as the assets are ready to become operational. In cases where financing has been
received specifically for building said assets, the amount of the interest and other finance costs capitalised
reflects the actual costs incurred during the period, less income earned from temporarily reinvesting the
financing that has not yet been invested in the qualifying assets. Where the financing received is of a general
nature, the amount of interest capitalised is calculated using a rate based on the weighted average of the
interest costs applicable to the average unrepaid financing in the year excluding financing for specific purposes.
However, the capitalisation of interest is suspended during the periods in which the construction work is at
a standstill, provided that such periods are not particularly long. In 2023 and 2022, the Group had not
capitalised any finance costs as an increase in the book value of “Property, plant and equipment”.

Upkeep and maintenance expenses for property, plant and equipment for own use are expensed in the year
they are incurred.

The Group transfers PP&E under construction to PP&E used in operations when the assets in question
become operational, from which time depreciation is charged.

Property, plant and equipment used in operations are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on the
acquisition or production cost of the assets or their restated value, less their residual value. The land on
which buildings and other constructions are located is deemed to have an indefinite lifespan and is therefore
not subject to depreciation. Annual depreciation charges on property, plant and equipment are charged to
“Depreciation and amortisation charges” in the consolidated income statement over the average estimated
useful life of the assets, as indicated below:

Years of
Estimated

Type of Asset Useful Life

**Buildings and other structures** 20-50
**Plant and machinery-**
Machinery 5-12.5
Plant 6-25
**Other plant, tools and furniture-**
Tools, dies and moulds 2-6
Office furniture and equipment 5-10
**Other property, plant and equipment-**
Vehicles 5-10
Information technology equipment 4-5

Reviews are made at regular intervals of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment for own
use in order to identify any significant changes therein. If any such changes are identified, the relevant
adjustment is made to the depreciation charged to the consolidated income statements in future years based
on the new useful lives.

At the end of each reporting period, the consolidated companies test for any internal or external signs that
the recoverable amount of their property, plant and equipment associated with the cash generating units is
less than the book value. If so, the book value is reduced to the recoverable value and the future charges for
depreciation are adjusted in proportion to their adjusted book value and their new remaining useful life if it
was also necessary to re-estimate this. Any such reduction in the book value of property, plant and equipment
for own use associated with the cash generating units is charged to “Net impairment losses on non-current
assets” in the consolidated income statement.

|Type of Asset|Years of Estimated Useful Life|
|---|---|
|Buildings and other structures Plant and machinery- Machinery Plant Other plant, tools and furniture- Tools, dies and moulds Office furniture and equipment Other property, plant and equipment- Vehicles Information technology equipment|20-50 5-12.5 6-25 2-6 5-10 5-10 4-5|


-----

Similarly, whenever there are signs that the value of an impaired tangible asset has recovered, the
consolidated companies reverse the impairment loss recognised in prior years, with a credit to “Net
impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement, and adjust future
depreciation charges accordingly. The increased book value may not exceed the book value that would have
been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset.

**d) Investment property-**

Investment property comprises land, buildings or other constructions held to earn rents or for capital
appreciation upon disposal due to future increases in their respective market prices.

The same methods of valuation, depreciation, and for estimating their respective useful lives and recording
any impairment losses are used as for property, plant and equipment for own use.

**e) Accounting for leasing operations-**

As lessor
Whenever the Group acts as lessor, the cost of acquiring the assets leased is stated in “Investment property”
or “Property, plant and equipment”. Depreciation is charged on these assets in accordance with the policies
adopted for similar PP&E items for own use, and the revenues from the lease contracts are released to the
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis.

As lessee
In agreements that contain one or more lease and non-lease components, the Group assigns the
consideration to each lease component in accordance with the separate sale price of the lease component
and the individual aggregate price of the various lease components.

Payments made by the Group that do not entail the transfer of goods or services to it by the lessor do not
constitute a separate lease component, and instead form part of the total lease consideration.

At the start of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset
comprises the amount of the lease liability, any lease payment made on or prior to the starting date, less any
incentives received, any direct start-up costs incurred and an estimate of the decommissioning or restoration
costs to be incurred, as indicated in the provision accounting policy.

The Group measures the lease liability as the present value of outstanding lease payments on the starting
date. The Group discounts lease payments at the appropriate incremental interest rate, unless the lessor's
implicit interest rate can be reliably determined.

Outstanding lease payments are composed of fixed payments, less any incentive receivable, variable payments
dependent on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate applicable on the inception date,
amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, the price for the purchase option whose
exercise is reasonably expected and the payments of compensation for lease cancellation, provided that the
term of the lease reflects the exercise of the cancellation option.

The Group measures right-of-use assets at cost, less any depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,
adjusted by any re-calculation of the lease liability.

If the agreement transfers ownership of the asset to the Group at the end of the lease or the right-of-use
asset includes the purchase option price, the depreciation method indicated in the property, plant and
equipment section from the inception date of the lease to the end of the useful life of the asset is applied.
Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the starting date to the earlier date between
the useful life of the right or the end of the lease term.


-----

The Group applies non-current asset impairment loss criteria to the right-of-use asset, in accordance with
the contents of Notes 3-a, 3-b and 3-c.

The Group measures lease liability by increasing it by the accrued financial expense, decreasing it by payments
made and re-calculating the book value for lease modifications or to reflect updates of in-substance fixed
payments.

The Group records variable payments not included in the initial measurement of profit or loss for the period
in which the events that trigger its payment take place.

The Group records liability re-calculations as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset until this is reduced to
zero and subsequently in profit or loss.

The Group reassesses the lease liability by discounting lease payments at an updated rate, if a change in the
term of the lease or a change in the expectations of exercising the purchase option for the underlying asset
take place.

The Group reassesses the lease liability if a change takes place in the amounts expected to be paid under
residual value guarantees or in the index or rate used to determine the payments, including a change to
reflect changes in market rents once a revision takes place.

The Group recognises a lease modification as a separate lease if this increases the scope of the lease by
adding one or more usage rights and the amount of the consideration for the lease increases by an amount
consistent with the individual price for the increase in scope, and any adjustment to the individual price to
reflect the specific circumstances of the contract.

If the modification does not result in a separate lease on the modification date, the Group assigns the
consideration to the modified lease as indicated above, re-determines the lease term and reassesses the value
of the liability less the revised payments at the revised interest rate. The Group decreases the book value of
the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or total conclusion of the lease, in those modifications that
decrease the scope of the lease and records it in profit or loss. For all other modifications the Group adjusts
the book value of the right-of-use asset.

i) Short-term leases and leases where the asset is of low value
The Group applies the exemptions for recognising short-term leases (those leases with terms of 12
months or less from the inception date and that do not include a purchase option) and leases in which
the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments deriving from these contracts are expensed on
a straight-line basis over the lease term under “Other operating expenses” in the consolidated income
statement.

ii) Establishing the lease terms of contracts with options to extend
The Group establishes the lease term as the irrevocable period of a lease plus: (i) any periods covered
by an option to extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise this option; and
(ii) any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it
will not exercise this option.

When evaluating if it is reasonably likely the option to extend a lease will be exercised or the option
to terminate a lease will not be exercised, the Group takes into account any relevant events and
circumstances prompting the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease or not exercise the
option to terminate the lease.

After the inception date, the Group will re-evaluate the lease term whenever there is a significant event
or change in the circumstances under the Group's control which affects whether or not there is
reasonable certainty the options will or will not be exercised.

**f)** **Non-current assets held for sale-**

Assets which are highly likely to be sold, in their present condition, within one year from the end of the
reporting period are recorded under this heading in the consolidated financial statements. The book value
of these assets is, therefore, expected to be recovered via their selling price rather than from their ongoing
use. Assets classified as “Non-current assets held for sale” are stated at the lower of their book value when
they are classified as such and their fair value net of their estimated cost to sell. Amortisable intangible assets
and depreciable PP&E are not amortised or depreciated while classified as held for sale.

In 2023 and 2022 the Group held land in Tangiers (Morocco) acquired in 2014, which is classified under
“Non-current assets held for sale”. Based on assessments made by an independent expert and offers recently
received, the fair value of this building is at least equal to its book value. It is expected to be sold over the
next twelve months.

Also, at 2022 year-end, the assets of the Russian subsidiaries were classified under “Non-current assets
classified as held for sale” in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The
aforementioned subsidiaries make up the “Russia” geographical segment, which at that date was in the process
of being sold and was ultimately sold in March 2023. The liabilities of these subsidiaries were also recognised
in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 under “Liabilities
associated with non-current assets classified as held for sale” (see Notes 3-q, 6 and 25).

**g) Inventories-**

The Group values its inventories as follows:

   - Raw materials and other supplies, packaging and containers, replacement parts, sundry materials, add-on
parts and stocks for resale are valued at the lower of cost, applying the weighted average price method,
and net realisable value.

   - Finished goods, semi-finished goods and work-in-process are stated at the lower of real average
production cost (raw and other materials used, labour and direct and indirect manufacturing expenses)
or net realisable value.

   - Tools for new projects, which are developed and manufactured by the Group to be sold later on to its
customers, are stated at the lower of either the costs incurred to manufacture them, as and when they
are incurred, or their estimated realisable value.

Net realisable value corresponds to the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completing the
products and the costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Obsolete, defective or slow-moving inventories have been reduced to their realisable value. The Group
recognises the appropriate valuation adjustments as an expense in the consolidated income statement for the
year when the net realisable value of the inventory is lower than its acquisition or production cost.


-----

**h) Financial instruments-**

Recognition and classification of financial instruments
Financial instruments are classified at initial recognition as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity
instruments, in accordance with the underlying economic value of the agreement and with the definitions of
financial asset, financial liability or equity instrument provided in IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation”.

Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party bound to a contract or legal
transaction in accordance with its provisions.

For valuation purposes, the Group classifies financial instruments in categories of financial assets and
liabilities at fair value with changes in profit or loss, separating those initially designated from those held for
trading or obligatorily measured at fair value with changes in profit or loss, financial assets and liabilities
measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive
income, separating equity instruments designated as such from the rest of the financial assets. The Group
classifies financial assets, other than those designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss and equity
instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, in accordance with the
business model and the characteristics of contractual cash flows. The Group classifies financial liabilities as
measured at amortised cost, except those designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss and those
held for trading.

The Group classifies a financial asset or liability as held for trading if:

  - It is acquired or incurred mainly to sell or repurchase it in the immediate future;

  - During initial recognition it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that are jointly
managed and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking;

  - It is a derivative, except a derivative designated as a hedging instrument and complies with conditions for
effectiveness, and a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract; or

  - It is an obligation to deliver financial assets borrowed but not yet owned.

The Group classifies a financial asset at amortised cost, if it is maintained within the scope of a business model
whose objective is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows and the contractual conditions of the
financial asset generate, on specified dates, cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on
the amount of outstanding principle.

The Group classifies a financial asset at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income if it is
maintained within the scope of a business model whose objective is attained by obtaining contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual conditions of the financial asset generate, on specified
dates, cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest.

The business model is determined by core Group personnel and at a level that reflects the way in which
groups of financial assets are jointly managed to attain a specific business objective. The Group's business
model represents the way in which it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows.

Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows
are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections throughout the instrument's life. The Group
manages the assets held in the portfolio to collect the specific contractual cash flows. To determine whether
the cash flows are obtained through the collection of contractual cash flows from the financial assets, the
Group considers the frequency, value and sale calendar in prior years, the reasons for those sales and
expectations with regard to future sales activity. Nevertheless, the sales themselves do not determine the
business model and, therefore, may not be considered on their own. Instead, it is the information on past
sales and future sale expectations that provides indicative data on the means of attaining the Group's stated


-----

purpose with respect to the management of financial assets and, more specifically, the way in which cash
flows are obtained. The Group considers the information on past sales within the context of the reasons for
these sales and of the conditions that existed at that time in comparison with current ones. For these
purposes, the Group considers that trade and other receivables that will be transferred to third parties and
do not involve derecognition are maintained in this business model.

While the purpose of the Group's business model is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows, the
Group does not hold all instruments to maturity. Thus, the Group's business model is to hold financial assets
to receive contractual cash flows even if sales of those assets have taken place or are expected to take place
in the future. The Group understands that it complies with this requirement, provided that the sales are due
to an increase in the credit risk of the financial assets. In all other cases, at the individual and aggregate level,
sales must be of minor significance, whether they are frequent or infrequent, even if they may be significant.

Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows
and sell them, are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections and to sell them according to the
Group's varying needs. In this type of business model and in order to comply with this objective, the Group's
core management personnel have decided that the attainment of contractual cash flows and the sale of
financial assets are essential. To achieve this objective, the Group obtains contractual cash flows and sells
financial assets. Compared to the previous business model, in this business model the Group regularly makes
asset sales more frequently and of greater value.

The contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only are consistent with a basic loan
agreement. In a basic loan agreement, the most significant elements of interest are generally the consideration
for the time value of money and the credit risk. Nevertheless, in an agreement of this type, the interest also
includes the consideration for other risks, such as the risk of liquidity and costs, like the administrative costs
of a basic loan associated with holding the financial asset for a given period. Furthermore, the interest may
include a profit mark-up that may be consistent with a basic loan agreement.

The Group designates a financial asset initially at fair value with changes in profit or loss) if, by doing so, it
eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition of its profit or loss
that would otherwise arise if the measurement of the assets or liabilities or recognition of the profit or loss
is made on different bases.

All other financial assets are classified at fair value with changes in profit or loss.

Financial assets and liabilities arising from contingent consideration in a business combination are classified
as financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit or loss.

The Group initially designates a financial liability at fair value with changes in profit or loss if, by doing so, it
eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition of its profit or loss
that would otherwise arise if the measurement of the assets or liability or the recognition of the profit or
loss is made on different bases or a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and liabilities is managed,
and its return is evaluated, based on fair value, in accordance with an investment or documented risk
management strategy, and information is furnished internally to the Group's core management personnel
about that group on that same basis.

The Group classifies all other financial liabilities, except financial guarantee contracts, loan commitments
below market interest rate and financial liabilities resulting from a transfer of financial assets that do not
qualify for derecognition or are recorded using the continuing involvement approach, as financial liabilities
at amortised cost.


-----

Offset principles
Financial assets and financial liabilities may only be offset when the Group currently has the legal right to
offset recognised amounts and intends to either settle by offset or to realise the assets and settle the
liabilities simultaneously. For the Group to have the currently legal right, it may not be contingent on a
future event and should be legally required in the ordinary course of operations, in the event of insolvency
or legally declared liquidation and in the event of non-payment.

Financial assets measured at cost
Investments in equity instruments for which there is insufficient information for measurement or in which a
broad range of measurements exist and the related derivatives have to be settled by the delivery of those
investments, are measured at cost. However, if the Group may at any time have a reliable measurement of
the asset or the contract, these will be recognised at fair value at that time, recording the profits or losses
in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, if the instrument is designated at fair value with changes in
other comprehensive income.

Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost
Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost are initially recognised at their fair value, plus or minus any
transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest
method.

Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit or Ioss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase or issue are recognised as an expense when they are
incurred.

Initially, the fair value of a financial instrument is normally the transaction price, unless that price contains
several instrument elements, in which case the Group determines its fair value. If the Group determines that
an instrument's fair value differs from the transaction price, it records the difference in profit or loss, to the
extent that the value is obtained by reference to a price of an identical asset or liability quoted on an active
market, or was obtained by a valuation technique that only uses observable data. In all other cases, the
Group recognises the difference in profit or loss, to the extent that it derives from a change in a factor that
market participants would consider when determining the price of the asset or liability.

Subsequent to its initial recognition, it is recognised at fair value with changes in profit or loss. Changes in
fair value include the interest component and dividends. Fair value does not decrease due to the transaction
costs that may be incurred through its eventual sale or disposal by any other means.

Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss, the
Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income.
Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income
statement.

The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the
internal rate of return at the start of the period using the fair value and contractual cash flows and deducting
the reference interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, provided
that the change in reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could
entail significant changes to fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the
rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk
component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change
linked to the credit risk.


-----

Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss, the
Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income.
Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income
statement.

The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the
internal rate of return at the start of the period using fair value and contractual cash flows, and deducts the
reference interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, provided
that the change in the reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could
entail significant changes in the fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at
the rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk
component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change
linked to the credit risk.

Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income
Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair
value plus any transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase.

Following initial recognition, the financial assets classified in this category are measured at fair value,
recognising profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the exception of profit and loss by exchange
rate, as set out in the section on foreign currency transactions, and expected credit losses. The amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss as soon as financial asset
derecognition takes place. However, the interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised
in profit or loss.

As indicated above, the Group has designated certain equity instruments as measured at fair value with
changes in other comprehensive income. Following initial recognition, the equity instruments are measured
at fair value, recognising the profit or loss in other comprehensive income. The amounts recognised in other
comprehensive income are not re-classified to profit or loss, without prejudice to their re-classification to
reserves at the moment of instrument derecognition.

Fair value of financial instruments
The “fair value” of a financial instrument on a particular date is defined as the amount at which it could be
bought or sold on that date between knowledgeable parties in an arm's length transaction. The most
objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid
for it on an organised, transparent and deep market (“quoted price” or “market price”).

When there is no market price for a specific financial instrument, its fair value is estimated on the basis of
recent transactions involving similar instruments and, if there are none, using measurement models that have
been sufficiently verified by the international financial community, bearing in mind the specific nature of the
instrument to be valued and, in particular, the different types of risk associated with it.

For financial reporting purposes, measurements of fair value are classified under three levels according to
the extent to which the inputs applied are observable and according to how significant said inputs are for the
entire measurement, as described below:

- Level 1: inputs are based on quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2: inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities (not included
in Level 1), quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and
techniques based on measurement models for which all the significant inputs are derived from or may
be corroborated by observable market data.


-----

- Level 3: inputs are generally unobservable and, in general, reflect estimates based on market assumptions
to determine the price of the asset or liability. Unobservable data used in measurement models are a
significant part of the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

Impairment losses
Since 1 January 2018, financial assets valued at amortised cost, trade receivables and other loans, in addition
to financial guarantee contracts, have been subject to the recording of an impairment loss based on the
expected loss of credit, either at 12 months (assets classified as investments available for sale) or over the
whole lifetime (trade debtor accounts). In order to calculate the impairment loss based on the expected
loss, the Group has established a model which requires estimates of future credit losses using a simplified
approach. Given the nature, conditions and high credit quality of its accounts receivable and loans, the amount
of impairment losses required as a result of the application of the new model to the financial asset balances
is usually of little significance.

Financial instrument derecognition, modifications or cancellations
The Group applies financial asset derecognition criteria to part of a financial asset or a group of similar
financial assets, or all of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them are terminated or
transferred, and the Group substantially transfers the risks and benefits deriving from their ownership.
Furthermore, the derecognition of financial assets in those circumstances in which the Group retains the
contractual rights to receive cash flows only occurs when contractual obligations that determine the payment
of those flows to one or more recipients have been assumed, and the following requirements are fulfilled:

- Payment of cash flows is conditioned on its prior collection;

- The Group may not proceed to sell or pledge the financial asset; and

- Cash flows collected on behalf of the eventual recipients are sent with significant delay, and the Group
is not entitled to reinvest the cash flows. The application of this criterion does not include investments
in cash or cash equivalents made by the Group during the settlement period between the collection
date and delivery date stipulated with the eventual recipients, provided that any interest accrued is
attributed to the eventual recipients.

In those cases in which the Group transfers a financial asset in its entirety but retains the administration rights
to them in exchange for a fee, an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with the rendering of that
service. If the consideration received is less than the expenses to be incurred as a result of rendering the
service, a liability is recognised for an amount equivalent to the obligations assumed measured at fair value.
If the consideration for the service is greater than what would result from applying adequate remuneration,
an asset is recognised for the administration rights.

In transactions in which the total derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the financial assets obtained
or the financial liabilities, including the liabilities corresponding to administration services incurred, are
recorded at fair value.

In transactions in which the partial derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the book value of the
complete financial asset is assigned to the part sold and to the part retained, including any assets
corresponding to administration services, in proportion to the relative fair value of each of them.

The total derecognition of a financial asset entails the recognition of profit or loss for the difference between
its book value and the sum of the consideration received, net of transaction expenses, including any assets
obtained or liabilities assumed and any deferred profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the
exception of equity instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income.


-----

The criteria for the derecognition of financial assets in transactions in which the Group neither transfers nor
substantially maintains the risks and benefits inherent to ownership are based on the analysis of the degree
of control maintained. In this way:

- If the Group has not retained control, the financial asset is derecognised and any rights or obligations
created or retained as a result of the transfer are recognised separately as assets or liabilities.

- If control has been retained, the financial asset will continue to be recognised due to the Group's
continued commitment in it and an associated liability is recorded. The continued commitment in the
financial asset is determined by the amount of its exposure to changes in value of that asset. The asset
and associated liability are measured on the basis of the rights and obligations recognised by the Group.
The associated liability is recognised so that the book value of the asset and the associated liability is
equal to the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by the Group, when the asset is
measured at amortised cost, or at the fair value of the rights and obligations maintained by the Group if
the asset is measured at fair value. The Group continues to recognise revenue deriving from the asset to
the extent of its continued commitment and expenses deriving from the associated liability. Changes in
the fair value of the asset and associated liability are consistently recognised in profit or loss or in equity,
in accordance with the general recognition criteria set out above, and should not be offset.

The transactions in which the Group retains substantially all the risks and benefits inherent to the ownership
of a transferred financial asset are recorded through the recognition of the consideration received in liability
accounts. Transaction expenses are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.

The Group applies weighted average price criteria to measure and derecognise the cost of equity instruments
that form part of homogeneous portfolios and that have the same rights, unless the instruments sold and
their individual cost may be clearly identified. For debt instruments, it determines the cost at the individual
or group level in accordance with the unit of account used to determine impairment.

If the Group modifies the contractual cash flows of a financial asset, insofar as this does not entail its
derecognition, the book value is re-calculated by the present value of the flows modified at the effective
interest rate or effective interest rate adjusted by the original credit risk, and recognises the difference in
profit or loss. The costs and fees invoiced by the Group adjust the book value of the financial asset and
depreciates them during the remaining life of the modified financial asset.

At 31 December 2023, the outstanding receivables transferred without recourse to financial institutions and
pending maturity at that date amounted to 193,236 thousand euros (122,605 thousand euros at 31 December
2022).

Interest and dividends
The Group recognises interest by the effective interest method, which is the update rate that makes a financial
instrument's book value equal to the estimated cash flows throughout the instrument's expected life, based
on its contractual conditions and without considering expected credit losses, except for financial assets
acquired or arising from incurred losses.

The interest recognised on the gross book value of the financial assets, except for financial assets acquired
or arising from incurred credit losses and financial assets with impaired credit. For the former, the Group
recognises interest by the effective interest rate adjusted by the initial credit risk, and for the latter, the
Group recognises the interest on the amortised cost.

Changes in cash flow estimates are deducted at the effective interest rate or the interest rate adjusted by the
original credit risk and are recognised in profit or loss.


-----

Revenue for dividends from investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when rights
arise for the Group upon collecting them, financial profit collection is probable, and the amount may be
reliably estimated.

Dividends from equity instruments classified at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are
recognised in profit or loss, unless they represent a return on the investment, in which case they are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

The Group recognises default interest in commercial transactions as financial income and expenses in
accordance with the legal and contractual conditions stipulated. If that interest is ultimately offset or
condoned, the Group recognises the transaction in accordance with its substance. The Group recognises the
legal right to offset collection management costs incurred when collection is probable. The Group
recognises the expense for the claim of collection management costs as indicated in the provision accounting
policy.

Financial liability derecognition and modification
The Group derecognises a financial liability or a part thereof following compliance with the obligation
contained in the financial liability contract or when it is legally released from main responsibility for the
liability, either by judicial process or by the creditor.

The exchange of debt instruments between the Group and the counterparty or substantial modifications to
initially recognised liabilities are recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability and the
recognition of a new financial liability, provided that the instruments have substantially different conditions.

The Group considers the conditions to be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows
deducted under the new conditions, including any fees paid net of any fees received, and using the original
effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by at least 10% from the discounted present value of the
remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.

If the exchange is recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability, the costs or fees are recognised
in profit or loss, forming part of the gain or loss on the cancellation. Otherwise, the modified cash flows are
deducted at the original effective interest rate, recognising any difference with respect to the prior book value
in profit or loss. Furthermore, the costs or fees adjust the book value of the financial liability and are
amortised using the amortised cost method over the remaining life of the modified liability.

The Group recognises the difference between the book value of the financial liability or part thereof that is
cancelled or transferred to a third party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred
or liabilities assumed in profit or loss.

**i)** **Balances and transactions denominated in foreign currencies-**

The Group uses the euro as its presentation currency. Consequently, transactions in other currencies are
considered to be denominated in foreign currency and are recorded according to the exchange rates
prevailing on the transaction date. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies are
taken to the consolidated income statement as and when they occur.

At the year-end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euros at
the rate prevailing at the date of the consolidated statement of financial position. Any resulting gains or losses
are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.


-----

**j)** **Provisions and contingencies-**

Provisions are current obligations of the Group arising as a result of past events the nature of which is clearly
specified at the date of the consolidated financial statements, but whose amount and/or reversal date are
uncertain and the settlement of which will probably result in an outflow from the Group of resources
embodying economic benefits.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group arising as a result of past events which depend
on whether or not one or more events beyond the Group's control occur in the future. They include the
Group's current obligations whose settlement will probably not require an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits, or where a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be
quantified.

Significant provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position wherever it is
considered more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, but rather, where
applicable, are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Provisions are measured using the best information available of the expenditures required to settle the
obligation and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the current best
estimate. They are used to meet the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised and are
fully or partially reversed when those obligations cease to exist or are reduced.

The value of these provisions corresponds to the current value of the best estimate possible of the amount
necessary to cancel or transfer the obligation, recording the adjustments made from updating said provisions
as financial costs as they accrue. Specifically, the liabilities recorded under “Current provisions” in the
accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 correspond to provisions
made to cover losses which certain subsidiaries are expected to incur to comply with contracts signed prior
to the end of the reporting period and whose costs will exceed the expected returns generated. The
provision is made when the liabilities in respect of the contracts arise for the affected companies (see Note
16).

The provisions deemed necessary in accordance with these criteria, and the reversals thereof, are recorded
as a charge or credit, respectively, to the consolidated income statement.

**k) Termination benefits-**

Under current employment legislation, the consolidated companies are obliged to pay termination benefits
to employees whose contracts are terminated under certain conditions.

Where the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated, such benefits are recognised as an expense
in the year in which the decision is made, provided the parties involved have been formally notified and there
is, therefore, a valid expectation on the part of those involved that the consolidated companies will make
the dismissals. The accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 includes
several provisions for this concept.

**l)** **Pension commitments-**

Some Antolin companies have assumed various commitments to pay contributions to the retirement pensions
of some of their current and former employees (retirement plans based on years of service, age and salary).
These commitments affect, primarily, group companies located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France,
Mexico and India.


-----

A significant portion of these commitments has been outsourced and are covered by insurance policies or
pension plans with insurance companies. The Group pays fixed contributions into a fund and is obliged to
make additional contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all the employees the benefits
to which it is committed.

The Group records the present value of these defined benefit commitments as liabilities in the consolidated
statement of financial position under “Non-current provisions”, net of the fair value of the assets that meet
the requirements to be treated as “assets earmarked for the plan”. The aforementioned insurance policies
(or pension plans) are treated as earmarked assets as they are not owned by the Group but by an unrelated
third party, may only be used to pay or finance employee benefits and may not be returned to the Group
unless the assets held within the plan are sufficient to meet all obligations.

Changes in the provision recognised for these commitments in the consolidated statement of financial
position corresponding to the cost of the services during the current period or to interest, are taken to the
consolidated income statement in the financial year in which they occur, to the extent that “actuarial gains
and losses” (that result from differences existing between previous actuarial assumptions and real outcomes
and changes to the actuarial assumptions used) are taken directly to equity as “Valuation adjustments”.

**m) Corporate income tax-**

Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and practically all of its consolidated Spanish subsidiaries domiciled in Spanish
“common territory” in which it has direct or indirect holdings of 75% or more file consolidated corporate
income tax returns. Until 31 December 2014, the parent of the consolidated tax group was Grupo AntolinIrausa, S.A.U. Since 1 January 2015, the parent of the consolidated tax group under which these companies
file has been Avot Inversiones, S.L., the Group's indirect shareholder (see Notes 1, 13 and 19).

The income tax expense is calculated as the tax payable with respect to the taxable profit for the year, after
considering any changes in the year in the assets and liabilities recognised arising from temporary differences
and from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards (see Note 19).

The Group considers that a temporary difference exists when there is a difference between the book value
of an asset or liability and its tax base. The tax base for assets and liabilities is treated as the amount attributed
to it for tax purposes. A taxable temporary difference is understood to be a difference that will generate a
future obligation for the Group to pay taxes to the relevant tax authorities. A deductible temporary
difference is one that will generate a right for the Group to a refund or to make a lower payment to the
relevant tax authorities in the future.

Tax credits and deductions and tax loss carryforwards are amounts that, after the performance of the activity
or generation of the profit or loss giving entitlement to them, are not used for tax purposes in the related
tax return until the conditions for doing so established in tax regulations are met, provided that the Group
considers it probable that they will be used in future periods.

Current tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the
related tax authorities within twelve months from the date they are recognised. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are those amounts that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the relevant tax
authorities in future years.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. In this regard, a deferred tax
liability is recognised for the taxable temporary differences resulting from investments in subsidiaries and
associate companies, and from holdings in joint ventures, except when the Group can control the reversal
of the temporary differences and they are not expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future.

The consolidated companies only recognise deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences
and from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that they will have sufficient
future taxable profits against which these assets can be utilised.


-----

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or
liability (other than in a business combination) that at the time of recognition affects neither accounting profit
nor taxable profit.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are reassessed at each reporting date in order to ascertain
whether they still exist, and the appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses
performed.

Tax uncertainties
If the Group determines that it is not likely that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment or a
group of uncertain tax treatments, it considers that uncertainty in determining taxable income, tax base, tax
loss carryforwards, deductions or tax rates. The Group determines the effect of the uncertainty in the
corporate income tax return using the expected value method, when the range of possible outcomes is highly
disperse, or the most probable outcome method, when the outcome is binary or concentrated in one amount.
In those cases in which the tax asset or liability calculated with these criteria exceeds the self-assessed
amount, it is presented as current or non-current in the consolidated statement of financial position according
to the expected recovery or settlement date and considering, where appropriate, the amount of any
corresponding default interest on the liability as it accrues in the consolidated income statement. The Group
records changes in events and circumstances regarding tax uncertainties as a change in estimate.

The Group recognises and presents penalties in accordance with the accounting policy for provisions.

Offset and classification
The Group only offsets current income tax assets and liabilities if a legal right exists vis-à-vis the tax
authorities and it intends to settle any resulting debts at their net amount, or realise the assets and settle
the debts simultaneously.

The Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if a legal offset right exists vis-à-vis the tax
authorities and these assets and liabilities correspond to the same tax authority, and to the same taxpayer or
to different taxpayers that seek to settle or realise the current tax assets and liabilities at their net amount
or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each one of the future tax periods in which
they expect to settle or recover significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as noncurrent assets or liabilities, regardless of the anticipated date of realisation or settlement.

**n) Recognition of income and expense-**

i) Recognition of revenue from customer contracts

Revenue from customer contracts is recognised based on fulfilment of the performance obligations with
those customers.

Ordinary revenue represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to have a right in exchange for those goods and
services.

Five steps are established for the recognition of revenue:

─ Identify the customer contract/s.

─ Identify the performance obligations.


-----

─ Determine the transaction price.

─ Assign the transaction price to the various performance obligations.

─ Recognise the revenue according to fulfilment of each obligation.

On the basis of this recognition model, sales of goods are recognised when the products are delivered to
the customer and the customer accepts them, even if they have not yet been invoiced or, if applicable, the
services have been rendered and it is reasonably assured that the corresponding receivable will be collected.

Expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, immediately in the case of outlays that are not going to generate
future financial profits or when they fail to comply with the necessary requirements for asset recognition.

Income and expenses are taken to the consolidated income statement on an accrual basis.

❖
Revenues on sales of assets are recognised when control of the assets is transferred, which generally

occurs when the assets are delivered (sent to the customer's specific location).

The Group engages in the manufacture and sale of parts for the automotive sector. Although the parts
are designed and manufactured exclusively for the customers and have no alternative uses for the Group,
revenue is recognised when control over them is transferred and not over time, since the Group does
not have an unconditional collection right for the execution performed at the close of each year.

❖
Revenues on the sale of project tools. In order to be able to manufacture the parts specifically for

customers, the Group incurs costs for mould design and manufacture. Once manufactured and approved
by the customer, the moulds become the property of the customer and the contracts indicate a separate
price for these moulds. The Group recognises this revenue under “Net turnover” in the consolidated
income statement when control of the tools is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs when
they pass the corresponding technical certification or verification by the customer. The Company's
Directors consider that even when the tools made for customers have no alternative use for the Group,
in the event that the order were to be rescinded by the customer, the Group has no right to receive
payment for performance up to that date, given that it would only have the right to collect the costs
incurred and not a reasonable profit margin. For this reason, tool manufacture is recorded as a
performance obligation satisfied at a specific moment.

Amounts billed in advance by the Group until control of these tools is transferred are recorded as a
liability under “Trade and other payables” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

Moreover, any final losses expected to be sustained on tools are recognised in full when such losses
become apparent, and the related provisions are recognised under this heading in the consolidated
income statement.

ii) Recognition of other revenue

❖
Ordinary revenue from the provision of services is recognised in line with the stage of completion of the

transaction at the end of the reporting period.

❖
Rental income is recorded on an accrual basis, with incentive benefits and the up-front costs of the lease

agreements being released on a straight-line basis.

❖
Capital grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as deferred income when

the Group has met the relevant qualifying conditions and there are, therefore, no reasonable doubts
about their collection. These capital grants are taken to profit or loss, under “Capital grants and other
grants taken to income” in the consolidated income statement, on a straight-line basis over the useful
lives of the subsidised assets.


-----

Government grants to cover or finance expenses incurred by the Group are recognised once all the
conditions attaching to them have been fulfilled and will be taken to income when the financed expenses
are incurred.

❖
Interest income and expense is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate method.

❖
Dividends received from other companies are recognised as income in the income statement when the

consolidated companies' right to receive them arises.

An expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement when there is a decrease in the future
economic benefits related to a reduction of an asset, or an increase in a liability, which can be measured
reliably. This means that the recognition of an expense takes place simultaneously to the recognition of the
increase in a liability or the reduction of an asset.

An expense is recognised immediately when a disbursement does not give rise to future economic benefits or
when the requirements for recognition as an asset are not met.

An expense is also recognised when a liability is incurred and no asset is recognised, as in the case of a liability
relating to a guarantee.

**o) Classification of assets and liabilities as current-**

In the consolidated statement of financial position, assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered,
consumed or settled in twelve months or less from the end of the reporting period are classified as current,
except for project tools, which are recorded as “Inventories” under “Current assets” in the consolidated
statement of financial position, since they are expected to be realised in the ordinary course of the Group's
business (as part of its normal operating cycle), and the liabilities connected with said inventories (customer
advances) which are recognised under “Current liabilities” in the consolidated statement of financial position,
regardless of when they fall due. When, prior to year-end, a liability does not give the Group an
unconditional right to defer settlement for at least twelve months from the date of the consolidated
statement of financial position, the liability is recorded as current.

**p) Discontinued operations-**

A discontinued operation is a line of business that it has been decided to abandon and/or sell whose assets,
liabilities and net profit or loss can be distinguished physically, operationally and for financial reporting
purposes. Revenues and expenses of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated
income statement. In 2022 the business activities of the Group’s subsidiaries in Russia were discontinued. In
this connection, as described in Note 6, in view of the specific monitoring of the impact of the military conflict
between Ukraine and Russia on the Group’s business in Russia, for management purposes a specific
geographical segment was created for the Russian market, which was effective from 1 January 2022.
Subsequently, in the last months of 2022 as a result of the continuation of the military conflict between
Ukraine and Russia and the fact that it was impossible for the Group’s two industrial subsidiaries in Russia
(Grupo Antolin-Saint Petersburg and Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Nóvgorod, Ltd.) to continue operating,
the Group decided to discontinue its business activities in Russia and launched a plan to sell these companies
that comprise the “Russian” market segment, which were classified as discontinued operations in the
consolidated financial statements for 2022 (see Note 25). For this reason, the assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries at 31 December 2022 were fully consolidated, but were recognised under “Non-current assets
classified as held for sale” and “Liabilities associated with non-current assets classified as held for sale” in
the consolidated statement of financial position, and the related income and expenses were included in the
accompanying consolidated income statement for 2022 separately under a single heading, “Profit/(Loss) for
the year from discontinued operations, net of tax”.

No line of business or business segment was discontinued in 2023.


-----

**q) Consolidated statement of cash flows-**

The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared according to the indirect method using the following
terms with the meanings given below:

  - Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, the latter being short-term, highly liquid
investments subject to low risk of changes in value.

  - Operating activities: the typical activities of companies in the motor parts industry and other activities
that cannot be classified as investing or financing activities.

  - Investment activities: the acquisition, sale or disposal by other means of non-current assets and other
investments not classified as cash and cash equivalents.

  - Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of equity and liabilities
that are not part of operating activities.

For the purposes of preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash and demand deposits at banks and highly liquid current investments which are easily convertible into
determinate cash amounts and are subject to insignificant risk as regards changes in value.

A reconciliation of the book value of the liabilities originated by financing activities, distinguishing between
the changes that give rise to cash flows due to “Proceeds from/(payments for) financial liabilities” (which are
recognised under “Cash flows from/(used in) financing activities” in the accompanying consolidated
statements of cash flows for 2023 and 2022) and those that do not, is given below:

-----

The assets and liabilities of Shanghai Antolin-Naen Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd. recognised at the acquisition
date, which were measured at fair value, and their amounts were not significant with respect to the consolidated
financial statements as a whole. The book values of the assets and liabilities recognised in this business
combinations do not significantly differ from the values at which they were carried in the books of the mentioned
company when the business was combined. The contingent liabilities of this company were guaranteed by the
seller.

As a result of the recognition of the assets and liabilities referred to above, at 31 December 2023 goodwill of
523 thousand euros arose, which was recognised under “Intangible assets - Goodwill” in the accompanying
consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 (see Note 7).

Also, in July 2022 the Group acquired a 51% stake in the share capital of Wuhan Antolin Auto Parts Co., Ltd. for
a price of practically zero (see Note 2-g). As a result of this operation, the Group now owns 100% of the share
capital of this company (at 31 December 2021 it owned 49%) and now controls it. As a consequence of the
recognition of the aforementioned assets and liabilities, on the acquisition date, which were measured at fair value
and the resulting amount was not material with respect to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,,
goodwill arose of 160 thousand euros, recorded under the consolidated statement of financial position heading
“Intangible assets-Goodwill” at 31 December 2022 (see Note 7).

**(6)** **INFORMATION BY SEGMENT**

The information by segment used by Group Management for management purposes is structured on the basis of
the Group's different business units, and also by geographical segment.

In each business unit the production plants are grouped in accordance with the specific product or activity, rather
than in accordance with the main activity of the company to which each plant belongs. This business unit or
segment structure is focused on the production and development of each type of product and allows the
operations of the businesses to be managed more efficiently.

Antolin’s main business units or segments, defined taking into account the nature of the products, are as follows:
“Technology Solutions” (formerly the “Lighting” segment), “Product Systems” (formerly the “Overheads & Soft
Trim” and the “Doors & Cockpits” segments) and “Other”. Moreover, in the later months of 2019 approval was
given to establish a new “Electronic Systems” business unit, that has been fully operational from a management
perspective since 2021 (part of the “Lighting” business unit, now “Technology Solutions”).

Also, effective from 1 January 2023, the subsidiary Grupo Antolin-Saltillo, S. de R.L. de C.V., which was formerly
included in the “Product Systems” segment, forms part of the “Technology Solutions” segment, although the
impact of this change in the information by segment from one reporting period to the other is scantly material.

In addition, there is a “Corporate Unit” (forming part of “Other”) that carries out global management of certain
assets and of the financing received by Antolin from third parties, as well as other minor activities. From 2022, it
also manages the expenses of the Technical - Commercial Offices (TCOs).

Moreover, up to and including 2022, the reported geographical segments related to “Asia-Pacific”, “Europe”,
“Mercosur”, “NAFTA” and “Africa” and, moreover, in 2022, due to the continuation of the military conflict
between Russia and Ukraine, it was decided to specifically monitor the Russian market, and management
information was prepared separately for the “Russia” geographical segment. However, in the last few months of
2022 Antolin decided to discontinue these activities (see Notes 3-p and 25). Also, as indicated in the preceding
paragraph, a geographical segment entitled “Other” has been defined. In 2023, following a review conducted by
Antolin in 2023 of the performance system by geographical segment, the “Europe”, “Mercosur” and “Africa”
geographical segments now report to the geographical segment entitled “Europe & ROW (“Rest Of the World”)”
and the “Asia-Pacific” and “NAFTA” geographical segments are now entitled Asia” and “North America”,
respectively.


-----

As a result of the changes in the segment reporting carried out in 2023, the segment information included in this
note for 2022 has been adapted to make it comparable to the information for 2023 and, therefore, differs from
the information reported in the consolidated financial statements for 2022.

**Basis and methodology for segment reporting-**

The business segment reports below are based on monthly reports prepared by the Group’s Management for
management purposes and are generated using the same computer application that is used to obtain all the
Group's accounting data. This information includes the segments relating to the Group’s continuing operations.
The segment reporting for 2022 does not include the “Russia” geographical segment, which was classified under
“Discontinued operations”. The information on this segment is included in Note 25.

The revenues reported for each segment are those which are directly attributable to the production plants
included in that segment for management purposes, so these also include secondary revenues that said plants may
have obtained from sales or the provision of services to other segments. The revenue of each segment does not
include interest or dividend income or the gains on sales of investments or of non-current assets.

The expenses of each segment are calculated as being the expenses arising out of the operating activities of the
segment that may be directly attributed to the plants included in that segment for management purposes. The
expenses of each segment do not include interest expense, impairment or losses on sales of investments or of
non-current assets.

Assets and liabilities in the segments are those that are directly connected with the operations of the plants in
each segment, although virtually all of the financial debt of the Group has been centralised in the Corporate Unit.

Impairment tests
At the end of each reporting period, the Group estimates whether there has been any impairment that reduces
the recoverable value of goodwill to less than its book value and, if there is any impairment, makes any value
adjustments necessary. The policies applied by the Group to test goodwill for impairment are described in Note
3-a.

In this respect, at 31 December 2023, the Group carried out the corresponding analyses, evaluating the
recoverable amount of the cash generating units associated with goodwill (substantially all of which corresponds
to consolidated subsidiaries which are currently generating profits or are expected to do so in coming years as
certain projects are launched) by reference to the fair value less costs to sell, calculated on the basis of cash flow
projections that represent best estimates, covering a period of five years and with a terminal value estimated
assuming a perpetuity growth rate. To determine the recoverable amounts, at the close of 2023 the Group's
Directors reviewed and updated the assumptions of their forecasts relating to the activities and future results of
the corresponding businesses and their impact on cash flows, and the performance of the main variables foreseen
in the budgets approved for 2024 and the business plans (approved by the Board of Directors). The fair value
hierarchy according to IFRS 13, in which fair value measurement was classified in its entirety, was Level 3, without
considering whether the costs of sale or disposable by any other means are observable.

The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of this impairment test varies from country to country and
ranges from 9% to 12.5%, while in 2022 this range was at levels between 8.5% and 12%. The terminal value is
calculated assuming sustainable average cash flows and a forecast growth rate of 1%.

The conclusion drawn by the Group from this analysis is that the recoverable value of its goodwill is greater than
the book value recorded.

Therefore, at 2023 and 2022 year-end, the Group had not adjusted any amount whatsoever for this goodwill.

Group Management has also performed a sensitivity analysis and estimates that, even if the anticipated growth in
sales is not achieved (and current levels are maintained) and/or the discount rates increase, no significant risks of
impairment are foreseen. The main assumptions used were a +0.5% increase in the discount rate and a -0.5%
reduction in the perpetuity growth rate.

Development expenditure
Capitalised (internal) development expenditure at 31 December 2023 corresponds to a range of projects relating
to overheads and soft trim, trays, panels, consoles and automobile mechanisms. A portion of the capitalised
development expenditure (approximately 210 million euros) corresponds to projects in progress at 31 December
2023 (approximately 79 million euros at 31 December 2022), and, accordingly, the related expenses will not
start to be amortised until the projects have been completed. The Parent’s Directors forecast that during 2024
and 2025 most of the development projects under way at 31 December 2023 will be completed, at which time
the corresponding products will go into mass production.

The main additions to development expenditure in 2023 (which amounts to 106.6 million euros) correspond to
the Chevrolet “G1Yx (Traverse)”, Porsche “Macan NF PO426 EU22 IP”, Jeep “Cherokee Panel”, Audi “Q7/Q9
Panel”, Mini “F6X EU24 IP”, Cadillac “l232 EV” PlasticP, Ford “Puma Console” and Renault “5 ECHO Panel”
projects. Mass production for some of these projects began in 2023.


-----

The main reductions in development expenditure in 2023 correspond principally to the derecognition of
development expenditure for certain projects that had been almost fully amortised and/or had become impaired.
As a result of these derecognitions, the Group recognised a net loss of 229 thousand euros in 2023 under
“Profit/(Loss) on the disposal of non-current assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statement (424
thousand euros in 2022).

Other intangible assets
At 31 December 2023, the balance of this heading basically corresponds to certain considerations paid by the
Group to customers for being awarded and securing contracts to produce and supply parts and components for
these customers' projects. These incremental costs of securing orders or contracts were capitalised as it is deemed
likely that profits or economic benefits will be obtained from the production and sale of the corresponding parts
and components, enabling these costs to be recovered.

No individual intangible assets exist that are significant in the entity's financial statements.

Impairment losses
Intangible assets not available for use are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with IAS 36. In this
regard, at 31 December 2023, the Group analysed asset recoverability at individual project level and production
plant, on the basis of the technical and financial viability of the projects under development, using the fair value
less costs to sell method.

In addition, at the end of every reporting period, Antolin reviews the book values of its intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss. Should any such
signs of impairment exist, the recoverable amount of these assets is determined in order to quantify any impairment
loss suffered. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit associated with these intangible assets was
measured by reference to its value in use which was calculated based on best estimates of cash flows over the
life of the corresponding project.

The pre-tax discount rate used for the purposes of these impairment tests varies from country to country and
ranges between 9% and 12.5% (for businesses in Western Europe, the US, Morocco, China, Korea, Thailand, India
and Mexico), is 14% (for businesses in Brazil and South Africa), 22% (for businesses in Turkey) and 75% (for
businesses in Argentina), In 2022, these rates ranged between 8.5% and 18%.

In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual
growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in
use. This analysis did not lead to the conclusion that there was any significant risk of impairment. The main
assumptions used were a +0.5% increase in the discount rate and a -0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate.

Accordingly, at 31 December 2023, the Group recorded provisions for impairment totalling 110,589 thousand
euros (138,042 thousand at 31 December 2022), corresponding to a decrease in the value of the development
expenditure and other intangible assets capitalised for certain projects which are currently loss-making, and for
which the recoverable value is lower than their book value. Approximately 27,347 thousand euros of this amount
was recognised under "Net impairment losses on non-current assets" in the accompanying consolidated income
statement for 2023 (approximately 85,025 thousand euros in 2022). In addition, impairment losses of 2,877
thousand euros were reversed in 2023 with a charge to the aforementioned balance of the consolidated income
statement (no impairment provisions were reversed with a charge to this heading of the consolidated income
statement for 2022).

Fully amortised assets
The Group's intangible assets include certain assets which had been fully amortised at 31 December 2023 and
2022. The total cost and related accumulated amortisation of these assets amounted to 313 and 277 million
euros, respectively.

The main additions to the Group's property, plant and equipment in 2022 corresponded to investments made to
expand its production facilities, some of which were in progress at 31 December 2022. These investments include
most notably those made by Grupo Antolin Bohemia, a.s., Grupo Antolin Turnov, s.r.o. (Czech Republic), Grupo
Antolin-Kentucky, Inc. (United States), Grupo Antolin-Bamberg, GmbH & Co. KG (Germany), Grupo AntolinSibiu, S.R.L. (Romania), Antolin Interiors México, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) and in the Howell plant, owned by Antolin
Interiors USA, Inc.

The most significant derecognitions in 2023 correspond to the retirement of machinery and other items, most of
which had been depreciated in full and were not being used by the companies in their production activities.

The most significant derecognitions in 2022 corresponded to the derecognition of property, plant and equipment
of Chongqing Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hanzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and
Antolin Spartanburg Assembly, Inc., which were excluded from the scope of consolidation during the year (see
Note 2-g); and to the retirement of machinery and other items of other plants, most of which had been fully
depreciated and were not being used by the companies in their production activities.

As a result of these derecognitions the Group recognised a loss of 8.608 thousand euros in 2023, which was taken
to income under “Gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets” in the accompanying consolidated income
statement (834 thousand euros in 2022).

On the other hand, in 2022 the Group sold land located in Burgos, which was recognised under “Investment
property” in the consolidated statement of financial position. On this transaction, the Group obtained a loss of
approximately 0.6 million euros, which was taken to income under "Gains or losses on disposals of non-current
assets" in the accompanying consolidated income statement.

**Land-**

The cost of "Land and constructions" at 31 December 2023 and 2022 includes 34,943 and 34,926 thousand euros,
respectively, corresponding to the book value of the land at those dates.

The Group's land holdings in the Iberian Peninsula were stated at their fair value at the date of transition to IFRSEU (1 January 2006) in accordance with the stipulations of IFRS 1. The highest value attributed to said assets at 31
December 2023 and 2022 was 16,187 thousand euros (corresponding to property, plant and equipment and the
rest to investment properties) and was determined on the basis of valuations performed by independent experts
based on market prices or estimated discounted future cash flows.

**Investment budget for 2024-**

In 2024 the Group's Directors plan to invest 107,411 thousand euros in property, plant and equipment as broken
down below:

Thousands of

Investments are planned for many of the Group's plants, the most significant of which are those for machinery and
facilities in Grupo Antolin-Michigan, Inc., Suzhou Antolin Automotive Interiors Co., Ltd., Grupo Antolin-Silao,
S.A. de C.V., Antolin Liban, s.r.o. and Antolin Nashville, LLC.

(a) These movements correspond to new contracts or the finalisation of others, translation differences and updating of calculations
and are net of the effect of exclusions of companies from the scope of consolidation (see Note 2-g), and the re-classification to
of subsidiaries to “Non-current assets held for sale” in 2022 (see Notes 3-f and 25).

The discount rate used at 31 December 2023 and 2022 to determine the present value of lease liabilities at those
dates generally ranged between 0.5% and 8.75%, depending on each company's financial position and its finance
costs. The overall average rate was around 2.69% (overall average rate of 2.68% in 2022).

**Finance leases (leasing)-**

**Operating leases-**

Some of the consolidated companies lease buildings which house a part of their warehouses, production facilities
and offices, as well as machinery, vehicles and other PP&E. As indicated in Note 3-e, IFRS 16, Leases was applied
when recognising the corresponding leases executed with the owners of these assets in the consolidated financial
statements.

In addition to recognising the aforementioned leases in accordance with IFRS 16, Antolin benefits from the
exceptions set out in IFRS 16 for contracts classified as “low value leases”, for long and short-term contracts,
and for short-term contracts even when the leases are not low value.

The lease expense of these leases of low-value or short-term contracts in 2023 and 2022 totalled 23,971 and
17,791 thousand euros, respectively, and was recognised under “Other operating expenses” in the accompanying
consolidated income statement (see Note 20).

At 31 December 2023, the leases of low-value and short-term operating lease agreements the Group was party
to at that date gave rise to the following future lease payments to lessors falling due as shown:

**Impairment losses-**

At the date of each consolidated statement of financial position, or at the end of each reporting period, the Group
tests for any internal or external signs that the recoverable amount of its cash-generating units is less than the
book value. If so, the book value is reduced to the recoverable value and the future charges for depreciation are
adjusted in proportion to their adjusted book value and the new remaining useful life if it was also necessary to
re-estimate this. Any such reduction in the book value of property, plant and equipment for own use is charged
to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement.

Similarly, whenever there are signs that the value of an impaired asset has recovered, the consolidated companies
reverse impairment losses recognised in prior years. The increased book value may not exceed the book value
that would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset.

In this regard, at 31 December 2023 the Group's consolidated companies tested for signs of impairment of their
property, plant and equipment, of their cash-generating units (productive plant) and at the level of each project
for development expenses to which those assets are assigned and at production plant level, and when identified,
they proceeded to quantify the related recoverable amount. Where the asset does not itself generate cash inflows
that are independent of those from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash
generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value (less costs to sell) and its value in use. In calculating
value in use at 31 December 2023, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a
pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific
to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. These future cash flows are
derived from the forecasts made by Antolin for each cash generating unit for a period of five years (using
assumptions concerning changes in sale prices, costs and volumes based on experience and future expectations in
accordance with the currently approved strategic plan and the budget for the coming year), with a residual value
calculated using a growth rate of 1%. The pre-tax discount rate used for the purposes of these impairment tests
varies from country to country and ranges between 9% and 12.5% (for businesses in Western Europe, the US,
Morocco, China, Korea, Thailand, India and Mexico), is 14% (for businesses in Brazil and South Africa), 22% (for
businesses in Turkey) and 75% (for businesses in Argentina), In 2022, these rates ranged between 8.5% and 18%.

In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual
growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in
use. This analysis did not lead to the conclusion that there was any risk of impairment. The main assumptions
used were a +0.5 basis points increase in the discount rate and a -0.5 basis points reduction in the perpetuity
growth rate.

Based on this analysis, at 31 December 2023 the Group recognise impairment losses on property, plant and
equipment totalling 64,202 thousand euros (of which a net amount of 3,987 thousand euros were recognised in
2023, 59,547 thousand euros in 2022 and the rest in years prior to 2022). These losses basically correspond to
the loss of property, plant and equipment at the plants owned by Grupo Antolin-Kentucky, Inc., Grupo AntolinMichigan, Inc., Antolin Liban, s.r.o., Grupo Antolin Bohemia, a.s. and Grupo Antolin Bratislava, s.r.o. for projects
that are currently generating losses or have done so in the past and whose recoverable amount is below their
book value (at 31 December 2022, the Group had recognised impairment losses in the amount of 62,683 thousand
euros).

**Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment-**

The Group's property, plant and equipment include certain assets which had been fully depreciated at 31
December 2023 and 2022. The total cost and related accumulated depreciation of these assets amounted to 950
and 712 million euros, respectively.

**Insurance policy-**

The Group takes out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which its property, plant and equipment are
exposed. The Parent's Directors consider that the policies taken out are adequate in view of the various locations
of its property, plant and equipment.

**(9)** **NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OTHER CURRENT**
**FINANCIAL ASSETS**

The balances under these headings in the consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2023 and
2022 are broken down below by type:

Thousands of Euros
31/12/23 31/12/22
Non-Current Current Non-Current Current

Non-current investment securities 872            - 945            Other financial assets
Non-current receivables from Group companies 717            - 651            Other receivables 326 2,337 326 1,789
Guarantee deposits and deposits given 3,769 1,782 5,937 1,852
**Net total** **5,684** **4,119** **7,859** **3,641**

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, the fair value of these assets did not differ significantly from their book value.
Antolin’s financial assets measured at fair value are at level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Non-current investment securities-**

The balances of this item at 31 December 2023 and 2022 correspond to various non-controlling interests in nonlisted companies.

In February 2020, the Group and Eyesight Mobile Technologies, Ltd. (an Israeli company, now called CIPIA, that
is a leading provider of in-car vision solutions using artificial intelligence) entered into a Simple Agreement for
Future Equity (“SAFE”), under which this provider will supply the Group and work with it to develop driver and
passenger monitoring systems. Pursuant to the agreement, in 2020 the Group paid this company an amount
equivalent to 2,780 thousand euros, which it is planned will become a convertible loan and, subsequently, a
minority equity stake in this Israeli company. This is dependent on certain conditions being met and certain
circumstances arising, which have not yet occurred. Consequently, at 31 December 2022 the aforementioned
amount was recognised as “Other financial assets - Guarantees and deposits given” under “Non-current assets”
in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at that date, given the intended long-term nature
of the relationship with this third party and of the investment that may materialise. At 31 December 2023, Antolin
recognised this balance under “Non-current financial assets - Non-current investment securities” in the
accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023, having recognised an impairment
loss of 2,442 thousand euros under “Finance costs” in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2023.

**Other financial assets-**

Non-current receivables from group companies

The balances of “Non-current receivables from group companies" at 31 December 2023 and 2022 include the
balance receivable of the long-term cash-pooling account held by the Parent with Avot Inversiones, S.L., with
maturities established on 31 December 2025 and 2024, respectively, which bears annual interest at a market rate
and is revised annually (see Note 21).

**(10)** **INVENTORIES**

Antolin’s inventories at 31 December 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

||702,158|621,449|


**Project tools in progress-**

The balances of this item at 31 December 2023 and 2022 correspond to the costs incurred by the Group on the
project tools being manufactured at those dates. At 31 December 2023 and 2022, Antolin had billed the related
customers approximately 189 and 166 million euros, respectively, as advances, which are recorded as current
liabilities under “Trade and other payables” in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position.

The Directors of the Parent expect substantially all of the project tools being manufactured at 31 December
2023 to be settled in 2024.

**Insurance policy-**

The Group takes out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which practically all its inventories are
exposed. In the opinion of the Parent's Directors, the cover provided by the policies taken out at 31 December
2023 is sufficient.

**(11)** **OTHER RECEIVABLES**

The composition of other receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023
and 2022 is as follows:

and series), with a par value of 4.67 euros each, fully subscribed and paid up.

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, all the share capital of the Parent was held indirectly by Avot Inversiones, S.L.
(parent of the Parent's current and previous shareholders), a company whose Registered offices are in Burgos and
whose owners are members of the Antolin family (see Note 1). All the Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. shares carry
the same voting and dividend rights, although they are distinguished by their transfer regime.

At 31 December 2022, all Parent shares were pledged in guarantee of compliance with the obligations deriving
from the secured bonds issued in 2021 and 2018 by the Parent, as well as the financing agreement known as the
“Senior Facilities Agreement” that the Parent executed with several financial institutions, the loan granted by the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and a loan granted by the Compañía Española de Financiación del Desarrollo
(COFIDES), which adhered to the “Intercreditor Agreement”, that governs relations among the Group's financial
creditors (see Note 17).

**Additional paid-in capital-**

The revised text of the Spanish Corporate Enterprise Act expressly allows the use of the additional paid-in capital
balance to increase share capital and establishes no specific restrictions as to its use.

**Other reserves of the Parent-**

This heading in the consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2023 and 2022 includes the
following reserves:

Legal reserve
The revised text of the Spanish Corporate Enterprise Act stipulates that 10% of the net profits of the year must
be appropriated to the legal reserve until it reaches at least 20% of share capital. At 31 December 2023 and 2022,
the legal reserve amounted to 7,494 thousand euros (equivalent to 20% of share capital).

The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below
10% of the increased share capital amount. Otherwise, when the legal reserve does not exceed 20% of share
capital, it can only be used to offset losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this
purpose.

Capitalisation reserve
The Parent's “Capitalisation reserve” at 31 December 2023 and 2022 amounted to 5,800 thousand euros. This
reserve was established in compliance with Law 27/2014, of 27 November, on Corporate Income Tax and is
restricted for 5 years from the end of the year to which the reduction in the final taxable income for corporate
income tax corresponds (consequently, 4,000 thousand euros have been restricted since 31 December 2022,
while 1,800 thousand euros were no longer restricted as of 31 December 2020). Its amount is the same as the
amount of the reduction in the final tax base applied for this item in the Spanish consolidated tax group's corporate
income tax return for 2015 and 2017.


-----

Other reserves
The balance under this heading at 31 December 2023 includes losses carried forward from previous financial
years (316,005 thousand euros) and other unrestricted reserves of the Parent.

**Distribution of dividends-**

Dividends distributed in 2023 and 2022
On 27 April 2023, the Parent’s sole shareholder resolved to distribute a dividend of 6,300 thousand euros with
a charge to unrestricted reserves. In respect of this dividend, the Parent complied with the limitations imposed by
the financing agreements in force when the dividend was paid. The Parent did not distribute any dividends in 2022.

Restrictions on the distribution of dividends
As indicated in Note 17, on 21 March 2014 the Parent executed a “Senior Facility Agreement” with major Spanish
and international financial institutions, which has been successively amended and novated; the last novation of
which took place in December 2021. Under this agreement, the Group obtained financing by means of a syndicated
loan (“Loan Facility”) (whose outstanding balance at 31 December 2022 was 353,860 thousand euros) and a multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility with an initial limit of 200 million euros (rising to 193,550 thousand euros, of
which 4,450 thousand euros have been established as a line of bank guarantees and 189,100 thousand euros are
directly linked to the line of credit). In addition, an “Intercreditor Agreement” was executed to govern relations
among creditors: bond holders, financial institutions, the European Investment Bank (EIB), which adhered in 2018,
and the Compañía Española de Financiación de Desarrollo (COFIDES), which adhered in 2021 as a result of the
financing granted to the Group. These financing agreements allow the distribution of dividends provided certain
requirements are met. These include:

  - If the Group's debt-equity ratio is less than 3.50 but higher than 3.50, the dividend distributed with a charge
to the Group’s net consolidated profit may not exceed 25%.

  - If the Group's debt-equity ratio is less than 2.50, the dividends distributed may not exceed 50% of its
consolidated net profit.

**Capital management-**

The Group's capital management focuses on achieving a financial structure that optimises the cost of capital to
ensure a sound financial position. This policy enables value creation for shareholders to be compatible with access
to financial markets at a competitive cost to cover the needs for refinancing debt and financing the investment
plan not covered by the funds generated by the business.

In this regard, in line with standard practice in the business world and in the industry in which it operates, the
Group uses the following ratios to analyse its situation, calculated based on the ratios established in the syndicated
senior loan facility:

- Financial leverage (Net borrowing/net equity attributable to the Parent): The Group's ratio at 31 December
2022 was 2.23. At the end of 2023, it was 3.94.

- Debt-to-income (Net borrowing/EBITDA): The Group's ratio at 31 December 2022 was 3.46. At the end of
2023, it was 3.02.

- Interest coverage (EBITDA/Net Finance Income): The Group's ratio at 31 December 2022 was 6.53. At the
end of 2023, it was 4.92.

As stated in Note 17, the Group has been granted loans by third parties, which require certain specific financial
ratios to be achieved.

The number of shares outstanding at 31 December 2023 and 2022 was 8,023,241.

**Diluted earnings/(loss) per share-**

Diluted earnings/(loss) per share are calculated in much the same way as basic earnings per share, but the weighted
average number of shares outstanding is adjusted to take into account the potential diluting effect of the share
options, warrants and convertible debt current at the year-end.

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, diluted earnings/(loss) per share were the same as basic earnings/(loss) per share
as the Group had no diluting instruments.

from 3.2% to 9.5% while at 2022 year-end they ranged from 1.10% to 9.48%).

**Other provisions-**

The balance of other “Non-current provisions” at 31 December 2023 essentially comprises provisions set up to
meet commitments with the personnel of some other consolidated companies not included under “Provisions for
pension commitments and similar” (10,062 thousand euros), some claims by suppliers and/or customers for
retroactive pricing and similar arrangements (25,587 thousand euros), and future losses deriving from onerous
contracts which are expected to be incurred in the long term (1,589 thousand euros), as well as provisions for
the reversal or dismantling of assets (12,731 thousand euros), and claims by suppliers and/or customers for
warranties (3,872 thousand euros), restructuring (6,280 thousand euros), taxes (11,123 thousand euros) and
various liabilities incurred during the normal course of their operations (8,408 thousand euros).

Neither the legal and tax advisers of the Group nor the Directors of the Parent expect any of these proceedings
and claims pending resolution at 31 December 2022 to produce a material impact on the consolidated financial
statements for the years in which said proceedings are concluded.

**Current provisions-**

The balance of the other current provisions at 31 December 2023 relates mainly to the provisions recognised to
meet certain commitments with suppliers and/or customers for retroactive pricing arrangements and similar
(13,146 thousand euros), claims by suppliers and/or customers for warranties (1,573 thousand euros),
restructuring (1,013 thousand euros) and for certain liabilities arising in the normal course of Antolin’s business
activities (30,215 thousand euros).

with these limits and commitments.

**Syndicated Loan Facility, and multi-currency Revolving**
**Credit Facility-**

On 13 March 2014, the Parent signed a “Senior Facilities Agreement” with major Spanish and international financial
institutions under which Antolin obtained financing by means of a 200-million-euro syndicated Loan Facility, and
a multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility with a 200-million-euro limit. Subsequently, in June 2015 a 200-millioneuro extension to the syndicated Loan Facility was entered into, increasing the capital of said loan to 400 million
euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent by 31 December 2015.

On 26 October 2016, Antolin signed a novation of the “Senior Facilities Agreement”, amending the repayment
schedule, extending the final maturity date of the contract to 2021 (originally this was 2020), and modifying the
interest rate (Euribor plus a market spread) thereby reducing the Group’s finance costs.

Also, on 27 April 2018, a change to the “Senior Facilities Agreement” (“Amendment and Restatement
Agreement”) was signed, increasing the syndicated loan by 50 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent
in 2018. The amount of the loan was 419,204 thousand euros and it was divided into three tranches. In this
modification of the loan a new financial institution became a lender (HSBC Bank plc), the final maturity of the
contract was extended until 2023, and the repayment schedule was changed as was the interest rate, reducing the
cost of this financing.


-----

Additionally, on 3 June 2020 a new amendment to this financing agreement was executed, which allowed Antolin
the possibility of additional financing for an aggregate amount of up to 200 million euros.

In 2021 the Parent completed a process to refinance the “Senior Facilities Agreement” (“Amendment and
Restatement Agreement”) in order to extend the repayment schedule. In this loan amendment a new financial
institution became a lender (Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO)), the final maturity of the agreement was extended
to 2026 and the repayment schedule and applicable interest rate were modified. In accordance with IFRS 9
requirements, Antolin checked that the present value of the cash flows deducted under the new conditions, using
the original effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by less than 10% from the present discounted value
of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. Antolin calculated the differential amount of the
present value of the future contractual cash flows discounted at the debt's original effective interest rate with
respect to the amortised cost recorded without reaching a significant quantity for recognition in the consolidated
financial statements for 2021.

In relation to the multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, with the inclusion of the Instituto de Crédito Oficial
(ICO) as a lender, it was agreed to reduce the total available amount from 200 million euros (initially granted)
to 193,550 thousand euros, of which 4,450 thousand euros has been set up as a bank guarantee facility and 189,100
thousand euros are directly linked to the credit facility.

Lastly, in 2022 a new amendment to this financing agreement was executed, under which certain adjustments were
included in relation to the financial ratios which the Group is required to achieve, taking into account the
restructuring costs and the synergies included in the 2023-2026 Business plan.

In 2023 and 2022, the Group repaid 15,727 and 16,127 thousand euros, respectively, of these financing agreements.

The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2023 and 2022 was 353,860 and 369,587
thousand euros, respectively, since at those dates the Parent had not drawn down any amount against the multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2023 and
2022 had the following repayment schedule:

At 31/12/22 15,727 31,454 157,271 165,135 **369,587**

Notwithstanding the above schedule, Antolin may, at any moment during the life of the loan, opt to repay all or
part of the outstanding syndicated loan or multi-currency revolving credit facility, provided certain conditions are
met. Furthermore, the following events will trigger full or partial early repayment of these loans:

- Subject to certain exceptions and amounts, the disposal of specific asset categories, the receipt of indemnities
from insurance companies or the flotation of the Parent (with no change of control of the Group).

- In the event of a change of control in the Group, any of the financial institutions may decide to leave the
financing arrangements in place or may request early repayment of the proportional part of the loan
corresponding to said institution.

Interest
These loans accrue annual interest tied to the Euribor, plus a variable market spread, which is reviewed annually
on the basis of certain financial ratios.

-----

In the novation formalised on 5 May 2021, the multi-currency revolving credit facility was linked to the
achievement of certain environmental, social and corporate governance-related performance indicators by
Antolin. Antolin must also pay a commission with respect to the undrawn amount of the multi-currency revolving
credit facility.

Loan guarantees
These loans are backed by an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee from a significant number of the companies
forming the Group, although the guarantees provided by some subsidiaries (specifically certain Portuguese, Czech
and German companies) are limited to amounts established by the applicable local legislation. In order to comply
with the obligations related to these loans, Antolin has given a commitment to each of the subsidiaries in which
it holds at least 90% of the share capital that it will become a guarantor if the following circumstances arise: its
EBITDA for the year represents at least 2.5% of the Group's EBITDA and exceeds 5 million euros.

In addition, liens have been established on the share capital of the Parent (see Note 13).

Early repayment
The Senior Facilities Agreement under which these loans were granted includes clauses specifying that the
following events will trigger their full early repayment:

- Failure to repay the principal or pay the interest on the loans as and when they fall due.

- Failure of the Group to achieve the financial ratios set in the agreement under which these loans were granted
or to remedy said failure within 20 days of the issue of the “ratio compliance certificate” in which they are
detailed.

- Failure to comply with other obligations established in the loan agreement (false disclosures, failure to
provide information, etc.) without rectifying said failure within a determined period.

- Failure to pay other borrowings falling due, provided certain circumstances are met, or the insolvency of the
Parent, a material subsidiary, or the shareholders.

- A change in the ownership of the shares of the Parent, or the closure of businesses, expropriation, lawsuits
and legal claims, the seizure of or embargoes on assets, material changes and any other circumstances which
have a material adverse effect on the Group. The loans will also be repayable if the Group's auditors issue a
disclaimer of opinion, or an adverse or qualified opinion.

At 31 December 2023, the Parent's Directors considered that all the clauses and obligations set out in the
financing agreement and their subsequent amendments had been fulfilled, and that no grounds for early maturity
or partial or total early repayment had occurred. They also consider that all conditions will be met in the
following 12 months from the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements.

Other obligations and commitments
The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain obligations and commitments limiting the Group's capacity to
perform certain operations during the life of the loans, including the following:

- Limits on obtaining additional financing, the constitution of charges or guarantees against its assets, and the
granting of guarantees or sureties to third parties.

- Limits on the sale, cession, transfer or other forms of disposal of its assets.

- Limits on the acquisition of companies or businesses.

- Limits on the distribution of dividends by the Parent (see Note 13).

**Long-term loan granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB)-**

On 12 June 2018, the Parent and the European Investment Bank, and other Group companies as guarantors, signed
a contract by which said entity granted the Group a long-term loan of 100,000 thousand euros, to finance a project
called “Antolin Car Interiors RDI”, implementing the Group's R&D and innovation strategy for the development
of new solutions for vehicle interiors. The total planned investment in the project was 217,172 thousand euros,
which had to be implemented by various Group companies located in Spain, Germany and France between 2018
and 2020.

The principal is repaid in 14 half-yearly instalments of equal amounts, the first of which fell due on 30 November
2021 and the last of which falls due on 31 May 2028.

On 23 December 2020, the Parent executed a new agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB), under
which it increased the amount of financing granted to the “Antolin Car Interiors RDI” project by 40,000 thousand
euros, which had been drawn down by the Parent at 31 December 2021. The amount of this loan extension is
repaid in half-yearly instalments, the first of which fell due on 31 January 2023 and the last of which falls due on
30 June 2028.

This loan accrues fixed annual interest and is backed by a joint and several guarantee from various group
companies, acting as guarantors.

Therefore, at 31 December 2023 and 2022 the outstanding principal of this loan amounted to 97,619 thousand
euros and 118,571 thousand euros, respectively, with the following repayment schedule:

The European Investment Bank (EIB) has signed the intercreditor agreement which governs relations between
bondholders, financial creditors and the Group, having agreed to adopt the covenants and conditions for the
distribution of dividends envisaged in the loan agreements for the “Antolin Car Interiors RDI” project, as well as
the guarantees, causes of early repayment and other obligations and commitments established in the
aforementioned intercreditor agreement. The causes of obligatory partial or total repayment of the loan include
failure to make the envisaged investments or the reduction of the cost of the project to a certain amount.

Lastly, in 2022 a new amendment to this loan agreement was formalised, introducing certain adjustments to the
financial ratios which the Group is required to achieve, taking into account the restructuring costs and the synergies
included in the 2023-2026 Business Plan.

In the light of this accession to the intercreditor agreement and the conditions established in the loan agreements,
at 31 December 2023 the Parent's Directors considered that all the clauses and obligations set out in the loan
agreements had been fulfilled and no event which could trigger full or partial early repayment had occurred.
They also considered that all conditions will be met in the next 12 months from the date of authorisation for
issue of these consolidated financial statements.

**COFIDES Loan-**

On 28 July 2021, the Parent and Compañía Española de Financiación del Desarrollo (COFIDES) executed an

(a) This amount includes a current account overdraft limit of 17,000 thousand euros granted to the Group

as part of a framework agreement with a financial institution for the provision of banking services.

The Directors of the Parent foresee no difficulty renewing these credit lines when they expire.

Also, in March 2014 Antolin arranged a multi-currency long-term Revolving Credit Facility with an initial limit of
200 million euros. This amount was reduced in 2023 to a limit of 189,100 thousand euros and maturity was set
at 30 June 2026. 50,000 thousand euros had been drawn down against the aforementioned credit facility at 31
December 2023. As a result, at 31 December 2023, the undrawn amount available to Antolin from credit lines
and overdraft facilities totalled 194,178 thousand euros. These credit lines and overdraft facilities accrue interest
at variable market rates.

**Factoring lines-**

At 31 December 2023, Antolin had executed recourse and non-recourse factoring agreements with several
financial institutions. At that date outstanding receivables assigned without recourse to financial institutions
amounted to 193,236 thousand euros (122,605 thousand euros at 31 December 2022). As this involved
transferring part of the risks and benefits of the assets and control thereof, Antolin directly reduced its trade
receivables by the amount of the receivables assigned to the financial institutions and did not, therefore, recognise
any financial liability in this connection.

Also, in relation to these factoring agreements, at 31 December 2023 Antolin had 30,711 thousand euros pending
payment to financial institutions in respect of collections made by these in the final days of December 2023
regarding invoices ceded to these entities (4,092 thousand euros at 31 de December 2022). This amount, which is
included under liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023
as payable to the corresponding entities, was paid in the first few days of 2024.

**Payables under finance leases-**

The lease payments outstanding at 31 December 2023 and 2022, including the purchase options, fall due as

**Loans granted by Spanish and Portuguese public authorities-**

Most of the balances under this heading at 31 December 2023 and 2022 corresponded to loans granted to the
Group by certain Spanish public authorities to finance research and development projects and improve
competitiveness. In 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Ministry for Industry, Tourism and Trade, through the Plan
for Competitiveness of the Automotive Industry, granted long-term interest-free loans to Antolin. In general,
these loans must be repaid in 10 regular annual instalments falling due between 2015 and 2027.

The nominal amount of these and other loans granted by Spanish and Portuguese public authorities outstanding
at 31 December 2023 and 2022 (which are recorded at said dates at their amortised cost) will be repaid in
accordance with the following repayment schedule:

**Corporate income tax-**

As indicated in Note 3-m, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and all of its consolidated Spanish subsidiaries domiciled
in Spanish “common territory” in which it has holdings of 75% or more file consolidated corporate income tax
returns. The parent of the consolidated tax group under which these companies file is Avot Inversiones, S.L. (until
31 December 2014 the parent of the consolidated tax group was Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.).

The corporate income tax charge is calculated for each consolidated subsidiary based on accounting profit,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which need not coincide with taxable
income, the latter being the tax base.

The reconciliation of consolidated accounting profit or loss to the respective tax bases for corporate income tax
purposes for 2023 and 2022 is as follows:

For which no tax credit had been recorded (17,011) (7,973)
**Consolidated taxable income** **93,586** **90,273**

(a) The most significant increases and decreases correspond to the recognition of certain provisions and to other expenses

incurred, which the Group considers non-deductible (temporary differences). 2022 also includes the adjustment for
the impairment of recognised tangible and intangible assets, and the change in tax legislation regarding the amortisation
of R&D expenditure, which applies to the consolidated companies in the United States.

The balance under “Current investments in Group companies and associates” in the accompanying consolidated
statement of financial position at 31 December 2023, amounting to 1,995 thousand euros, corresponds to the
estimated tax receivable from Avot Inversiones, S.L. (Parent of the Spanish consolidated tax Group) derived from
taxable income, deductions, withholdings and payments on account furnished by the Group's Spanish companies
to the 2023 consolidated income tax return (911 thousand euros at 31 December 2022 recorded under the same
heading in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at that date).

**Corporate income tax expense/(benefit)-**

The balances of the “Corporate income tax” heading in the consolidated income statements for the financial years
ended 31 December 2023 and 2022 were determined as follows:

Thousands of Euros
2023 2022

**Consolidated profit/(loss) for the year before tax:**

**Corporate income tax expense/(benefit) attributable to continuing**

**operations (balance of “Corporate income tax” in the consolidated**
**income statement)** **(20,001)** **10,753**

(a) Corresponds to tax paid in other countries on dividends, interest and other amounts paid to the Parent and other
consolidated subsidiaries for which said companies have made no deductions.

**Tax loss carryforwards-**

Although at 31 December 2023 some of the consolidated companies had very significant tax loss carryforwards
(around 861 million euros in total), the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at that date
only includes a tax credit of 44,683 thousand euros relating to the tax effect of the tax loss carryforwards, the
offsetting of which can reasonably be expected to be applied (basically, they correspond to tax losses generated
in 2009, 2011, 2012, 2021 and 2022 by the Spanish consolidated tax group, and tax losses generated, mainly, by
French, Chinese, Mexican, British, German, Brazilian, Czech, Indian and Italian companies).

Tax losses generated in a given year can be carried forward for offset against the taxable income of the immediately
following years, as established in the tax legislation of the countries in which the consolidated companies are
located.

**Foreign subsidiaries-**

At 31 December 2023, no dividend distributions had been proposed by foreign consolidated subsidiaries and
associates which were pending execution. Nevertheless, at that date it was envisaged that dividends would be
distributed by certain subsidiaries in the coming years with a charge to existing reserves. Consequently, and based
on estimates made, at 31 December 2023 a deferred tax liability of 1,677 thousand euros was recognised in this
connection due to the tax effect these pay-outs would have on the Group. This deferred tax liability has been
charged to “Corporate income tax” in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2023.

The movements in 2022 and 2023 under “Deferred tax assets” and “Deferred tax liabilities” in the consolidated
statement of financial position were as follows:

**Balances at 31 December 2023** **170,083** **58,279**

The aforementioned deferred tax assets have been recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position
because the Parent's Directors are reasonably sure that they will be recovered, based on recent forecasts of the
future tax bases of the consolidated subsidiaries. In this regard, Antolin's current business plan for the coming
years revised by the Parent's Board of Directors and recently prepared by the Group's Directors envisages the
generation of pre-tax profits.

In 2023 an advance pricing arrangement (APA) was requested pursuant to Article 18.9 of Spanish Corporate
Income Tax Law 27/2014, of 27 November. For these purposes, the requested arrangement was performed at
arm’s length and in accordance with the procedure established in Article 21 et seq. of Royal Decree 634/2015, of
10 June, approving the Corporate Income Tax Regulations. That arrangement includes and accepts all the
elements of the proposal initially requested and the tax projections which served as a basis for the analysis of the
recognition and recoverability of the deferred tax assets include the impacts of the APA for 2024 and subsequent
years.

On 19 March 2024, the Spanish International Tax Office accepted the terms and conditions of the Advance Pricing
Arrangement requested by Antolin. This arrangement will be in force from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2027.

At 2023 year-end, the Group had not recognised deferred assets in the accompanying consolidated statement of
financial position in respect of certain tax loss carryforwards of consolidated subsidiaries (approximately 689
million euros), deductions pending application (totalling 56 million euros) or other temporary differences
(totalling 224 million euros), as it considers that their future recovery does not meet the requirements of
probability provided for in applicable accounting standards and/or in the application of the principle of prudence,
on the basis of the estimated tax projections aligned with the Group's business plans.

The deferred tax assets recognised in the consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2023 and
2022 were generated as follows:

**Tax credits-**

The corporate income tax legislation in force establishes various tax incentives. The tax credits earned in one
year in excess of the applicable legal limits may be deducted from the corporate income tax payable in subsequent
years, up to the limits and within the periods established in this connection by the related tax regulations. The
Group has availed itself of the tax benefits provided for by this legislation and deducted 8,632 and 5,820 thousand
euros, respectively, from the consolidated corporate income tax charge for 2023 and 2022, for which the Group
had not recorded any tax credits for those applied in 2023 and 2022.

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, after the aforementioned tax credits had been applied, certain foreign Group
companies had unused deductions amounting to approximately 10,806 and 11,740 thousand euros, respectively,
while the Group's Spanish subsidiaries had the following unused deductions:

**50,052** **44,752**

(a) At 31 December 2023, these corresponded to deductions for R&D activities from 2005 to 2023, inclusive, which
can be applied for 18 years from the year in which they were generated. These figures include an estimation of
the amount relating to deductions generated in 2023, because the final amount was still being calculated at the
date of authorisation for issue of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

(b) At 31 December 2022, these corresponded to deductions for R&D activities from 2004 to 2021, inclusive, which
can be applied for 18 years from the year in which they were generated. These figures do not include any
amounts relating to deductions generated in 2022, because the final amount was still being calculated at the
date of authorisation for issue of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

At 31 December 2023, Antolin had recognised a deferred tax asset of 4,553 thousand euros in relation to the
deductions pending application (no amount was recognised in 2022 for this concept).

**Years open for tax inspection-**

Under current legislation, tax settlements cannot be considered to be final until the tax returns filed have been
inspected by the tax authorities or until the statute-of-limitations period has expired (generally four or five years
in the countries in which the Group's companies are located). In this regard, on 17 April 2019 the Spanish
consolidated tax group to which the Parent and the majority of the Spanish consolidated subsidiaries belong filed
supplementary corporate income tax returns for 2016 and 2017.

Recently, on 18 January 2024, the Spanish Constitutional Court unanimously declared unconstitutional and null
and void the provisions envisaged in Additional Provision Fifteen and paragraph 3 of Additional Provision Sixteen
of Spanish Corporate Income Tax Law 27/2014, of 27 November, as amended by paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article
3.1 of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December, adopting tax measures aimed at consolidating public finances
and other urgent social measures. Specifically, it declared unconstitutional the introduction of stricter limitations
on the offsetting of tax loss carryforwards, the ex-novo introduction of a limitation on the application of double
taxation tax credits, and the requirement to automatically include in the corporate income tax base the
impairment losses on ownership interests that would have been deducted in prior years. In this regard, on 8 June
2021 and 17 November 2021, Avot Inversiones, S.L., as the head of the consolidated tax group in Spain, submitted
requests to rectify the corporate income tax returns filed for years 2016 to 2019 and 2020, respectively.

Although the Spanish consolidated tax group’s corporate income tax returns for 2016 to 2022 will be affected by
this ruling, at present it is not yet possible to determine with any certainty what the specific effects will be for
Antolin, considering in any event that the rectification requests should be accepted in full given that the provisions
on which the rectification requests are based are perfectly valid. Due to various factors concerning uncertainty
which prevent these effects from being determined from a quantitative point of view and make it impossible to
predict when they may be determined or when they will arise, no related deferred assets have been recognised.

Consequently, in Spain at 31 December 2023, the Group had 2020 through 2023, inclusive, open for inspection
by the tax authorities for all applicable taxes as well as 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for Corporate Income Tax as
a result of the rectification and amended returns filed.

The Parent's Directors believe that the settlements of those taxes have been properly executed and, therefore,
even if differences were to arise in the interpretation of the regulations governing the tax treatment of its
operations, such liabilities as could arise as a result of inspections in certain subsidiaries in relation to the
remaining years open for inspection would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements for
2023.

**The new international tax rules (Pillar Two)-**

The new top-up tax arising from the transposition of Pillar Two to Spanish legislation

As a large multinational group, Antolin is subject to the Pillar Two anti-base erosion model rules (also known
as the GloBE Rules) approved by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)/G20
Inclusive Framework on BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) on 14 December 2021 to which, among many
others, the EU Member States have adhered.

From 2024 onwards the Group must assume a payment corresponding to a top-up tax that will be levied on the
profits obtained in any jurisdiction in which it operates in which the effective tax rate, calculated at a jurisdictional
level, is lower than the minimum tax rate of 15%.

Pillar Two legislation is currently in the process of being approved in Spain and is expected to come into force at
the beginning of 2024 and will be applicable to Antolin for the first time in the reporting period commencing 1
January 2024 and, therefore, at 31 December 2023, the Group's corporate income tax expense for 2023 and,
accordingly, its consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 are not affected by the Pillar
Two rules.

Also, the Group applies the exception for recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and
liabilities related to Pillar Two corporate income taxes provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May
2023 (see Note 2-b).

Adaptation to the top-up tax

Antolin has explicitly undertaken to apply the OECD Pillar Two Model Rules. The Group is aligned with the
principles and actions advocated by the OECD and is working on an analysis of the impact of the new Pillar Two
in order to establish a compliance and control and management system that will permit it to adapt to the new
rules in due time and form.

In this regard, although the Group's analysis is still in progress, taking into account the existing regulatory
framework, an estimated calculation of the top-up tax arising from the application of Pillar Two was performed
on the basis of the most recent tax returns, the country-by-country report and the financial statements of the
constituent entities of the Group, and based on this calculation and subject to unforeseen events, the application
of the Model Rules is not expected to have a significant effect on equity, since in the jurisdictions in which the
Group operates the effective tax rate is at least 15% and/or the Group has sufficient employees and tangible assets
to trigger the substance-based income exclusion.

In this connection, it should be noted that the jurisdictions in which Antolin operates in which the effective tax
rate is below 15% are either not material jurisdictions and, therefore, the potential top-up tax that may arise is
not material or, although the average effective tax rate is below 15%, the Group considers that the new tax will
not have a material impact on the consolidated income statement applying the specific adjustments provided for
in the Pillar Two Model Rules and the Safe Harbour rules,

**Balances and transactions with related parties-**

In 2023 and 2022, the Group made purchases from CYLBUR, Compras y Logística Burgalesa, S.L. (a company
related to shareholders of Avot Inversiones, S.L. and affiliated with some of the Parent's Directors) for total
amounts of 3,964 and 3,180 thousand euros, approximately. These transactions were carried out in the normal
course of business of the Group and under market conditions. As a consequence of these transactions, at 31
December 2023 and 2022 the Group had payables to this related company totalling approximately 908 and 831
thousand euros, respectively.

Moreover, in 2023 purchases were made and services received from other companies related to the shareholders
of Avot Inversiones, S.L. totalling 632 thousand euros (551 thousand euros in 2022), and lease expenses paid to
other related companies were also recognised amounting to 232 thousand euros (186 thousand euros in 2022).

As a result of the operations carried out with these related companies, at 31 December 2023 the Group
recognised accounts payable to said companies amounting to 180 thousand euros (98 thousand euros at 31
December 2022).

Lastly, other transactions with parties and persons indirectly related to the Directors were performed in the
ordinary course of the Group's business. These were not however material and are not relevant for the purposes
of giving a true and fair view of the Group’s consolidated net assets, consolidated financial position and
consolidated results.

**(22)** **INFORMATION REGARDING THE PARENT'S DIRECTORS AND THE GROUP'S**
**CORE PERSONNEL**

**Parent Directors’ remuneration and other benefits-**

In 2023 and 2022 the members of the Parent's Board of Directors received 3,033 and 3,040 thousand euros,
respectively, in exchange for their administration tasks at the Parent. In addition, since certain members of the
Parent's Board of Directors are also employees thereof, in 2023 they accrued wages and salaries, termination
benefits and other benefits in this connection totalling 1,921 thousand euros (4,165 thousand euros in 2022).

In 2023 and 2022 the Parent's Directors did not receive any amount whatsoever for the rendering of services.

The sum of these amounts represents the total remuneration accrued by the Parent's Directors in 2023 and 2022,
for any cause or concept.

The Group has not assumed any obligation regarding pensions or life insurance for any current or past members
of the Parent's Board of Directors, although the Group paid D&O insurance premiums for the Parent's Directors
in 2023 totalling approximately 114 thousand euros (106 thousand euros in 2022).

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Parent had not granted any loans or advances to its Directors. Moreover, at
those dates the Parent had not provided any guarantees in their favour.


-----

In 2023 and 2022 no agreements between the Group and the shareholders of the Parent or persons acting on
their behalf were concluded, modified or terminated early, in relation to transactions outside the Group's ordinary
course of business or that would not have taken place under normal conditions. In those years no agreements
were executed between the Group and the Parent's Directors.

**Remuneration and other benefits of the Group's Senior**
**Management-**

Remuneration accrued by the Group's Senior Management (those members of the Management Committee that
are not Directors of the Parent) in 2023 totalled 3,146 thousand euros (4,528 thousand euros in 2022).

The Group has not entered into any pension commitments, nor has it granted any advances, loans or guarantees
to the members of the Group's senior management. The Group has approved “Multi-year remuneration plans”
for the Group's senior management for the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 periods. These plans are subject to certain
targets being met and the remuneration, if any, that is to be obtained is scheduled to be paid in the first few months
of the year following the end of each three-year period. The Group had not recognised any provision in relation
to these plans at 31 December 2023 because the established conditions were not being fulfilled and, therefore,
no liability had accrued at that date.

**Information regarding conflicts of interest involving the Parent’s Directors-**

Pursuant to Section 229 “Obligation to avoid conflicts of interest” of the Consolidated Text of the Spanish
Corporate Enterprise Act, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, of 2 July, amended on 4 December 2014,
it is hereby reported that there are no situations of direct or indirect conflict of interest involving the members
of the Parent's Board of Directors and individuals related to them and the companies composing the Group. In
this connection, transactions between the Group and companies related to certain directors are detailed in Note
21.

**(23)** **RISK POLICY AND MANAGEMENT**

**Financial risk factors-**

Antolin's activities are exposed to several financial risks: market risk (fair value risk and price risk), credit risk,
liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. Antolin's global risk management programme focuses on the
uncertainty of financial markets and seeks to minimise potentially adverse effects on the Group's profitability.
Antolin uses derivatives to hedge certain risks.

Risk management is controlled by the Group's Finance Department in accordance with the policies approved by
the Parent's Board of Directors. This Department identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's operating units. The Parent's Board of Directors provides policies for global risk
management, as well as for specific matters such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, the use of
derivatives and non-derivatives, and the investment of excess liquidity.

i) Commodity risk
The Group has no material exposure to commodity price fluctuations. In those companies in which this risk
may appear under specific market conditions (plants that use commodities with quoted prices), the risk is
managed through agreements to pass on the impact of financing commodity prices to customers on the basis
of the prevailing circumstances.


-----

ii) Credit risk
Antolin's customer portfolio is basically distributed among major car manufacturing groups, with a high credit
rating (see Note 20 on the percentage distribution of the Group's ordinary revenue based on the various car
manufacturers).

Each management unit maintains specific policies to manage this credit risk of its customers, which take into
consideration the financial position, past experience and other factors associated with its customers.

In addition, Antolin considers that the expected credit loss is negligible given the characteristics of the Group's
customers, since historically receivables have been collected in less than 60 days. The Group considers the
credit quality of these outstanding balances to be high, and understands that they have neither suffered
impairment nor are in arrears.

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, impairment of trade and other receivables totalled 5,836 and 5,717 thousand
euros, respectively, and past-due balances receivable from customers that are not provisioned are not
significant. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2023 and 2022 were the book
values.

The credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks
and financial institutions is considered immaterial given the credit quality of the banks with which the Group
operates. The credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits
with banks and financial institutions is considered immaterial, since these transactions are only executed with
financial institutions with a high credit rating. Antolin has policies to restrict the amount of risk with any
financial institution.

iii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of differences in the amounts or in the collection and payment dates of the
various assets and liabilities of Group companies.

Antolin exercises prudent management of liquidity risk based on the maintenance of sufficient cash and
marketable securities, the availability of financing by means of a sufficient amount of committed credit facilities
and sufficient capacity to settle market positions. In addition, the Group's centralised treasury operations allow
it to manage financial resources more efficiently. Given the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the
goal of the Group's Finance Department is to maintain flexible financing, through the availability of contracted
credit facilities or factoring lines with or without recourse (through which it transfers its receivables to third
parties).

At 31 December 2023, the Group had a solid financial situation and had recognised positive working capital
totalling 181,781 thousand euros.

The Group's liquidity position in 2023 is based on its strong capacity to generate operating cash flows,
supported by the maintenance of undrawn credit and revolving credit facilities. At 31 December 2023, the
undrawn amount of the credit and revolving credit facilities amounted to 194,179 thousand euros. The Group's
liquidity position guarantees that it will be able to meet operating cash needs and debt maturities in 2024,
amounting to 173,555 thousand euros (see Note 17), as well as any adverse financial market situations that
might arise in the coming months.

Group Management monitors cash requirements as well as the evolution of its debt ratio. In this regard, Group
Management considers that any liquidity constraints that may arise in the short term will be covered by the
financial resources currently available, the resources generated by the Group in its activities (as indicated in
the cash budget for 2024) and/or any future financing that may be arranged.


-----

iv) Cash flow interest rate risk and fair value risk
Given that the Group does not have any significant amounts of interest-earning assets, its operating revenues
and cash flows are largely unaffected by the variations in market interest rates.

The Group's interest rate risk stems from its non-current borrowings. The Group's variable rate borrowings
expose it to cash flows interest rate risks. The Group's fixed rate borrowings expose it to fair value interest
rate risks. At the end of the 2023 reporting period, approximately 60% of borrowings were at fixed interest
rates (if non-recourse factoring is also taken into account, this ratio is 52%).

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, the Group had no derivative instruments contracted to cover its exposure
to variable interest rates. Taking into account the contractual terms of the funding in force at that date, it was
estimated that a 0.50% change in interest rates would lead to a fluctuation of approximately 3 million euros
in interest expenses.

v) Foreign-exchange risk
The international expansion of the Group and its ever-growing volume of business outside the euro zone
expose it, principally, to exchange rate risks in currencies such as the Czech koruna, the Brazilian real, the US
dollar, the Mexican peso, the Pound sterling and the Chinese yuan, which could have an impact on its results.
To reduce its exposure to this risk, the Group avails itself of a variety of mechanisms, such as using local
suppliers and negotiating with customers and suppliers to hedge against major movements in currencies.
Antolin has not entered into any foreign-exchange hedge or foreign-currency forward agreements.

The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis of the key figures in its budgeted income statement for 2024,
and has concluded that a 5% rise in the euro against currencies such as the Czech koruna, the Brazilian real,
the US dollar, the Mexican peso, the Pound sterling and the Chinese yuan would reduce revenue by
approximately 128 million euros (approximately 3% of the amount budgeted), and budgeted consolidated net
turnover for 2024 (before tax) would fall by approximately 8.5 million euros.

**Other risk factors-**

The activities of Antolin are also exposed to other risks that could impact on the economic growth or the business
activity of the markets in which it operates. Antolin’s global risk management programme is also focused on the
uncertainty of these other risks and seeks to minimise any adverse effects on the Group's profitability. The Parent’s
Board of Directors provides policies for global risk management in close co-operation with the business units.

i) Effect of the Russia-Ukraine war
The military conflict arising from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the associated financial sanctions continue
to pose a threat to the recovery scenario of the world's production of light vehicles in 2023. In addition, the
negative economic impact of the war in Ukraine is coupled with ongoing risks on the supply side in connection
with a shortage of semi-conductors, high and volatile gas and electricity prices, a situation of generalised
inflation tied to the other production factors and significant and rapid interest rate hikes in the United States
and, to an even greater extent, in Europe.

The consensus forecasts estimate that, as a result of the direct and indirect impacts of the Russian invasion,
global vehicle production has been adversely affected, with the indirect impacts being particularly pronounced
in Europe. In 2022, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Russia progressively suspended their
production activities in that country and have not been able to normalise their operations in that market since
then.

As regards Antolin, the direct impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine affected its two factories in
Russia (St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod), which represented 0.17% of Antolin’s turnover in 2022.


-----

In this regard, and given the uncertainty surrounding the Group's activities in Russia, in 2022 the Group decided
to discontinue its operations in that country and initiate a process for the sale of the related business, which
was completed in March 2023 (see Note 25). In the consolidated financial statements for 2022 the Group
recognised the results of this business as “discontinued operations”, reporting a loss of approximately 26
million euros under “Profit/(loss) for the year from discontinued operations, net of tax” in the accompanying
consolidated income statement (see Note 25).

ii) Climate change
Through its activities, Antolin wishes to comply with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable
Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.

Antolin incorporates issues related to climate change and environmental issues in its risk catalogue, explicitly
in four of the risks included in the corporate catalogue: "Environmental risk", "Risk of non-compliance with
environmental legislation", "Risk of incidents in the environmental management of production" (including
waste management) and "Risk of climate change".

“Environmental risk” relates to the absence or inadequate definition of a business contingency plan that covers
both preventive management and recovery of activity in situations caused by serious accidents and/or natural
disasters. In short, it takes into consideration extreme weather events that may significantly affect its operations
and facilities.

Both the risk of "Non-compliance with environmental legislation" and the risk of "Incidents in the
environmental management of production" (understood as the occurrence of accidents with environmental
impact) refer to the penalties that may be incurred as well as the reputational damage derived from such
incidents.

In the case of "Climate Change" risk, reference is made to the negative impact of climate change and its
consequences in relation to meeting the Company's strategic objectives.

Antolin adopts and applies the main conventions and guidelines established in the Global Compact (Principles
7, 8 and 9) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP Water Disclosure Project) and has resolved to
progressively reduce its carbon emissions in order to achieve neutrality by 2040 in its own operations, with
an intermediate 75% (previously established at 30%) reduction by 2028, and wishes to extend this
environmental commitment to its entire supply chain in order to achieve total carbon neutrality by 2050.

**(24)** **OTHER INFORMATION**

**Guarantees given to third parties and other contingent liabilities-**

At 31 December 2023 and 2022, various financial institutions had also provided guarantees to public bodies on
the Group's behalf to guarantee compliance with the general and particular terms of certain capital and operating
grants made to the Group (see Note 15), and the repayment of a number of loans granted by public authorities
to fund research and development projects (see Note 17).

The Parent’s Directors do not expect any liabilities not foreseen at 31 December 2023 or any significant losses
to arise for the Group as a result of the guarantees given.

**Other current liabilities-**

The balance recorded under this heading in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31
December 2023 corresponds mainly to outstanding remuneration to personnel, to accruals recorded to match
revenues to expenses and to record operations on an accrual basis.

**Fees paid to the auditors-**

The fees for audit and other services provided during 2023 and 2022 by the Group's main auditor, KPMG
Auditores, S.L., or by companies related to them through control, joint ownership interests or management,

**Disclosure on the average payment period to suppliers in**
**Spain-**

This note contains the information required in accordance with Additional Provision Three of Law 15/2010, of 5
July, modifying Law 3/2004, of 29 December, establishing measures to combat late payment in commercial
transactions (amended by the Final Provision Two of Law 31/2015, of 3 December), prepared in compliance with
the Resolution issued on 29 January 2016 by the Institute of Accounting and Account Auditing (ICAC) on the
disclosures required in the notes to the financial statements with regard to the average payment period to trade
suppliers and service providers. Trade payables are understood to include amounts payable for the supply of
goods or services (not including non-current asset suppliers).

For the purposes of preparing this information, and given the nature of the Group's activities and operations, the
“payment period” is treated as the period between the invoice date (which in practice is generally on or close to
the date the goods and services are received from the supplier) and the payment date.

In accordance with the above, the information required under this legislation for the financial years ended 31
December 2023 and 2022 for payments made by the Group's Spanish companies is as follows:

2023 2022
Days (a) Days (a)

Average payment period to suppliers 55.38 47.71
Transactions paid ratio 55.11 48.44

Total payments made 323,229 484,155

(a) In accordance with Law 11/2013, of 26 July, establishing measures to support entrepreneurs and
stimulate growth and the creation of jobs, amending Law 3/2004, the maximum legal payment
period is 30 days, which may be extended to up to 60 days with the agreement of both parties.

The information for 2023 relating to invoices paid by the Spanish Group companies in a shorter period of time
than the period established in the late-payment legislation is as follows: a total of 33,415 invoices (representing
65% of the total invoices paid in 2023), involving a total amount of 212,493 thousand euros (66% of the total
amount paid in 2023).

Also, the information for 2022 relating to invoices paid by the Spanish Group companies in a shorter period of
time than the period established in the late-payment legislation was as follows: a total of 36,950 invoices
(representing 72% of the total invoices paid in 2022), involving a total amount of 387,268 thousand euros (80% of
the total amount paid in 2022).

**Environmental information-**

Antolin's environmental activities focus on two general areas:

    Environmental Management System. Based on manuals and procedures common to all the centres defining
the measures to ensure strict compliance with current legislation, the rational use of resources and energy
and minimising the generation of waste.

    Environment-Sensitive Design. Through its research and development centres, the Group designs its products
with a view to minimising the environmental impact of the vehicle over its useful life.

The Group's property, plant and equipment includes certain investments the net book value of which at 31
December 2023 and 2022 totalled approximately 418 and 526 thousand euros, respectively, its purpose being to
reduce the environmental impact of the Group's activity and to protect and enhance the environment. In 2023
and 2022 the Group also incurred certain expenses aimed at protecting and enhancing the environment, totalling
approximately 6,900 and 5,674 thousand euros, respectively.

Antolin has no other environmental liabilities, provisions or contingencies that could have a significant impact on
its equity, financial position or results (see Note 16).

In particular, as regards greenhouse gas emissions allowances for no consideration, given the nature of their
activity, the facilities of the Spanish consolidated companies were not included in the scope of Law 1/2005, of 9
March, regulating the allocation of greenhouse gas emissions allowances and, therefore, these Spanish companies
have been allotted no greenhouse effect gas emission rights for the 2021-2025 period (Phase IV). No greenhouse
gas emissions rights have therefore been recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31
December 2023, no movements occurred under this heading in 2023 and no impairment losses were recognised
in relation thereto. Furthermore, in 2023 Antolin incurred no expenses and recognised no provisions in
connection with this item. The Group has not entered into any futures contracts relating to emission rights, has
received no grants associated with such rights and has recognised no contingencies arising from greenhouse gas
emissions rights.

**(25)** **DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

As indicated in Notes 2-g, 3-f, 3-p and 6, in 2022, and with accounting effect from 1 January 2022, the Group
decided to discontinue its operations in the Russian geographical segment, and the sale process initiated was
completed in March 2023. This activity was classified as a “discontinued operation” in the consolidated financial
statements for 2022.

The detail of the measurement of the assets and liabilities associated with this geographical segment at 31
December 2022 is as follows:


-----

## Independent Auditor's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements

_(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)_

To the Sole Shareholder of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U.

##### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

#### Opinion 

We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. (the
“Parent”) and subsidiaries (together the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of
financial position at 31 December 2022, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all
material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group at 31
December 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the
year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the
European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in
Spain.

#### Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in
Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's
_Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._

We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those
regarding independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements
pursuant to the legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. We have not provided any nonaudit services, nor have any situations or circumstances arisen which, under the aforementioned
regulations, have affected the required independence such that this has been compromised.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis
for our opinion.


-----

#### Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance
in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were
addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in
forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

|Recoverable amount of non-current assets See notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2|
|---|---|
|Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|At 31 December 2022 the Group has intangible assets with a carrying amount of Euros 319,006 thousand, property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of Euros 644,204 thousand and goodwill with a carrying amount of Euros 90,206 thousand allocated to the pertinent cash-generating units. At 31 December 2022 impairment of Euros 138,042 thousand has been recognised on intangible assets and Euros 62,683 on property, plant and equipment, of which Euros 85,025 thousand and Euros 59,547 thousand, respectively, were recognised in 2022. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of goodwill annually and tests property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for indications of impairment, for the purposes of determining their recoverable amount. The Group has calculated the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for which it has identified indications of impairment by applying valuation techniques that require the exercising of judgement and the use of assumptions by management and the Directors. Due to the high level of judgement and the uncertainty associated with these assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, their measurement has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Assessing the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of estimating the recoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets. - Assessing the criteria used by the Directors and Group management when identifying indications of impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill. - Evaluating the methodology and assumptions used by management and the Directors to estimate the recoverable amount applying the discounted cash flow method at cash-generating unit level, with the involvement of our valuation specialists. - Comparing the cash flow forecasts estimated in prior years with the actual cash flows obtained. - Contrasting the information contained in the model used to calculate the recoverable amount with the Group's business plans approved by management. - Analysing the sensitivity of the estimated recoverable amount to changes in the relevant assumptions and judgements, such as the discount rate and the expected future growth rate used to estimate future cash flows. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.|


-----

|Capitalisation of development expenses See note 7 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2|
|---|---|
|Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit|
|In 2022 the Group capitalised development expenses amounting to Euros 84,786 thousand and at 31 December 2022 the Group has capitalised total development expenses of Euros 265,124 thousand under other intangible assets. The capitalisation of development expenses requires an analysis of compliance with the requirements laid down in the financial reporting framework. If there are reasonable doubts as to the technical success or economic-financial feasibility of the projects, the amounts recognised as assets should be taken directly to the consolidated income statement, and therefore there is a risk that the capitalised costs would not meet the criteria set forth in the financial reporting framework for their capitalisation. Due to the judgement associated with the foregoing assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, capitalisation of such costs as development expenses has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Evaluating the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of recognising development expenses and identifying, where applicable, the expenses that qualify for capitalisation. - Performing tests of detail for a sample of capitalised development expenses, corroborating the amounts capitalised and analysing the supporting documentation prepared by management and which substantiates the technical success and economic-financial feasibility of the projects, assessing the reasonableness of the main assumptions considered. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the reporting requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.|


#### Other Information: Consolidated Directors’ Report 

Other information solely comprises the 2022 consolidated directors' report, the preparation of which
is the responsibility of the Parent's Directors and which does not form an integral part of the
consolidated financial statements.

Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not encompass the consolidated
directors' report. Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated directors’
report is defined in the legislation regulating the audit of accounts, as follows:

a) Determine, solely, whether the consolidated non-financial information statement has been
provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, and if not, to report on this matter.

b) Assess and report on the consistency of the rest of the information included in the consolidated
directors’ report with the consolidated financial statements, based on knowledge of the Group
obtained during the audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements. Also, assess
and report on whether the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated directors’
report are in accordance with applicable legislation. If, based on the work we have performed,
we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report them.


-----

Based on the work carried out, as described above, we have observed that the information
mentioned in section a) above has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable
legislation, that the rest of the information contained in the consolidated directors’ report is
consistent with that disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for 2022, and that the
content and presentation of the report are in accordance with applicable legislation.

#### Directors' and Audit Committee's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements 

The Parent's Directors are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated
financial statements in such a way that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity,
consolidated financial position and consolidated financial performance of the Group in accordance
with IFRS-EU and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in
Spain, and for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of
consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's Directors are responsible for
assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters
related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors
either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do
so.

The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the preparation and presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

#### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements______________________________________________________________  

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to
issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain will always detect a
material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial
statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain,
we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We
also:

#### – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,
and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The
risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting
from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or
the override of internal control.


-----

#### – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.

#### – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent's Directors.

#### – Conclude on the appropriateness of the Parent's Directors' use of the going concern basis
of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to
continue as a going concern.

#### – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair
view.

#### – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or
business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial
statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group
audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with the audit committee of the Parent regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide the Parent's audit committee with a statement that we have complied with the
applicable ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and to communicate with
them all matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where
applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated to the audit committee of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U., we
determine those that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial
statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter.

##### REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

#### Additional Report to the Audit Committee of the Parent  

The opinion expressed in this report is consistent with our additional report to the audit committee
of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. dated 25 April 2023.

#### Contract Period  

We were appointed as auditor of the Group by the sole shareholder on 20 July 2021 for a period of
three years, beginning the year ended 31 December 2021.

**Associates and joint ventures-**

_“Associates” are defined as companies over which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence._

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but
is not control or joint control of those policies.

IFRS 11 defines a joint venture (as opposed to a joint operation as described in the next section of this Note) as a
joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (“joint venturers”) have rights
to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed upon sharing of control of an
arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the
parties sharing control.

The Group's holdings in associates and joint ventures (accounted for in consolidated annual financial statements
_for 2022 and 2021 using the “equity method”), and the corresponding book values recognised under “Investments_
in companies accounted for using the equity method” in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31

(a) In July 2020, the Group acquired a 49% equity stake in Matoma Capital, S.L. (now AED Innovation Group, S.L.) for 4,477 thousand euros.

This company is the parent of a group comprising AED Engineering, GmbH and AED Embedded Development, S.L.U., wholly owned by
AED Innovation Group, S.L. and located in Munich (Germany) and Murcia (Spain), respectively. The Group had a commitment to make
future capital contributions to this investee amounting to an additional 3,775 thousand euros between 2021 and 2022, having made the
aforementioned contributions at 31 December 2022 (1,887 thousand euros each year).

(b) International Door Company, B.V. (in which the Group has a 50% stake) has a 100% equity interest in Slovakian Door Company, s.r.o.

Therefore, at 31 December 2022 and 2021 the Group indirectly held 50% of the share capital of this company, which is classified as an
“associate”.

(c) At 31 December 2021 the Group owned 49% of Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan) Automotive Trim Co., Ltd. In 2022 the Group acquired an

additional 51% stake in the share capital from another shareholder of this company. As a result of this operation, at 31 December 2022
the Group owned 100% of the share capital of Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan) Automotive Trim Co, Ltd. which is now considered a subsidiary
company and, in consequence, is fully consolidated.

**(2)** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED ANNUAL FINANCIAL**
**STATEMENTS AND CONSOLIDATION STANDARDS**

**_a)_** **_True and fair view-_**

In accordance with Final Provision Eleven of Law 62/2003 on Tax, Administrative and Social Order Measures,
of 30 December, companies with holdings are required to draw up consolidated annual financial statements
and directors' reports. At year-end none of the companies in the Group had issued shares that are listed on
an official market of any member State of the European Union. They may therefore opt to present their
consolidated annual financial statements for the years beginning from 1 January 2005 in accordance with
Spanish accounting standards or in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted
by the European Union. Accordingly, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. decided to apply voluntarily, for the first
time in the financial year 2007, said International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European
Union when drawing up its consolidated annual financial statements.

The consolidated annual financial statements for 2022, which were prepared from the individual accounting
records of the Parent and of the companies included in consolidation _(listed in Note 1), are presented in_
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the European Union (hereinafter
_referred to as "IFRS-EU") and, accordingly, give a true and fair view of the Group's consolidated net worth,_
consolidated financial position at 31 December 2022, results of operations, and changes in consolidated
equity and cash flows arising in the year then ended.

These consolidated annual financial statements for 2022 have been authorised for issue by the Parent's
Directors and will be submitted to the Parent's Sole Shareholder for approval.

The consolidated annual financial statements for 2021 were approved by the Parent's Sole Shareholder on 28
June 2022.

**_b)_** **_Adopting new standards and interpretations issued-_**

Grupo Antolin's consolidated annual financial statements for the financial years to 31 December 2022 were
drawn up in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, in accordance with the terms of
Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council dated 19 July 2002, taking into
account all mandatory accounting principles, standards and measurement bases with a material impact and
the alternatives permitted under the standards in this respect.


_Standards and interpretations in force in 2022_


The consolidated annual financial statements were prepared in keeping with the IFRS-EU and consider the
rules, amendments and interpretations adopted by the European Union with entry into force at 1 January
2022, without any significant effects on the Group's consolidated financial statements:

Also, certain clarifications are introduced in relation to the recognition of contingent assets and liabilities. The amendment prohibits deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while the entity is bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use. The proceeds from the sale of samples, together with the related production costs, must be recognised in profit or loss. The amendment explains that the cost of fulfilling a contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling the contract.

-----

The Group is beginning to assess the potential impact of the future application of these standards and, after
a first analysis, estimates that these will not have a significant impact on the Group's consolidated financial
statements.

**_c)_** **_Functional currency-_**

The consolidated annual financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, which is the Parent's
functional and presentation currency, rounded off to the nearest thousand. Foreign operations are recorded
in accordance with the policies described in Notes 2-f and 3-l.

**_d)_** **_Comparative information-_**

In accordance with the requirements of IAS 1, the information set out in these notes to consolidated financial
statements relating to 2022 is presented, for the purposes of comparison, with the figures for 2021.

There have been no major changes in the accounting policies that affect 2022 and 2021. However, in 2022
Grupo Antolin’s business activities in Russia were presented as discontinued business operations. Neither
have any corrections of errors relating to prior years been made, nor have any major changes been made in
the accounting estimates that affect these financial years or that are likely to affect future financial years.

**_e)_** **_Responsibility for the information provided and estimates_**
**_made-_**

The information set out in these consolidated annual financial statements for 2022 is the responsibility of the
Directors of the Parent.

The consolidated results and the calculation of consolidated net assets are sensitive to the accounting
principles, policies, measurement criteria and estimates used by the Parent's Directors in the preparation of
the consolidated annual financial statements. The main accounting principles and policies and measurement
criteria used are disclosed in Note 3.

In preparing the consolidated annual financial statements for 2022, estimates made by the Group's Senior
Management _(subsequently ratified by the Parent's Directors) were used on occasion to measure certain_
assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments recognised in them and that could have a significant
impact over the next twelve months. These estimates, made based on the best information available, refer
to:

    - The assessment of signs of impairment losses in PPE and calculation of its recoverable value (Note 8).
    - The assessment of the technical success of the projects and their profitability (Note 7).
    - The measurement of goodwill (Note 7).
    - Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 19).
    - The capacity to exercise control over some consolidated companies and the timing thereof (Note 1).

Although these estimates were made based on the best information available at 31 December 2022 for the
events being analysed, future events may make it necessary to revise these estimates _(upwards or_
_downwards) in coming years. Any such changes would be applied prospectively, and the effects of the change_
in estimate would be taken to the consolidated income statement in the years affected, as provided for in IAS
8.

**_f)_** **_Consolidation standards-_**

_Subsidiaries-_

Subsidiaries, including structured entities, are those over which the Parent exercises control directly, or
i di tl i b idi i Th P t t l b idi h th h it i l t it i d h


-----

substantive rights in force that enable it to direct relevant activities. The Parent is exposed, or has the right,
to variable returns for its involvement in the subsidiary when the returns it obtains through that involvement
may change based on the entity's economic performance.

A structured entity is one that is designed so that voting and similar rights are not essential when determining
who controls the entity, e.g. in the event that possible voting rights refer exclusively to administrative
activities and these are governed by contractual agreements.

Subsidiary revenues, expenses and cash flows are included in the consolidated annual financial statements as
of the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Group effectively obtains control over them.
Subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation as of the date on which that control is lost.

The transactions and balances with Group companies and unrealised profits or losses have been eliminated
in the consolidation process. However, unrealised losses were considered as a sign of impaired value of the
transferred assets.

Subsidiary accounting policies have been adapted to the Group's accounting policies, for transactions and
other events that are similar and occurred under similar circumstances.

The annual financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the consolidation process refer to the same
reporting date and period as those of the Company.

The individual annual financial statements of _“subsidiaries” have been fully consolidated with those of the_
Parent.

_Business combinations-_

The Group applies the acquisition method in business combinations.

The acquisition date is the one on which the Group obtains control over the business acquired.

The consideration delivered for the business combination is determined on the acquisition date by the sum
of the fair values of the assets delivered, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued
and any contingent consideration dependent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions in
exchange for the control over the business acquired.

The consideration delivered excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the business
acquired. Costs relating to the acquisition are recognised as an expense when they are incurred.

On the acquisition date the Group recognises the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed (and any other non_controlling interest) at their fair value. The non-controlling interest in the business acquired is recognised at_
the amount corresponding to the percentage in the fair value of the net assets acquired. This criterion solely
applies to non-controlling interests that grant present access to financial profits and the right to the
proportional part of the acquired entity's net assets in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling
interests are recognised at fair value or at the value based on market conditions. The liabilities assumed
include contingent liabilities insofar as they represent present obligations arising from past events whose fair
value may be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets allocated by the seller at
the same time and following the same measurement criteria for the indemnification item of the acquired
business, considering the risk of insolvency and any contractual restriction on the indemnified amount, as
appropriate.

The application of this criterion excludes non-current assets or disposable groups of elements classified as
held for sale, liabilities for long-term defined benefits, transactions with payments based on equity
instruments, deferred tax assets and liabilities and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of previously
granted rights.


-----

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are classified and designated for subsequent recognition on the
basis of contractual agreements, financial conditions, accounting and operating policies and other conditions
existing on the acquisition date, with the exception of leases in which the business acquired is the landlord
and insurance.

Any excess existing between the consideration provided plus the value assigned to the non-controlling
interests and the net amount of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In
relation to any deficiency existing after assessing the amount of the consideration provided, the value
assigned to the non-controlling interests and the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired
are recognised as a separate item in the consolidated income statement.

_Non-controlling interests-_

Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired as of 1 January 2004 are recorded on the acquisition
date by the percentage held in the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in the
subsidiaries acquired before the transition date were recognised by the percentage in equity on the date of
first-time consolidation.

Non-controlling interests are presented in consolidated net equity separately from the equity attributed to
the Parent's shareholders. Non-controlling interests in consolidated profit/(loss) for the year _(and in other_
_consolidated comprehensive income for the year) are also presented for the year separately in the_
consolidated income statement (consolidated comprehensive income statement).

The Group's interest and the non-controlling interests in the consolidated profit/(loss) for the year
_(consolidated comprehensive income for the year) and in changes in net equity of the subsidiaries, after_
considering adjustments and eliminations arising from consolidation, are determined from ownership
interests at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and
after deducting the effect of dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights
classified in net equity accounts. However, the Group's interest and the non-controlling interests are
determined considering the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other financial derivatives, that
essentially grant current access to the returns associated with subsidiary ownership.

Any excess losses attributable to non-controlling interests generated prior to 1 January 2010, not attributable
to these because they exceed the amount of interest in the subsidiary's equity, are recorded as a decrease in
net equity attributable to Parent shareholders, except in those cases in which the non-controlling interests
have a binding obligation to assume all or part of the losses and have the ability to make the necessary
additional investment. The profits obtained in subsequent years are assigned to the net equity attributable
to Parent shareholders, until the recovery of the amount of the losses absorbed in prior reporting periods
that correspond to non-controlling interests.

As of 1 January 2010, the profit/(loss) and each component of other comprehensive income are assigned to
the net equity attributable to Parent shareholders and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their
interest, even if this entails a deficit balance of non-controlling interests. The agreements executed between
the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction.

_Associates-_

Associates are those entities over which the Company exercises significant influence, directly or indirectly via
subsidiaries. Significant influence is the power to participate in an entity's financial and operating policy
decisions, without the existence of control or joint control. In determining the existence of significant
influence, potential voting rights are considered, whether exercisable or convertible on the closing date of
each year, and likewise considering any potential voting rights held by the Group or another entity.

Investments in associates are recorded by the equity method from the date on which the significant influence
is exercised to the date on which the Company is unable to continue to justify its existence. Nevertheless, if
on the acquisition date all or part of the investment complies with the conditions for classification as non

-----

current assets or disposable groups of elements held for sale, it will be recorded at fair value less any costs of
sale or disposal by other means.

Investments in associates are initially recognised at their acquisition cost, additionally including any additional
cost directly attributable to the acquisition and any contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability
that depends on future events or on the fulfilment of certain conditions.

The excess between the investment cost and the percentage corresponding to the Group in the fair values of
the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill, which is included in the investment's book value. Any
deficiency, after measuring the amounts of the investment cost and identification and assessment of the
associate's net assets, is recorded as revenue in determining the investor's interest in the associate's
profit/(loss) for the year of its acquisition.

If the investment results in the loss of control of a subsidiary that does not constitute a business, the cost of
the investment is the fair value, net of any eliminations from the results of the loss of control.

The accounting policies of associates were subject to timing and measurement unification in the same terms
as those referenced for subsidiaries.

The Group's interest in profits or losses of associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an
increase or decrease in the value of the investments with a credit or debit to Equity Participation in
profit/(loss) for the year, recorded by applying the equity method of the consolidated income statement
_(consolidated comprehensive income statement). Likewise, the Group's interest in profits or losses of_
associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an increase or decrease in the value of the
investments in the associates, recognising the itemised consideration in other comprehensive income.
Dividend distributions are recorded as decreases in the investment values. The Group's interest in profits or
losses, including impairment losses recognised by the associates, will consider revenue or expenses deriving
from the acquisition method.

The Group's interest in profits or losses of the associates and in changes to net equity is determined on the
basis of its ownership interest at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of
potential voting rights. However, the Group's interest is determined considering the possible exercise of
potential voting rights and other financial derivatives that essentially grant current access to the returns
relating to associate ownership interest.

The Group's interest in profits or losses of the associates is recorded after considering the effect of the
dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights classified in net equity accounts.

The losses in associates that correspond to the Group are limited to the net investment value, except in those
cases in which the Group has assumed legal or implicit obligations, or has made payments on behalf of the
associates. To recognise impairment losses in associates, the net investment is considered as the result of
adding the book value resulting from the application of the equity method to the one that corresponds to any
other item that essentially forms part of the investment in the associates. Any excess of losses on the
investment in equity instruments is applied to the rest of the items in reverse order of priority on liquidation.
The profits subsequently obtained by those associates in which recognition of losses is limited to the value of
the investment are recorded to the extent that they exceed any losses not previously recognised. The Group
applies financial instrument measurement criteria to the other items that form part of the net investment
and to which the equity method is not applied, prior to recognising the aforementioned losses. In applying
those criteria, the Group does not consider the recognition of losses deriving from the equity method in the
book value of these items. As a result of this, the measurement criteria of those items at fair value and value
impairment, where appropriate, change the recognition of the items deriving from the equity method in prior
periods and the year underway.

Profits and losses not realised in transactions performed between the Group and associates are only
recognised to the extent that they correspond to unrelated investors' interests The recognition of unrealised


-----

criterion. However, profits and losses deriving from transactions between the Group and associates of net
assets that constitute a business will be recognised in their entirety.

Unrealised profits or losses of non-monetary contributions of assets to associates that do not constitute a
Group business are recorded in keeping with the value of the transactions. In this regard, if the transferred
assets remain in the associate and the transaction is commercial in nature, only the proportional part of the
profits or losses that correspond to the rest of the investors is recognised. Otherwise, no profit/(loss) is
recognised for the transaction. Deferred profit/(loss) is recognised against the value of the interest.
Furthermore, unrealised losses are eliminated insofar as they do not constitute proof of impairment of the
transferred asset. If in the non-monetary contribution and in addition to the interest, the Group receives
monetary or non-monetary assets, the profit/(loss) of the transaction corresponding to the latter is
recognised.

In non-monetary contributions of Group businesses to associates, profits and losses are recognised in their
entirety.

The Group applies the criteria indicated in the financial instrument accounting policy, including any
impairment adjustments to the other financial instruments to which the equity method is not applied,
including those that form part of the net investment in the associate.

The recognition of losses from applying the equity method or impairment of the financial instruments that
form part of the net investment in the associate are not considered in applying the measurement criteria
indicated in the financial instrument policy.

Once the equity method is applied, the Group assesses whether objective evidence of net impairment exists
in the associate.

Calculation of impairment is determined as a result of the comparison of the book value relating to the net
investment in the associate with its recoverable value, with recoverable value deemed to be the greater of
the value in use or fair value less costs to sell or of disposal by other means. In this connection, the value in
use is calculated on the basis of the Group's interest in the present value of the estimated cash flows from
ordinary activities and from any amounts that could result from the final sale of the associate.

The recoverable amount of the investment in an associate is measured with regard to each associate, unless
it is not a cash generating unit (CGU).

The impairment loss is not assigned to goodwill or to other implicit assets in the investment in associates
deriving from the application of the acquisition method. In subsequent years value reversals of investments
are recognised against profit/(loss), to the extent that an increase in recoverable value exists. Impairment loss
is presented separately from the Group's interest in associate profit/(loss).

_Joint agreements-_

Joint agreements are considered to be those in which a contractual agreement exists to share control over an
economic activity, so that any decisions on relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group
and the rest of the investors or operators. The assessment of the existence of joint control takes place by
considering the subsidiaries' definition of control.

_i)_ _Joint operations_

In joint operations, the Group recognises its assets in the consolidated annual financial statements,
including its interest in jointly-controlled assets; its liabilities, including its interest in any liabilities
incurred jointly with other operators; the revenue obtained from the sale of its part of the production
deriving from the joint operation, its part of revenue obtained from the sale of the production deriving
from the joint operation, its expenses, including the part of the joint expenses that corresponds to it.


-----

The Group's acquisition of the initial and subsequent interest in a joint operation constituting a business
is recognised by applying the criteria for business combinations as the percentage interest it holds in the
individual assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, in the subsequent acquisition of additional interest in a joint
operation, the prior interest in the individual assets and liabilities is not subject to revaluation, insofar as
the Group maintains joint control.

In sale or contribution transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit/(loss) corresponding
to the interest of the rest of the operators is recognised, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or
impairment of the assets transferred, in which case they are recognised in their entirety.

In purchase or contribution transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit/(loss) is
recognised when the assets acquired are sold to third parties, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or
impairment of the assets acquired, in which case the Group recognises the proportional part of any losses
that correspond to it in their entirety.

_Transactions and balances in foreign currency-_

_i)_ _Functional and presentation currency_

The consolidated annual financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, which is the Parent's
functional and presentation currency, rounded off to the nearest thousand.

_ii)_ _Transactions, balances and cash flows in foreign currency_

Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency by applying the spot exchange
rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency on the dates on which the transactions
take place.

Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into euros by applying the existing rate
at year-end, while non-monetary ones measured at historical cost are translated by applying the
exchange rights applied on the date on which the transaction took place. For these purposes, supplier
and customer advances are considered non-monetary items, whereby they are translated at the
exchange rate on the date on which the payment or collection took place. The subsequent posting of the
reception of inventories or revenue from sales, for the part of the advance, takes place at the original
exchange rate and not the one on the transaction date. Finally, the translation into euros of nonmonetary assets measured at fair value is performed by applying the exchange rate on the date of their
quantification.

In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statement, flows from foreign currency transactions
are translated into euros by applying exchange rates existing on the date on which they took place. The
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are presented
separately in the cash flow statement as “Effect of exchange rate differences on cash”.

The differences revealed in the settlement of transactions in foreign currency and in the translation into
euros of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are recognised in profit/(loss). However, the
exchange differences arising in monetary items that form part of the net business investment abroad are
recorded as translation differences in other comprehensive income.

Exchange gains or losses relating to monetary financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign
currency are also recognised in profit/(loss).

Monetary financial assets denominated in foreign currency classified at fair value with changes in other
comprehensive income, are considered to be posted at amortised cost in the foreign currency and,
therefore, the exchange differences associated with any changes in amortised cost are recognised in
profit/(loss) and the rest of the change in fair value is recognised as set out in section i).


-----

The Group presents the effect of the translation of deferred tax assets and liabilities denominated in
foreign currency jointly with the deferred income tax in profit/(loss).

Exchange gains or losses of non-monetary financial assets and liabilities and monetary financial assets
and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), are recognised jointly with a change in
the fair value in other comprehensive income or in profit/(loss). The rest of the change in fair value is
recognised as set out in section i). Nevertheless, the component of the change to the exchange rate of
equity instruments denominated in foreign currency and measured at fair value with changes in other
comprehensive income and classified as fair value hedges of that component, is recognised in other
comprehensive income.

_iii)_ _Translation of foreign businesses_

The Group availed itself of the exemption in IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial
Reporting Standards”, regarding cumulative translation differences, whereby the translation differences
recognised in the consolidated annual financial statements generated prior to 1 January 2004 were
included in reserves for cumulative gains. As of that date, the translation into euros of foreign businesses
whose functional currency is not from a hyper-inflationary country was performed by the application of
the following criteria:

    - Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and adjustments to net assets deriving from business
acquisition, including comparative balances, are translated at the closing rate on the date of each
balance sheet;

    - Revenue and expenses, including comparative balances, are translated at the exchange rates in force
on the date of each transaction; and

    - Exchange rate differences resulting from the application of the above criteria are recognised as
translation differences in other comprehensive income;

This same criteria are applicable to the translation of financial statements of companies accounted for
using the equity method, whose translation differences that correspond to the Group's interest are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash flows, including comparative balances,
of foreign subsidiaries and joint businesses are translated into euros by applying exchange rates existing
on the date on which they took place.

Translation differences recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit/(loss), as an
adjustment to the profit/(loss) from the sale, following the criteria set out in the sections on subsidiary
and associate entities.

**_g)_** **_Changes in the scope of consolidation-_**

_2022:_

The changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in 2022 were as follows:

   - In March 2022, Grupo Antolin sold all of its 61% holding in the Chinese joint ventures Chongqing Antolin

Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and Harbin Antolin
Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., to their current shareholder, Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd.

   - In March 2022 Grupo Antolin sold 100% of its ownership interest in the US company Antolin Spartanburg

Assembly, Inc. to the Motus Integrated Technologies Group.

h d h lf f l d h d l d


-----

as the North American companies Antolin Nashville, LLC and Antolin Insurance Company, LLC, in which
the Group has a 100% interest in its share capital.

- In July 2022 the Group acquired an additional 51% stake in the share capital of Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan)
Automotive Trim Co, Ltd., in which it had previously held 49%, for a price of practically zero. As a result of
this transaction, the Group now has a 100% shareholding in said company and exercises control over it.
Accordingly, this company, over which the Group exercised significant influence, has changed from an
associated company to a subsidiary company and, in consequence, is now “fully consolidated”.

 - The dissolution and liquidation of the subsidiary Gestión Industrial de Sonora, S.A. de C.V., which was

inactive.

Also in 2022 the Group acquired the shareholding held by non-controlling interests in the subsidiary company
Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan) Overhead Systems, Co., Ltd., over which the Group exercised control, for an
amount of 1,379 thousand euros. As a result of this transaction, the Group's holding in this company increased
from 51% to 100%. This transaction has not resulted in any changes to the scope of consolidation.

Details at 31 December 2021 of the assets and liabilities of the mentioned companies excluded from the scope
of consolidation in 2022 because the Group lost control over them are as follows:

(a) Relating to the consolidated carrying amounts of the subgroup headed by this company and including the

income and expenses of the companies that were wholly owned by it (Hangzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead
_System Co., Ltd. and Harbin Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd.)._

(b) Income and expenses before the elimination of transactions with other Group companies.

The income and expenses and results of the companies disposed of during the period between the start of
2022 and the date on which these companies were disposed of were of little significance, and the net changes
in its assets and liabilities over the same period were also immaterial.

As a result of the sale of these companies, as well as the dissolution and liquidation of Gestión Industrial de
Sonora, S.A. de C.V., the Group incurred a net loss of 324 thousand euros, which is recognised under “Gains
or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests” in the accompanying consolidated income
statement for 2022.

The effect of the additions of companies to the scope of consolidation in 2022 on the Group’s consolidated
financial statements has not been significant.

_2021:_

The changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in 2021 were as follows:

- The incorporation of Antolin St. Clair, LLC., in the United States of America, by contribution of the
productive business unit in St. Clair, formerly the property of the subsidiary Antolin Interiors USA, Inc., in
which the Group holds a 100% interest.

- The incorporation of Shanghai Antolin Naen Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd., a “joint venture'” created
with NAEN Auto Technology which specialises in the electronics of keyless vehicle entry and ignition
systems, in which the Group holds a 51% interest.

- The incorporation of Hefei Antolin Auto Parts Co., Ltd., a “joint venture'" created with Changshu
Automotive Trim Co., Ltd., in which the Group, through its subsidiary Changshu Antolin Automotive
Interiors Co., Ltd. holds an effective 60% interest in its share capital.

- In 2021 the dissolution and liquidation took place of the subsidiaries Grupo Antolin-Holland, B.V. and

Mexican Door Company, S. de R.L. de C.V.

These changes have had a very insignificant impact on the 2021 consolidated annual financial statements.


-----

**(3)** **ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND MEASUREMENT CRITERIA**

In preparing the consolidated annual financial statements for 2022 the following accounting principles and policies
and measurement criteria were applied:

**_a)_** **_Going-concern principle-_**

Russia's invasion of Ukraine at the end of February 2022 and its impact on the European energy market has
contributed to a significant slowdown in almost all European countries' economies. If we add to this factor
the continuing shortage of microchips, the persistence of bottlenecks in supply chains, the sporadic
shutdowns of activity due to Covid-19 in some cities in China, the generalised inflation linked to the rest of
the production factors and the interest rate hikes in Europe and the United States, the negative effect on the
pace of economic growth is more than notable compared to the expectations that were created at the
beginning of the year. The automotive sector has been significantly affected by the impact of all these factors,
especially in the first half of 2022, and improved progressively in the second half of 2022, and has recorded
finally an increase in its production volumes in 2022 of 6% compared to 2021. Thus, the number of vehicles
manufactured in 2022 amounted to 82 million units compared to the 77 million units manufactured in 2021.

In this context, Grupo Antolin’s revenue, including the sale of tools on behalf of customers, increased by 9.7%
on the figure for 2021, and it reported a loss attributable to the Parent _(225.6 million euros) and a 5.5%_
increase in EBITDA _(operating profit from ordinary continuing operations + depreciation and amortisation_
_charge). In view of this situation, and as a result of the existence in the Syndicated Loan and Revolving Credit_
Facility agreement of clauses in which, among other factors, the failure of the Group to achieve the financial
ratios established in said financing agreement would be considered to be grounds for the early maturity of
the full amount of the financing, Grupo Antolin has continued monitoring the situation and also periodically
estimates the value of the aforementioned ratios. The latest estimates made do not expect the Group to fail
to achieve these ratios in the twelve months following the date of authorisation for issue of these financial
statements.

In addition, Grupo Antolin monitors all the variables that can affect the aforementioned ratios and adopts the
appropriate measure to enable it to mitigate and eliminate the possibility of failing to achieve the established
ratios. Also, the implementation of the GOA program that commenced in 2022 will speed up the
transformation of Grupo Antolin into a more profitable, more efficient, more innovative and more customeroriented company; this, together with the far-reaching diversification of the Group’s business model in
geographical, customer and product terms, allows it to face up to all of these issues with a large measure of
serenity and confidence. In addition, the Group is focused on harnessing the business potential offered by
future mobility. With this objective, the new strategic plan prioritises and continues the lines of work initiated
in recent years, developing the Smart Integrator strategy, on which the Group has been working for some
time and which is based on the development of more complex, higher added-value systems that offer new
functionalities including new technology, electronics and lighting solutions.

The Parent’s directors consider that the economic and financial measures carried out, as well as the
cornerstones on which its strategic plan is based, will contribute positively to making the Group stronger, more
efficient and more competitive, and enable it to continue to grow and meet its profitability targets.
Accordingly, the consolidated annual financial statements for 2022 were prepared in accordance with the
going concern basis of accounting.

**_b)_** **_Goodwill-_**

“Goodwill” is only recorded when it has been acquired for a consideration and represents, therefore, advance
payments made by the acquiring entity for the future economic benefits deriving from the assets of the
acquired entity that are not individually and separately identifiable and recognisable.

In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment _(i.e. a reduction in the_
_recoverable amount of the “Goodwill” to below its book value) at the end of each reporting period and any_
i i t i h d t “N t i i t l t t ” i th lid t d i


-----

The recoverable value of goodwill and of other intangible and tangible assets is measured as the higher of fair
value less costs to sell and value in use, understood to be the present value of expected future cash flows
from the investment. The Group's Directors apply the following methodology to test goodwill, other
intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment (see Notes 7 and 8):

  - The recoverable amounts are calculated for each cash generating unit (CGU). The goodwill acquired in a
business combination is assigned to each one of the cash generating units or groups of cash generating
units that are expected to benefit from the combination synergies. Each unit or group of units to which
goodwill is assigned represents the lowest level in the entity at which goodwill is controlled for internal
management purposes. Note 7. For the purpose of intangible and tangible fixed assets, cash generating
units are associated with the projects.

  - The Group's Directors regularly prepare a business plan for each cash generating unit, broken down by
market and activity, covering a period of at least five years. An annual budget is also prepared each year
for the following financial year. The main components of said plan and budget are:

       - Results forecasts.

       - Investment and working capital forecasts.

  - Other variables influencing the calculation of recoverable value are:

       - The discount rate to be applied, i.e. the weighted average cost of capital. The main factors
affecting this are the cost of the liabilities and specific risks related to the assets.

       - The growth rate applied to cash flows to extrapolate them beyond the period covered by budgets
and forecasts, up to five financial years.

Forecasts are prepared on the basis of past experience and the best available estimates in line with externally
obtained information.

The business plans thus prepared are reviewed and approved by the Parent's Board of Directors.

If an impairment loss must be recognised for a cash generating unit to which all or part of the goodwill has
been assigned, first the book value of the goodwill corresponding to the cash generating unit will be reduced.
If the impairment loss exceeds the amount of goodwill, the rest of assets allocated to the CGU are then written
down, in proportion to their book values, up to the limit of the higher of the following: fair value less cost to
sell, value in use and zero.

At 2022 and 2021 year-end no goodwill impairment was recorded.

“Goodwill” recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 corresponds
basically to the consolidated subsidiaries and plants acquired in 2015 from the international Magna
Automotive group and other companies forming part of the “Lighting” business acquired from the “CML
Innovative Technologies” group in 2012, and other non-material goodwill recognised (see Note 7).

**_c)_** **_Other intangible assets-_**

Intangible assets are stated initially at acquisition or production cost and subsequently at cost less any
accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.

_Development expenses-_

The costs incurred in each development project are capitalised when the following conditions are met:

The development cost of the asset can be assessed reliably


-----

      - The costs are specifically itemised for each project and correspond to an identifiable asset.

      - The Group can prove that the project is technically viable.

      - The project is likely to generate profits in the future.

Development expenses incurred using the Group's own resources are recorded (by type) in the consolidated
income statement, while development expenses for projects which meet the above conditions are debited
against “Development expenses” in the consolidated statement of financial position and credited to “Own
work capitalised” in the consolidated income statement.

Capitalised development expenses are in practically all cases amortised on a straight-line basis over the
estimated useful lives of the projects as from the date the related projects are completed.

Development expenses relate mainly to the costs incurred in this connection by the consolidated subsidiary
Grupo Antolin-Ingeniería, S.A.U. and the Group's other research and development centres. Research expenses
are taken directly to income in the financial year in which they are incurred.

_Software and other intangible assets-_

Other intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised accordingly, using criteria similar to those used
for property, plant and equipment. Specifically, “Computer software” is written off over a period of 5 years
as from when it starts to be used.

When accounting for the business combination involving the companies and plants acquired in 2015 from the
international Magna Automotive group, “Customer relations” in the automobile industry was identified as an
intangible asset, on the basis that one of the Group's aims in carrying out said operation was to develop new
services and products in this sector. This intangible asset has been measured at its fair value. The remaining
useful life of this intangible asset was estimated between 2 and 7 years, over which period it will be amortised.

The annual amortisation expense for intangible assets with finite useful lives is charged to “Depreciation and
amortisation expenses” on the consolidated income statement.

_Impairment losses-_

The consolidated companies recognise any impairment loss in the book value of the assets associated with
the CGUs with a charge to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income
statement. The criteria used to recognise the impairment losses on these assets associated with the CGUs
and, where applicable, the recovery of impairment losses recorded in prior years, are similar to those applied
for property, plant and equipment for own use.

**_d)_** **_Property, plant and equipment-_**

Property, plant and equipment include the assets that the Group has for its current or future use in producing
or supplying goods and services or for administrative purposes and which are expected to be used for more
than one financial year. Property, plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement of financial
position at their acquisition or production cost, adjusted or revalued, whenever applicable, in accordance with
applicable legal provisions, or at their “fair value” as determined by independent experts on the date of
transition to “IFRS-EU” _(1 January 2006), the amount of which is recorded as an attributed cost, less_
accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.

The cost of extensions, modernisations or improvements that increase the productivity, capacity or efficiency
or prolong the useful life of an asset are capitalised as an increase in the cost of said asset.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to building or developing property, plant and equipment that necessarily
take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are added to the cost of those assets


-----

specifically for building said assets, the amount of the interest and other finance costs capitalised reflects the
actual costs incurred during the period, less income earned from temporarily reinvesting the financing that
has not yet been invested in the qualifying assets. Where the financing received is of a general nature, the
amount of interest capitalised is calculated using a rate based on the weighted average of the interest costs
applicable to the average unrepaid financing in the year excluding financing for specific purposes. However,
the capitalisation of interest is suspended during the periods in which the construction work is at a standstill,
provided that such periods are not particularly long. In 2022 and 2021, the Group had not capitalised any
finance costs as an increase in the book value of “Property, plant and equipment”.

Upkeep and maintenance expenses for property, plant and equipment for own use are expensed in the year
they are incurred.

The Group transfers PP&E under construction to PP&E used in operations when the assets in question become
operational, from which time depreciation is charged.

Property, plant and equipment used in operations are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on the
acquisition or production cost of the assets or their restated value, less their residual value. The land on which
buildings and other constructions are located is deemed to have an indefinite lifespan and is therefore not
subject to depreciation. Annual depreciation charges on property, plant and equipment are charged to
“Depreciation and amortisation expenses” in the consolidated income statement over the average estimated
useful life of the assets, as indicated below:

Years of
estimated

Type of asset useful life

**Buildings and other structures** 20-50
**Plant and machinery-**
Machinery 5-12.5
Plant 6-25
**Other plant, tools and furniture-**
Tools, dies and moulds 2-6
Office furniture and equipment 5-10
**Other property, plant and equipment-**
Vehicles 5-10
Information technology equipment 4-5

Reviews are made at regular intervals of the estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment for own
use in order to identify any significant changes therein. If any such changes are identified, the relevant
adjustment is made to the depreciation charged to the consolidated income statements in future years based
on the new useful lives.

At the end of each reporting period, the consolidated companies test for any internal or external signs that
the recoverable amount of their property, plant and equipment associated with the cash generating units is
less than the book value. If so, the book value is reduced to the recoverable value and the future charges for
depreciation are adjusted in proportion to their adjusted book value and their new remaining useful life if it
was also necessary to re-estimate this. Any such reduction in the book value of property, plant and equipment
for own use associated with the cash generating units is charged to “Net impairment losses on non-current
assets” in the consolidated income statement.

Similarly, whenever there are signs that the value of an impaired tangible asset has recovered, the
consolidated companies reverse impairment losses recognised in prior years, with a credit to “Net impairment
losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement and adjusting future depreciation charges
accordingly. The increased book value may not exceed the book value that would have been determined had
no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset.

|Type of asset|Years of estimated useful life|
|---|---|
|Buildings and other structures Plant and machinery- Machinery Plant Other plant, tools and furniture- Tools, dies and moulds Office furniture and equipment Other property, plant and equipment- Vehicles Information technology equipment|20-50 5-12.5 6-25 2-6 5-10 5-10 4-5|


-----

**_e)_** **_Investment property-_**

Investment property comprises land, buildings or other constructions held to earn rents or for capital
appreciation upon disposal due to future increases in their respective market prices.

The same methods of valuation, depreciation, and for estimating their respective useful lives and recording
any impairment losses are used as for property, plant and equipment for own use.

**_f)_** **_Accounting for leasing operations-_**

_As lessor-_

Whenever the Group acts as lessor, the cost of acquiring the assets leased is stated in “Investment property”
or “Property, plant and equipment”. Depreciation is charged on these assets in accordance with the policies
adopted for similar PP&E items for own use, and the revenues from the lease contracts are released to the
consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis.

_As lessee-_

In agreements that contain one or more lease and non-lease components, the Group assigns the
consideration to each lease component in accordance with the separate sale price of the lease component
and the individual aggregate price of the various lease components.

Payments made by the Group that do not entail the transfer of goods or services to it by the lessor do not
constitute a separate lease component, and instead form part of the total lease consideration.

At the start of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset
comprises the amount of the lease liability, any lease payment made on or prior to the starting date, less any
incentives received, any direct start-up costs incurred and an estimate of the decommissioning or restoration
costs to be incurred, as indicated in the provision accounting policy.

The Group measures the lease liability as the present value of outstanding lease payments on the starting
date. The Group discounts lease payments at the appropriate incremental interest rate, unless the lessor's
implicit interest rate can be reliably determined.

Outstanding lease payments are composed of fixed payments, less any incentive receivable, variable
payments dependent on an index or rate, initially measured by the index or rate applicable on the starting
date, amounts to be paid by residual value guarantees, the price for the purchase option whose exercise is
reasonably expected and the payments of compensation for lease cancellation, providing the term of the
lease reflects the exercise of the cancellation option.

The Group measures right-of-use assets at cost, less any depreciation and accumulated impairment losses,
adjusted by any re-calculation of the lease liability.

If the agreement transfers ownership of the asset to the Group at the end of the lease or the right-of-use
asset includes the purchase option price, the depreciation method indicated in the property, plant and
equipment section from the starting date of the lease to the end of the useful life of the asset is applied.
Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the starting date to the earlier date between
the useful life of the right or the end of the lease term.

The Group applies non-current asset impairment loss criteria to the right-of-use asset, in accordance with the
contents of Notes 3-b, 3-c and 3-d.

The Group measures lease liability by increasing it by the accrued financial expense, decreasing it by payments
made and re-calculating the book value for lease modifications or to reflect updates of in-substance fixed


-----

The Group records variable payments not included in the initial measurement of profit/(loss) for the period
in which the events that trigger its payment take place.

The Group records liability re-calculations as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset, until this is reduced to
zero and subsequently in profit/(loss).

The Group reassesses the lease liability, discounting lease payments at an updated rate, if a change to the
term of the lease or a change in the expectations of exercising the purchase option for the underlying asset
take place.

The Group reassesses the lease liability if a change takes place in the amounts to be paid by residual value
guarantees or a change to the index or rate used to determine the payments, including a change to reflect
changes in market rents once a revision takes place.

The Group recognises a lease modification as a separate lease if this increases the scope of the lease by adding
one or more usage rights and the amount of the consideration for the lease increases by an amount consistent
with the individual price for the increase in scope, and any adjustment to the individual price to reflect the
specific circumstances of the contract.

If the modification does not result in a separate lease on the modification date, the Group assigns the
consideration to the modified lease as indicated above, re-determines the lease term and reassesses the value
of the liability less the revised payments at the revised interest rate. The Group decreases the book value of
the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or total conclusion of the lease, in those modifications that
decrease the scope of the lease and records it in profit/(loss). For all other modifications the Group adjusts
the book value of the right-of-use asset.

_i)_ _Short-term leases and leases where the asset is of low value-_

The Group applies the exemptions for recognising short-term leases _(those leases with terms of 12_
_months or less from the inception date and that do not include a purchase option) and leases in which the_
underlying asset is of low value (for example, less than 6,000 euros). The lease payments deriving from
these contracts are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term under “Other operating
expenses” in the consolidated income statement.

_ii)_ _Establishing the lease terms of contracts with options to extend-_

The Group establishes the lease term as the irrevocable period of a lease plus: (i) any periods covered by
an option to extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise this option; and (ii)
any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will not
exercise this option.

When evaluating if it is reasonably likely the option to extend a lease will be exercised or the option to
terminate a lease will not be exercised, the Group takes into account any relevant events and
circumstances prompting the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease or not exercise the option
to terminate the lease.

After the inception date, the Group will re-evaluate the lease term whenever there is a significant event
or change in the circumstances under the Group's control which affects whether or not there is
reasonable certainty the options will or will not be exercised.

**_g)_** **_Non-current assets held for sale-_**

Assets which are highly likely to be sold, in their present condition, within one year from the end of the
reporting period are recorded under this heading in the consolidated annual financial statements. The book
value of these assets is, therefore, expected to be recovered via their selling price rather than from their
ongoing use. Assets classified as “Non-current assets held for sale” are stated at the lower of their book value


-----

when they are classified as such and their fair value net of their estimated cost to sell. Amortisable intangible
assets and depreciable PP&E are not amortised or depreciated while classified as held for sale.

In 2022 and 2021 the Group held land in Tangiers (Morocco) acquired in 2014 classified under “Non-current
assets held for sale”. Based on assessments made by an independent expert and offers recently received, the
fair value of this building is at least equal to its book value. It is expected to be sold over the next twelve
months.

Also, at 2022 year-end, the assets of the Russian subsidiaries were classified under “Non-Current Assets
Classified as Held for Sale” in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position. The
aforementioned subsidiaries make up the “Russia” geographical segment, which at that date was in the
process of being sold, and was ultimately sold in March 2023. The liabilities of these subsidiaries were also
recognised in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December under
“Liabilities Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale” (see Notes 3-q, 6 and 25).

**_h)_** **_Inventories-_**

The Group values its inventories as follows:

   - Raw materials and other supplies, packaging and containers, replacement parts, sundry materials, add-on
parts and stocks for resale are valued at the lower of cost applying the weighted average price method,
and net realisable value.

   - Finished goods, semi-finished goods and work-in-process are stated at the lower of real average
_production cost (raw and other materials used, labour and direct and indirect manufacturing expenses)_
_and net realisable value._

   - Tools for new projects, which are developed and manufactured by the Group to be sold later on to its
customers, are stated at the lower of either the costs incurred to manufacture them, as and when they
are incurred, and their estimated realisable value.

Net realisable value corresponds to the estimated selling price less the estimated costs of completing the
products and the costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Obsolete, defective or slow-moving inventories have been reduced to their realisable value. The Group
recognises the appropriate valuation adjustments as an expense when the net realisable value of the
inventory is lower than its acquisition or production cost.

**_i)_** **_Financial instruments-_**

_Recognition and classification of financial instruments-_

Financial instruments are classified at initial recognition as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity
instruments, in accordance with the underlying economic value of the agreement and with the definitions of
financial asset, financial liability or equity instrument provided in IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation”.

Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party bound to a contract or legal
transaction in accordance with its provisions.

For valuation purposes, the Group classifies financial instruments in categories of financial assets and
liabilities at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), separating those initially designated from those held for
trading or obligatorily measured at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), financial assets and liabilities
measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive
income, separating equity instruments designated as such from the rest of the financial assets. The Group
classifies financial assets, other than those designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss) and equity
instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income in accordance with the


-----

measured at amortised cost, except those designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss) and those held
for trading.

The Group classifies a financial asset or liability as held for trading if:

- It is acquired or incurred mainly to sell or repurchase it in the immediate future;

- During initial recognition it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that are jointly
managed and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking;

- It is a derivative, except a derivative designated as a hedging instrument and complies with conditions for
effectiveness, and a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract, or

- It is an obligation to deliver financial assets borrowed but not yet owned.

The Group classifies a financial asset at amortised cost, if it is maintained within the scope of a business model
whose objective is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows and the contractual conditions of the
financial asset generate, on specified dates, cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only on the
amount of outstanding principle.

The Group classifies a financial asset at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income if it is
maintained within the scope of a business model whose objective is attained by obtaining contractual cash
flows and selling financial assets and the contractual conditions of the financial asset generate, on specified
dates, cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only.

The business model is determined by core Group personnel and at a level that reflects the way in which groups
of financial assets are jointly managed to attain a specific business objective. The Group's business model
represents the way in which it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows.

Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows are
managed to generate cash flows as contract collections throughout the instrument's life. The Group manages
the assets held in the portfolio to collect the specific contractual cash flows. To determine whether the cash
flows are obtained through the collection of contractual cash flows from the financial assets, the Group
considers the frequency, value and sale calendar in prior years, the reasons for those sales and expectations
with regard to future sales activity. Nevertheless, the sales themselves do not determine the business model
and, therefore, may not be considered on their own. Instead, it is the information on past sales and future
sale expectations that provides indicative data on the means of attaining the Group's stated purpose with
respect to the management of financial assets and, more specifically, the way in which cash flows are
obtained. The Group considers the information on past sales within the context of the reasons for these sales
and of the conditions that existed at that time in comparison with current ones. For these purposes, the Group
considers that trade and other receivables that will be transferred to third parties and do not involve
derecognition are maintained in this business model.

While the purpose of the Group's business model is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows, the
Group does not hold all instruments to maturity. Thus, the Group's business model is holding financial assets
to receive contractual cash flows even when sales of those assets take place or are expected to take place in
the future. The Group understands that it complies with the requirement, providing that the sales occur owing
to an increased credit risk of the financial assets. In all other cases, at the individual and aggregate level, sales
must be of minor significance, whether they are frequent or infrequent, even if they may be significant.

Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and
sell them, are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections and to sell them according to the
Group's varying needs. In this type of business model and in order to comply with this objective, the Group's
core management personnel have decided that the attainment of contractual cash flows and sale of financial
assets are essential. To achieve this objective, the Group obtains contractual cash flows and sells financial
assets. Compared to the previous business model, in this business model the Group regularly makes asset
sales more frequently and of greater value.


-----

The contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only are consistent with a basic loan
agreement. In a basic loan agreement, the most significant elements of interest are generally the
consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk. Nevertheless, in an agreement of this type, the
interest also includes the consideration for other risks, such as the risk of liquidity and costs, like the
administrative costs of a basic loan associated with holding the financial asset for a given period. Furthermore,
the interest may include a profit mark-up that may be consistent with a basic loan agreement.

The Group designates a financial asset initially at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), if by doing so it
eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition that may otherwise
arise, if the measurement of the assets or liabilities or recognition of the profit/(loss) were to take place made
on different bases.

All other financial assets are classified at fair value with changes in profit/(loss).

Financial assets and liabilities arising from contingent consideration in a business combination are classified
as financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit/(loss).

The Group initially designates a financial liability at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), if by doing so it
eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition of its profit/(loss)
that would otherwise derive, if the assets or liability or the recognition of the profit/(loss) is made on different
bases or a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and liabilities is managed, and its return is evaluated,
based on fair value, in keeping with an investment or documented risk management strategy, and information
is furnished internally to that group on that same basis to the Group's core management personnel.

The Group classifies all other financial liabilities, except financial guarantee contracts, loan commitments
below market interest rate and financial liabilities resulting from a transfer of financial assets that do not
qualify for derecognition or are recorded using the continuing involvement approach, as financial liabilities at
amortised cost.

_Offset principles-_

Financial assets and financial liabilities may be offset only when the Group currently has the legal right to
offset recognised amounts and intends to settle by offset or simultaneously realise the assets and cancel the
liabilities. For the Group to have the currently legal right, it may not be contingent on a future event and
should be legally required in the ordinary course of operations, in the event of insolvency or legally declared
liquidation and in the event of non-payment.

_Financial assets measured at cost-_

Investments in equity instruments for which there is insufficient information for measurement or in which a
broad range of measurements exist and the related derivatives have to be settled by the delivery of those
investments, are measured at cost. However, if the Group may at any time have a reliable measurement of
the asset or the contract, these will be recognised at fair value at that time, recording the profits or losses in
profit/(loss) or other comprehensive income, if the instrument is designated at fair value with changes in
other comprehensive income.

_Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost-_

_Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost are initially recognised at their fair value, plus or minus any_
_transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest_
method.


-----

_Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit/(Ioss)-_

Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit/(loss) are initially recognised at fair value.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase or issue are recognised as an expense when they are
incurred.

Initially, the fair value of a financial instrument is normally the transaction price, unless that price contains
several instrument elements, in which case the Group determines its fair value. If the Group determines that
an instrument's fair value differs from the transaction price, it records the difference in profit/(loss), to the
extent that the value is obtained by reference to a price of an identical asset or liability quoted on an active
market, or was obtained by a valuation technique that only uses observable data. In other cases, the Group
recognises the difference in profit/(loss), to the extent that it derives from a change in a factor that market
participants would consider when determining the price of the asset or liability.

Subsequently to its initial recognition, it is recognised at fair value with changes in profit/(loss). Changes in
fair value include the interest and dividend component. Fair value does not decrease due to the transaction
costs that may be incurred through its eventual sale or disposal by other means.

Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), the
Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income.
Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income
statement.

The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the internal
rate of return at the start of the period using fair value and contractual cash flows, and deducts the reference
interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, providing that the
change in reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could entail
significant changes to fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the rate
determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk component.
The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change linked to
the credit risk.

Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), the
Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income.
Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income
statement.

The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the internal
rate of return at the start of the period using fair value and contractual cash flows, and deducts the reference
interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, providing that the
change in reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could entail
significant changes to the fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the
rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk
component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the
change linked to the credit risk.

_Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income-_

_Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair_
value plus any transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase.

Following initial recognition, the financial assets classified in this category are measured at fair value,
recognising profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the exception of profit and loss by exchange
rate, as set out in the section on foreign currency transactions, and expected credit losses. The amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit/(loss) as soon as financial asset
derecognition takes place. However, the interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised


-----

As indicated above, the Group has designated certain equity instruments as measured at fair value with
changes in other comprehensive income. Following initial recognition, the equity instruments are measured
at fair value, recognising the profit or loss in other comprehensive income. The amounts recognised in other
comprehensive income are not re-classified to profit/(loss), without prejudice to their re-classification to
reserves at the moment of instrument derecognition.

_Fair value of financial instruments-_

The “fair value” of a financial instrument on a particular date is defined as the amount at which it could have
been exchanged at that date between knowledgeable parties in arm's length transactions. The most objective
and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid for it on an
organised, transparent and deep market (“quoted price” or “market price”).

When there is no market price for a specific financial instrument, fair value is estimated on the basis of recent
arm's length transactions in similar instruments and, if there are none, using measurement models that have
been sufficiently verified by the international financial community, bearing in mind the specific nature of the
instrument to be valued and, in particular, the different types of risk associated with it.

For financial reporting purposes, measurements of fair value are classified under three levels according to the
extent to which the inputs applied are observable and according to how significant said inputs are for the
entire measurement:

- Level 1: inputs are quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

- Level 2: inputs are quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities (not included within Level
_1), quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and techniques_
based on measurement models for which all the significant inputs are derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.

- Level 3: inputs are generally unobservable and reflect estimates based on market assumptions to
determine the price of the asset or liability. Unobservable data used in measurement models are a
significant part of the fair value of the assets and liabilities.

_Impairment-_

Since 1 January 2018, financial assets valued at amortised cost, trade receivables and other loans, in addition
to financial guarantee contracts, have been subject to the recording of an impairment loss based on the
expected loss of credit, either at 12 months (assets classified as investments available for sale) or over the
whole lifetime (trade debtor accounts). In order to calculate the impairment loss based on the expected loss,
the Group has established a model which requires estimates of future credit losses using a simplified
approach. Given the nature, conditions and high credit quality of its accounts receivable and loans, the
amount of impairment losses required as a result of the application of the new model to the financial asset
balances is usually of little significance.

_Financial instrument derecognition, modifications or cancellations-_

The Group applies financial asset derecognition criteria to part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar
financial assets, or to financial assets or a group of similar financial assets.

Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them are terminated or
transferred, and the Group substantially transfers the risks and benefits deriving from their ownership.
Furthermore, the derecognition of financial assets in those circumstances in which the Group retains the
contractual rights to receive cash flows only occurs when contractual obligations that determine the payment
of those flows to one or more recipients have been assumed, and the following requirements are fulfilled:

- Payment of cash flows is conditioned on its prior collection;


-----

- The Group may not proceed to sell or pledge the financial asset; and

- Cash flows collected on behalf of the eventual recipients are sent with significant delay, and the Group is
not entitled to reinvest the cash flows. The application of this criterion does not include investments in
cash or cash equivalents made by the Group during the settlement period between the collection date
and delivery date stipulated with the eventual recipients, providing any interest accrued is attributed to
the eventual recipients.

In those cases in which the Group transfers a financial asset in its entirety but retains the administration rights
to them in exchange for a fee, an asset or liability is recognised in keeping with the rendering of that service.
If the consideration received is less than the expenses to be incurred as a result of rendering the service, a
liability is recognised for an amount equivalent to the obligations assumed measured at fair value. If the
consideration for the service is greater than what would result from applying adequate remuneration, an
asset is recognised for the administration rights.

In transactions in which the total derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the financial assets obtained
or the financial liabilities, including the liabilities corresponding to administration services incurred, are
recorded at fair value.

In transactions in which the partial derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the book value of the
complete financial asset is assigned to the part sold and to the part held, including any assets corresponding
to administration services, in proportion to the relative fair value of each of them.

The total derecognition of a financial asset entails the recognition of profit/(loss) of the difference between
its book value and the sum of the consideration received, net of transaction expenses, including any assets
obtained or liabilities assumed and any deferred profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the
exception of equity instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income.

The criteria for the derecognition of financial assets in transactions in which the Group neither transfers nor
substantially maintains the risks and benefits inherent to ownership are based on the analysis of the degree
of control maintained. In this way:

- If the Group does not retain control, the financial asset is derecognised and any rights or obligations
created or retained as a result of the transfer are recognised separately as assets or liabilities.

- If the control is retained, the financial asset will continue to be recognised for the Group's continued
commitment in it and an associated liability is recorded. The continued commitment in the financial asset
is determined by the amount of its exposure to changes in value of that asset. The associated asset and
liability are measured on the basis of the rights and obligations recognised by the Group. The associated
liability is recognised so that the book value of the asset and associated liability is equal to the amortised
cost of the rights and obligations retained by the Group, when the asset is measured at amortised cost,
or at the fair value of the rights and obligations maintained by the Group if the asset is measured at fair
value. The Group continues to recognise revenue deriving from the asset to the extent of its continued
commitment and expenses deriving from the associated liability. Changes in the fair value of the asset
and associated liability are consistently recognised in profit/(loss) or in equity, in keeping with the general
recognition criteria set out above, and should not be offset.

Those transactions in which the Group substantially retains all risks and benefits inherent to the ownership
of a transferred financial asset are recorded by recognition of the consideration received in the liability
accounts. Transaction expenses are recognised in profit/(loss) following the effective interest method.

The Group applies weighted average price criteria to measure and derecognise the cost of equity instruments
that form part of homogeneous portfolios and that have the same rights, unless the instruments sold and
their individual cost may be clearly identified. For debt instruments, it determines the cost at the individual
or group level consistently with the unit of account used to determine impairment


-----

If the Group modifies the contractual cash flows of a financial asset, insofar as this does not entail its
derecognition, the book value is re-calculated by the present value of the flows modified at the effective
interest rate or effective interest rate adjusted by the original credit risk, and recognises the difference in
profit/(loss). The costs and fees invoiced by the Group adjust the book value of the financial asset and
depreciates them during the remaining life of the modified financial asset.

At 31 December 2022 the outstanding receivables transferred without recourse to financial institutions and
pending maturity at that date amounted to 122,605 thousand euros (86,264 thousand euros at 31 December
_2021)._

_Interest and dividends-_

The Group recognises interest by the effective interest method, which is the update rate that makes a financial
instrument's book value equal to the estimated cash flows throughout the instrument's expected life, based
on its contractual conditions and without considering expected credit losses, except for financial assets
acquired or arising from incurred losses.

The interest recognised on the gross book value of the financial assets, except for financial assets acquired or
arising from incurred credit losses and financial assets with impaired credit. For the former, the Group
recognises interest by the effective interest rate adjusted by the initial credit risk, and for the latter, the Group
recognises the interest on the amortised cost.

Changes in cash flow estimates are deducted at the effective interest rate or the interest rate adjusted by the
original credit risk and are recognised in profit/(loss).

Revenue for dividends from investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit/(loss) when rights arise
for the Group upon collecting them, financial profit collection is probable, and the amount may be reliably
estimated.

Dividends from equity instruments classified at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are
recognised in profit/(loss), unless they represent a return on the investment, in which case they are
recognised in other comprehensive income.

The Group recognises default interest in commercial transactions as financial income and expenses in keeping
with the legal and contractual conditions stipulated. If that interest is ultimately offset or condoned, the
Group recognises the transaction in accordance with its substance. The Group recognises the legal right to
offset collection management costs incurred when collection is probable. The Group recognises the expense
for the claim of collection management costs as indicated in the provision accounting policy.

_Financial liability derecognition and modification-_

The Group derecognises a financial liability or part thereof following compliance with the obligation contained
in the liability or when it is legally dispensed from the main accountability in the liability, whether by judicial
process or by the creditor.

The exchange of debt instruments between the Group and the counterparty or substantial modifications to
initially recognised liabilities are recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability and the recognition
of a new financial liability, providing that the instruments have substantially different conditions.

The Group considers the conditions to be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows
deducted under the new conditions, including any fee paid net of any fee received, and using the original
effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by at least 10% from the present discounted value of the
remaining cash flows of the original financial liability.

If the exchange is recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability the costs or fees are recognised


-----

effective interest rate, recognising any difference with the prior book value in profit/(loss). Furthermore, the
costs or fees adjust the book value of the financial liabilities and are amortised by the amortised cost method
during the remaining life of the modified liability.

The Group recognises the difference between the book value of the financial liability or part thereof that is
cancelled or transferred to a third party and the consideration paid, including any asset transferred other than
the cash or liability assumed in profit/(loss).

**_j)_** **_Balances and transactions denominated in foreign currencies-_**

The Group uses the euro as its presentation currency. Consequently, transactions in other currencies are
considered denominated in foreign currency and are recorded according to the exchange rates prevailing on
the transaction date. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the
consolidated income statement as and when they occur.

At the year-end, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to euros at
the rate prevailing at the end of the consolidated statement of financial position. Any resulting gains or losses
are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.

**_k)_** **_Provisions and contingencies-_**

Provisions are current obligations of the Group, arising as a result of past events, the nature of which is clearly
specified as at the date of the consolidated annual financial statements, but whose amount and/or reversal
date are uncertain and the reversal of which will probably result in an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group, arising as a result of past events, which depend on
whether or not one or more events beyond the Group's control occur in the future. They include the Group's
current obligations whose settlement will probably not require an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits, or where a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made.

Provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position wherever it is more likely than
not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, but rather, whenever applicable, are disclosed
in the notes to the financial statements.

Provisions are measured using the best information available of the expenditures required to settle the
obligation and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the current best
estimate. They are used to meet the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised and are
fully or partially reversed when those obligations cease to exist or are reduced.

The value of these provisions corresponds to the current value of the best estimate possible of the amount
necessary to cancel or transfer the obligation, recording the adjustments made from updating said provisions
as financial costs as they accrue. Specifically, the liabilities recorded under “Current provisions” in the
consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 correspond to provisions made to cover
losses which certain subsidiaries are expected to incur to comply with contracts signed prior to the end of the
reporting period and whose costs will exceed the expected returns generated. The provision is made when
the liabilities in respect of the contracts arise for the affected companies (see Note 16).

The provisions deemed necessary in accordance with these criteria, and the reversals thereof, are recorded
as a charge or credit, respectively, in the consolidated income statement.

**_l)_** **_Termination benefits-_**

Under current employment legislation group companies are obliged to pay termination benefits to


-----

Where the amount of the benefits can be reasonably estimated, such benefits are recognised as an expense
in the year in which the decision is made, provided the parties involved have been formally notified and there
is, therefore, a valid expectation on the part of those involved that the consolidated companies will make the
dismissals. The attached consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 includes several
provisions for this concept.

**_m) Pension commitments-_**

Some Grupo Antolin companies have assumed commitments to pay contributions to the retirement pensions
of some of their current and former employees (retirement plans based on years of service, age and salary).
These commitments affect, primarily, group companies located in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom,
France, Mexico and India.

A significant portion of these commitments has been outsourced and is covered by insurance policies or
pension plans with insurance companies. The Group pays fixed contributions into a fund and is obliged to
make additional contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all the employees the benefits
to which it is committed.

The Group records the present value of these defined benefit commitments as liabilities in the consolidated
statement of financial position under “Non-current provisions”, net of the fair value of the assets that meet
the requirements to be treated as “assets earmarked for the plan”. The aforementioned insurance policies
_(or pension plans) are treated as earmarked assets as they are not owned by the Group but by an unrelated_
third party, they may only be used to pay or finance employee benefits and may not be returned to the Group
unless the assets held within the plan are sufficient to meet all obligations.

Changes in the provision recognised for these commitments in the consolidated statement of financial
position corresponding to the cost of the services during the current period or to interest, are taken to the
consolidated income statement in the financial year in which they are incurred, to the extent that “actuarial
profits and losses” _(that result from differences existing between previous actuarial assumptions and real_
_outcomes and changes to the actuarial assumptions used)_ are taken directly to equity as “Adjustments for
changes in value”.

**_n)_** **_Corporate income tax-_**

Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and practically all of its consolidated Spanish subsidiaries domiciled in Spanish
“common territory” in which it has direct or indirect holdings of 75% or more file consolidated corporate
income tax returns. Until 31 December 2014 the parent of the consolidated tax group was Grupo AntolinIrausa, S.A.U. Since 1 January 2015 the parent of the consolidated tax group under which these companies
file has been Avot Inversiones, S.L., the Group's indirect shareholder (see Notes 1, 13 and 19).

The income tax expense is calculated as the tax payable with respect to the taxable profit for the year, after
considering any changes in the assets and liabilities recognised arising from timing differences and from tax
credit and tax loss carryforwards (see Note 19).

The Group considers that a timing difference exists when there is a difference between the book value of an
asset or liability and its tax base. The tax base for assets and liabilities is treated as the amount attributed to
it for tax purposes. A taxable timing difference is understood to be a difference that will generate a future
obligation for the Group to pay taxes to the relevant tax authorities. A deductible timing difference is one that
will generate a right for the Group to a refund or to make a lower payment to the relevant tax authorities in
the future.

Tax credits and deductions and tax loss carryforwards are amounts that, after performance of the activity or
generation of the profit or loss giving entitlement to them, are not used for tax purposes in the related tax
return until the conditions for doing so established in tax regulations are met, provided that the Group
considers it probable that they will be used in future periods


-----

Current tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the
related tax authorities within twelve months from the date they are recognised. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are those amounts that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the relevant tax
authorities in future years.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences. In this regard, a deferred tax liability
is recognised for the taxable timing differences resulting from investments in subsidiaries and associate
companies, and from holdings in joint ventures, except when the Group can control the reversal of the timing
differences and they are not expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future.

The consolidated companies only recognise deferred tax assets arising from deductible timing differences and
from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that they will have sufficient future
taxable profits against which these assets can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or
liability (other than in a business combination) that at the time of recognition affects neither accounting profit
nor taxable profit.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are reassessed each year in order to ascertain whether they
still exist, and the appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed.

_Tax uncertainties-_

If the Group determines that it is not likely that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment or a
group of uncertain tax treatments, it considers that uncertainty in determining taxable income, tax bases, tax
loss carryforwards, deductions or tax rates. The Group determines the effect of the uncertainty in the
corporate income tax return by the expected value method, when the range of possible outcomes is highly
disperse or the most probable outcome method, when the outcome is binary or concentrated around one
amount. In those cases in which the tax asset or liability calculated with these criteria exceeds the selfassessed amount, it is presented as current or non-current in the consolidated statement of financial position
according to the expected recovery or settlement date and considering, where appropriate, the amount of
any corresponding default interest on the liability as it accrues in the income statement. The Group records
changes in events and circumstances on tax uncertainties as a change in estimate.

The Group recognises and presents penalties in keeping with the accounting policy for provisions.

_Offset and classification-_

The Group only offsets tax assets and liabilities on current income tax if a legal right exists vis-à-vis the tax
authorities and it intends to settle any resulting debts at its net amount, or realise the assets and settle the
debts simultaneously.

The Group only offsets tax assets and liabilities on deferred income tax if a legal offset right exists vis-à-vis the
tax authorities and those assets and liabilities correspond to the same tax authority, and to the same taxpayer
or to different taxpayers that seek to settle or realise the current tax assets and liabilities at their net amount
or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each one of the future tax periods in which
they expect to settle or recover significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as noncurrent assets or liabilities, regardless of the anticipated date of realisation or settlement.

**_o)_** **_Recognition of income and expense-_**

i) Recognition of revenue from customer contracts


-----

Revenue from customer contracts is recognised based on fulfilment of the performance obligations with those
customers.

Ordinary revenue represents the transfer of goods or services promised to customers for an amount that
reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to have a right in exchange for those goods and
services.

Five steps are established for the recognition of revenue:

─ Identify the customer contract/s.

─ Identify the performance obligations.

─ Determine the transaction price.

─ Assign the transaction price to the various performance obligations.

─ Recognise the revenue according to fulfilment of each obligation.

On the basis of this recognition model, sales of goods are recognised when the products are delivered to the
customer and the customer accepts them, even if they have not yet been invoiced or, if applicable, the
services have been rendered and it is reasonably assured that the corresponding receivable will be collected.

Expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, immediately in the case of outlays that are not going to generate
future financial profits or when they fail to comply with the necessary requirements for asset recognition.

Income and expenses are taken to the consolidated income statement on an accrual basis.

❖
Revenues on sales of assets are recognised when control of the assets is transferred, which generally

occurs when the assets are delivered (sent to the customer's specific location).

The Group engages in the manufacture and sale of parts for the automotive sector. While the parts are
exclusively designed and manufactured for the customers and have no alternative uses for the Group,
revenue is recognised when control over them is transferred and not over time, since the Group does not
have an unconditional collection right for the execution performed at the close of each year.

❖
Revenues on the sale of project tools. To be able to specifically manufacture the parts for customers, the

Group incurs costs for mould design and manufacture. Once manufactured and approved by the
customers, the moulds become customer property and the contracts indicate a separate price for these.
To recognise this revenue, the Group follows the criteria under “Net Turnover” in the consolidated income
statement, when control of the tools is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs when they pass
the corresponding technical certification or verification by the customer. The Company's Directors
consider that even when the tools made for customers have no alternative use for the Group, in the event
that the order is rescinded by the customer, the Group has no right to receive payment for performance
until that date, given that it would only have the right to collect the costs incurred but not to a reasonable
profit margin. For this reason, tool manufacture is recorded as a performance obligation satisfied at a
specific moment.

Amounts billed in advance by the Group until control of these tools has been transferred are recorded as
a liability under “Trade and other payables” on the consolidated statement of financial position.

Moreover, any final losses expected to be sustained on tools are recognised in full when such a loss
becomes apparent, and the related provisions are recognised under this heading in the consolidated
income statement.


-----

ii) Recognition of other revenue

❖
Ordinary revenue from the provision of services is recognised in line with the stage of completion of the

transaction as at the end of the reporting period.

❖
Rental income is recorded on an accrual basis, with incentive benefits and the up-front costs of the lease

agreements released on a straight-line basis.

❖
Capital grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as deferred income when

the Group has met the relevant qualifying conditions and there are, therefore, no reasonable doubts
about their being collected. These capital grants are taken to the consolidated income statement under
“Capital grants and other grants taken to income” on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the
assets.

Government grants to cover or finance expenses incurred by the Group are recognised once all the
conditions attaching to them have been fulfilled and will be taken to income when the financed expenses
are incurred.

❖
Interest income and expense is recognised on an accrual basis using the “effective interest rate method”.

❖
Dividends received from other companies are recognised as income in the income statement when the

consolidated companies' right to receive them arises.

An expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement when there is a decrease in the future
economic benefits related to a reduction of an asset, or an increase in a liability, which can be measured
reliably. This means that the recognition of an expense takes place simultaneously with the recognition of the
increase in the liability or the depletion of the asset.

An expense is recognised immediately when a disbursement does not give rise to future economic benefits or
when the requirements for recognition as an asset are not met.

An expense is also recognised when a liability is incurred and no asset is recognised, as in the case of a liability
relating to a guarantee.

**_p)_** **_Classification of assets and liabilities as current-_**

In the consolidated statement of financial position, assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered,
consumed or settled in twelve months or less, from the end of the reporting period, are classified as current,
except for project tools, which are recorded as “Inventories” under “Current assets” in the consolidated
statement of financial position, as they are expected to be realised in the normal course of the Group's
business (as part of its normal operating cycle), and the liabilities connected with said inventories (customer
_advances) which are recognised under “Current liabilities” in the consolidated statement of financial position,_
regardless of when they fall due. When the Group does not have an unconditional right by the year-end to
defer settlement of a liability for at least twelve months from the date of the consolidated statement of
financial position, the liability is recorded as current.

**_q)_** **_Discontinued operations-_**

A discontinued operation is a line of business that is to be abandoned and/or sold whose assets, liabilities and
net profit or loss can be distinguished physically, operationally and for financial reporting purposes. Revenues
and expenses from discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.

No line of business or business segment was discontinued in 2021.

In 2022 the business activities of the Group’s subsidiaries in Russia were discontinued In this connection as


-----

and Russia on the Group’s business in Russia, for management purposes a specific geographical segment was
created for the Russian market, which was effective from 1 January 2022. Subsequently, in the last months of
2022 as a result of the continuation of the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the fact that it
was impossible for the Group’s two industrial subsidiaries in Russia _(Grupo Antolin-Saint Petersburg and_
_Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Nóvgorod, Ltd.) to continue operating, the Group decided to discontinue its_
_business activities in Russia and launched a plan to sell these companies that comprise the “Russian” market_
_segment, which were classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for 2022_
_(see Note 25). For this reason, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries at 31 December 2022 were fully_
consolidated, but were recognised under “Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale” and “Liabilities
Associated with Non-Current Assets Classified as Held for Sale” in the consolidated statement of financial
position, and the related income and expenses were included in the accompanying consolidated income
statement for 2022 separately under a single heading, “Profit/(Loss) for the Year from Discontinued
Operations, Net of Taxes”.

In accordance with the accounting legislation in force, the Group should have changed the comparative
figures in the consolidated income statement for 2021, and recognised the net result after tax of the
discontinued business unit in a single amount. It should also have changed the comparative figures of the
consolidated statement of cash flows for 2021, and reported the net change in cash and cash equivalents
arising from the discontinued business activities in a single amount. However, since the effects of this
reporting are immaterial with respect to the consolidated financial statements as a whole, the Group decided
to maintain the presentation of the income and expenses, and cash inflows and outflows, of these subsidiaries
in 2021, in accordance with their nature, and as they were recognised in the consolidated financial statements
for 2021 without restating them.

**_r)_** **_Consolidated statement of cash flows-_**

The consolidated statement of cash flows is prepared according to the indirect method using the following
terms with the meanings given below:

  - Cash flows: inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents, the latter being short-term, highly liquid
investments subject to low risk of changes in value.

  - Operating activities: the typical activities of companies in the motor parts industry and other activities
that cannot be classified as investing or financing activities.

  - Investment activities: the acquisition, sale or disposal by other means of non-current assets and other
investments not classified as cash and cash equivalents.

  - Financing activities: activities that result in changes in the size and composition of equity and liabilities
that are not part of operating activities.

For the purposes of preparing the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include
cash and demand deposits at banks and highly liquid current investments which are easily convertible into
determinate cash amounts and are subject to insignificant risk as regards changes in value.

A reconciliation of the book value of the liabilities originated by financing activities, distinguishing between
the changes that give rise to cash flows due to “Proceeds from/(payments for) financial liabilities” (which are
_recognised under “Cash flows from/(used in) financing activities” in the accompanying consolidated statement_
_of cash flows for 2022 and 2021) and those that do not, is given below:_

**(4)** **ALLOCATION OF THE PARENT'S LOSS**

The Parent's proposal for allocation of the loss in 2022, as formulated by its Directors, as well as the application of
the loss in 2021 by the Parent approved by its Sole Shareholder on 28 June 2022 is indicated below:

**(5)** **BUSINESS COMBINATIONS**

No significant business combinations were carried out in 2022.

As indicated in Note 2-g, in July 2022 the Group acquired a 51% stake in the share capital of Dongfeng Antolin
(Wuhan) Automotive Trim Co., Ltd. for a price of practically zero. As a result of this operation, the Group now owns
100% of the share capital of this company (at 31 December 2021 it owned 49%), and now controls it.

The assets and liabilities of Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan) Automotive Trim Co., Ltd. recognised at the acquisition
date, which have been measured at fair value, and their amounts, were not significant with respect to the
consolidated financial statements as a whole.

The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in these business combinations do not significantly differ from
the values at which they were carried in the books of the mentioned company when the business was combined.
The contingent liabilities of this company have been guaranteed by the seller.

As a consequence of the recognition of the aforementioned assets and liabilities, goodwill has been generated in
amounts of 160 thousand euros, recorded under the consolidated statement of financial position heading
“Intangible assets-Goodwill” (see Note 7).

No business combinations were carried out in 2021.

**(6)** **INFORMATION BY SEGMENT**

The information by segment used by Group Management for management purposes is structured on the basis of
the Group's different business units, and also by geographical segments.

In each business unit the production plants are grouped in accordance with the specific product or activity, rather
than in accordance with the main activity of the company to which each plant belongs. This business unit or
segment structure is focused on the production and development of each type of product and will allow the
operations of the businesses to be managed more efficiently. The main business units or segments of Grupo
Antolin are the following three, defined taking into account the nature of the products: “Overheads & Soft Trim”,
“Doors & Cockpits” and “Lighting”. Moreover, approval was given in the later months of 2019 to establish a new
“Electronic Systems” business unit, that has been fully operational since 2021 from a management perspective
_(part of the “Lighting” business unit)._

Until 2021 the “Doors & Hard Trim” and “Cockpits & Consoles” segments were managed and presented separately,
and in 2022 they were included in a single business unit. Moreover, in 2022 the subsidiaries Grupo Antolin-Dapsa,
S.A.U. and Grupo Antolin-Plasbur, S.A.U. were taken from the other segments in which they were included until
2021 to the “Lighting” segment.

In addition, in order to prevent the distortion of the analysis of the performance of the industrial and geographical
segments, a segment entitled “Other” has been defined, which includes the “Corporate Unit” that carries out the
_global management of certain assets and the financing received by the Group from third parties, as well as other_
_minor activities, the consolidation adjustments and, from 2022, the Technical-Commercial Offices (TCOs) expenses._

Also, the geographical segments defined by the group are: “Asia-Pacific”, “Europe”, “Mercosur”, “NAFTA” and
“Africa”. In 2022, in view of the continuation of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, a decision was
taken to specifically monitor the Russian market and separate management information was prepared on the
“Russia” segment. Subsequently, in the last months of 2022, a decision was taken to discontinue the business
activities of this geographical segment. Also, as indicated in the previous paragraph, a new geographical segment
entitled “Other” was defined.

As a result of the changes in the segment reporting carried out in 2022, the segment information included in this
Note was adapted in 2021 to make it comparable to the information for 2022 and, therefore, it differs from the
information reported in the consolidated financial statements for 2021.

**Basis and methodology for segment reporting-**

The business segment reports below are based on monthly reports prepared by Group Management, which are
generated using the same computer application as is used to obtain all the Group's accounting data. This
information includes the segments of the discontinued operations. The segment reporting for 2022 does not
include the “Russia” geographical segment, which was classified under “Discontinued Business Activities”. The
information on this segment is included in Note 25.

The revenues reported for each segment are those which are directly attributable to the production plants
included in that segment for management purposes, so these also include secondary revenues that said plants
may have obtained from sales or the provision of services to other segments. The revenue of each segment does
not include interest or dividend income or the gains on sales of investments or of non-current assets.

The expenses of each segment are calculated as being the expenses arising out of the operating activities of the
segment that may be directly attributed to the plants included in that segment for management purposes. In this
respect, with effect from 1 January 2017, the model for the allocation of head office and structural Corporate Unit
costs among the various group companies and business segments has been modified, and for the purposes of
management information, the monitoring of the performance of the segments is carried out without taking into
account these overheads. Accordingly, these costs are presented in the segment information as corresponding to
the “Corporate Unit”. The expenses of each segment do not include interest expense, impairment or losses on
sales of investments or of non-current assets.

Assets and liabilities in the segments are those that are directly connected with the operations of the plants in
each segment, although virtually all of the financial debt of the Group has been centralised in the Corporate Unit.

_Impairment tests-_

At the end of each reporting period, the Group estimates whether there has been any impairment that reduces
the recoverable value of goodwill to less than its book value and makes any value adjustments necessary. The
policies applied by the Group to test for impairment to goodwill are described in Note 3-b.

In this respect, at 31 December 2022 the Group carried out the corresponding analyses, evaluating the recoverable
amount of the cash generating units associated with goodwill _(substantially all of which corresponds to_
_consolidated subsidiaries which are currently generating profits or are expected to do so in coming years as certain_
_projects are launched) by reference to the fair value less costs to sell, calculated on the basis of cash flow_
projections that represent best estimates, covering a period of five years and with a terminal value estimated
assuming a perpetuity growth rate. To determine the recoverable amounts, at the close of 2022 the Group's
Directors reviewed and updated the assumptions relating to the future activities and forecast results of the
corresponding businesses and their impact on cash flows, and the performance of the main variables foreseen in
the budgets approved for 2023 and the business plans _(approved by the Board of Directors)._ The fair value
hierarchy according to IFRS 13, in which fair value measurement was classified in its entirety, was Level 3, without
considering whether the costs of sale or disposable by any other means are observable.

The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of this impairment test varies from country to country and
ranges from 8.50% (for some businesses in Western Europe and the US) to 18% (for businesses in Argentina, Russia
_and Turkey), while in 2021 this range was at levels between 7.5% and 12%. The terminal value is calculated_
assuming sustainable average cash flows and a forecast growth rate of 1%.

The conclusion drawn by the Group from this analysis is that the recoverable value of its goodwill is greater than
the book value recorded.

Group Management has also performed a sensitivity analysis and estimates that, even if the anticipated growth in
sales is not achieved (and current levels are maintained) and/or the discount rates increase, no risks of impairment
are foreseen. The main assumptions used were a 0.5% increase in the discount rate and a 0.5% reduction in the
perpetuity growth rate.

most of the development projects under way at 31 December 2022 will be completed, at which time the
corresponding products will go into mass production.

The main additions of development expenses in 2022 correspond to the Renault “XHN Kadjar EUR 21
Panel+Plastic”, “Human Horizons IP”, BMW “U06 Lighting”, Mini “F56 Lighting” Renault “Kadjar Headliner” and
Renault “BCB Headliner” projects. Mass production for some of these projects began in 2022.

Development costs derecognised in 2022 correspond principally to development costs for certain projects which
were almost fully amortised and/or impaired. As a result of these derecognitions, the Group recognised a net loss
of 424 thousand euros in 2022 under “Profit/(loss) on the disposal of non-current assets” in the attached
consolidated income statement (2.6 million euros in 2021).

_Other intangible assets-_

At 31 December 2022, the balance of this heading basically corresponds to customer relations recognised in 2015
in the business combination of the interior components business unit of the international Magna Automotive
Group, which will be amortised over periods of between 2 and 7 years; and to certain considerations paid by the
Group to customers for being awarded and securing contracts to produce and supply parts and components for
these customers' projects. These incremental costs of securing orders or contracts were capitalised as it is deemed
likely that profits or economic benefits will be obtained from the production and sale of the corresponding parts
and components, enabling these costs to be recovered.

No individual intangible assets exist that are significant in the entity's financial statements.

_Impairment losses-_

Intangible assets not available for use are subject to annual impairment tests in keeping with IAS 36. In this regard,
at 31 December 2022, the Group analysed asset recoverability at individual project level and production plant, on
the basis of the technical and financial viability of the projects under development, using the fair value less costs
to sell method.

In addition, at the end of every reporting period, the Group reviews the book values of its intangible assets to
determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss. Should any such
signs of impairment exist, the recoverable amount of these assets is determined in order to quantify any
impairment loss suffered. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit associated with these intangible
assets was measured by reference to its value in use which was calculated based on best estimates of cash flows
over the life of the corresponding project. The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of these impairment
tests is between 8.5% and 18%, depending on the country.

In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual
growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in
use. This analysis did lead to the conclusion that there was no significant risk of impairment. The main assumptions
used were a 0.5% increase in the discount rate and a 0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate.

The Group estimates a 10% increase in turnover with respect to 2022 due to the recovery of the activity in Nafta,
and to the positive evolution of the Chinese market, a higher margin on sales of between 7.5%- and 8%, as a result
of the improvement initiatives applied, optimisation programmes implemented and the decrease in fixed and
variable costs arising from the digitalisation and standardisation efficiency programme implemented in recent
years.

Accordingly, at 31 December 2022, the Group recorded provisions for impairment totalling 138,042 thousand
euros _(76,351 thousand at 31 December 2021), corresponding to a decrease in the value of the development_
expenses and other intangible assets for certain projects which are currently loss-making, and for which the
recoverable value is lower than their book value. Approximately 85,025 thousand euros of this amount was
recognised under "Net impairment loss on non-current assets" in the accompanying consolidated income
statement for 2022 _(approximately 16,332 thousand euros in 2021). No impairment provisions were reversed_
against this heading of the consolidated income statement for 2022 (328 thousand euros in 2021)


-----

_Fully amortised assets-_

The Group's intangible assets include certain assets which had been fully amortised at 31 December 2022 and
2021. The total cost and related accumulated amortisation of these assets amounted to 277 and 253 million euros,
respectively.

Kentucky, Inc. (United States), Grupo Antolin-Bamberg, GmbH & Co. KG (Germany), Grupo Antolin-Sibiu, S.R.L.
(Rumania), Antolin Interiors México, S.A. de C.V. (Mexico) and in the Howell plant, owned by Antolin Interiors USA,
Inc.

The main additions to the Group's property, plant and equipment in 2021 corresponded to investments to extend
production facilities, some of which were in progress at 31 December 2021, and those undertaken by Antolin
Süddeutschland, GmbH, Antolin Bohemia, a.s., Grupo Antolin-Kentucky, Inc. and Antolin Interiors México, S.A. de
C.V. are worthy of mention.

The most significant derecognitions in 2022 correspond to the derecognition of property, plant and equipment of
Chongqing Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hanzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and
Antolin Spartanburg Assembly, Inc., which were excluded from the scope of consolidation during the period (see
Note 3); and to the recognition of retirements of machinery and other items of other plants, most of which had
been fully depreciated and were not in productive use by the companies.

The Group recognised a scantly material losses in 2022 (834 thousand euros) as a result of these retirements, which
was taken to income under “Gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets” in the accompanying consolidated
income statement _(in 2021 gains on disposal and derecognition of property, plant and equipment totalled 3.5_
_million euros)._

On the other hand, in 2022 the Group sold land located in Burgos, which was recognised under “Investment
property” in the consolidated statement of financial position. On this transaction, the Group obtained a loss of
approximately 0.6 million euros, which was taken to income under "Gains or losses on disposals of non-current
assets" in the accompanying consolidated income statement.

The most significant derecognitions in 2021 corresponded to removals and disposals recorded in relation to
machinery and other items of plant basically located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Czech
Republic and Austria. Also, in 2021 the Group sold a building located in Almussafes (Valencia), that also was
recognized under “Investment property”. On this transaction, the Group obtained a gain of approximately 4.3
million euros

**Land-**

The cost of "Land and constructions" at 31 December 2022 and 2021 includes 34,926 and 34,745 thousand euros,
respectively, corresponding to the carrying amount of the land at those dates.

The Group's land holdings in the Iberian Peninsula were stated at their fair value at the date of transition to IFRSEU (1 January 2006) in accordance with the stipulations of IFRS 1. The highest value attributed to said assets at 31
December 2022 and 2021 was 16,187 thousand euros (corresponding to property, plant and equipment and the
_rest to investment properties) and was determined on the basis of valuations performed by independent experts_
based on market prices or estimated discounted future cash flows.

**Investment budget for 2023-**

In 2023 the Group's Directors plan to invest 118,317 thousand euros in property, plant and equipment as broken
down below:

of calculations and are net of the effect of exclusions of companies from the scope of consolidation (see Note 2g), and of the reclassification to “Non-current assets held for sale” of the Russian companies (see Note 25).

The discount rate used at 31 December 2022 and 2021 to determine the present value of lease liabilities at those
dates generally ranged between 0.75% and 5%, depending on each company's financial position and its financing
cost, although it was higher in some countries, such as Vietnam (7.25%). The overall average rate was around
2.68% (overall average rate of 2.91% in 2021).

**Finance leases (leasing)-**

The detail of the leased assets recognised by the Group, as the lessee under finance leases at 31 December 2022
and 2021 _(valued in accordance with the criterion described in Note 3-f), and of their key features and the_
corresponding finance leases signed, is as follows(see Note 17):

**Operating leases-**

Some of the consolidated companies lease buildings which house a part of their warehouses, production facilities
and offices, as well as machinery, vehicles and other PP&E. As indicated in Note 3-f, IFRS 16 Leases was applied
when recognising the corresponding leases executed with the owners of these assets in the annual consolidated
financial statements.

In addition to recognising the aforementioned leases in accordance with IFRS 16, Grupo Antolin benefits from the
exceptions set out in IFRS 16 for contracts classified as “low value leases” (under 6,000 euros, equivalent to 5,000
_US dollars), for long and short-term contracts, and for short-term contracts even when the leases are not low value._

The lease expense of these leases of low-value or short-term contracts in 2022 totalled 17,791 thousand euros,
and was recognised under “Other operating expenses” in the accompanying consolidated income statement (see
Note 20).

At 31 December 2022, the leases of low-value and short-term operating lease agreements the Group was party to
at that date gave rise to the following future lease payments to lessors falling due as shown:

than the book value. If so, the book value is reduced to the recoverable value and the future charges for
depreciation are adjusted in proportion to their adjusted book value and the new remaining useful life if it was
also necessary to re-estimate this. Any such reduction in the book value of property, plant and equipment for own
use is charged to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement.

Similarly, whenever there are signs that the value of an impaired asset has recovered, the consolidated companies
reverse impairment losses recognised in prior years. The increased book value may not exceed the book value that
would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset.

In this regard, at 31 December 2022 the Group's consolidated companies tested for signs of impairment of their
property, plant and equipment, at the level of each project to which those assets and at production plant level are
assigned and if impairment was identified, they proceeded to quantify their recoverable amount. Where the asset
does not itself generate cash inflows that are independent of those from other assets, the Group estimates the
recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value (less sale costs) and its value in use. In calculating value
in use at 31 December 2022, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. These future cash flows are derived
from the forecasts made by the Group for each cash generating unit for a period of five years (using assumptions
_concerning changes in sale prices, costs and volumes based on experience and future expectations in accordance_
_with the currently approved strategic plan and the budget for the coming year), with a residual value calculated_
using a growth rate of 1%. The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of these impairment tests is between
8.5% and 18%, depending on the country.

In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual
growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in
use. This analysis did not lead to the conclusion that there was any risk of impairment. The main assumptions used
were a 0.5% increase in the discount rate and a 0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate.

The Group estimates a 10% increase in turnover with respect to 2022 due to the recovery of the activity in Europe
and Nafta and to the positive evolution of the Chinese market, a higher margin on sales between 7.5%-8%, resulting
from the improvement initiatives applied, optimisation programmes implemented and the decrease in fixed and
variable costs derived from the digitalisation and standardisation efficiency programme implemented in 2019 and
2020.

Based on this analysis, at 31 December 2022 the Group recognised impairment losses on property, plant and
equipment totalling 62,683 thousand euros (of which _a net amount of 59,547 thousand euros were recognised in_
_2022, 3,704 thousand euros in 2021 and the rest in years prior to 2021). These losses basically correspond to the_
loss of property, plant and equipment at the plants owned by Grupo Antolin-Kentucky, Inc., Grupo AntolinMichigan, Inc., Antolin Interiors UK, Ltd., Antolin Ebergassing, GmbH, Trimtec, Ltda., Iramec Autopeças, Ltda. and
Grupo Antolin Bratislava, s.r.o. for projects that are currently generating losses or have done so in the past and
whose recoverable amount is below their book value (at 31 December 2021 the Group had recognised impairments
_in the amount of 30,362 thousand euros)._

**Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment-**

The Group's property, plant and equipment include certain assets which had been fully depreciated at 31
December 2022 and 2021. The total cost and related accumulated depreciation of these assets amounted to 712
and 728 million euros, respectively.

**Insurance policy-**

The Group takes out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which its property, plant and equipment are
exposed. The Parent's Directors consider that the policies taken out are adequate in view of the various locations
of its property, plant and equipment.

**(9)** **NON-CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OTHER CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS**

The balances under these headings in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 and
2021 are broken down below by type:

**Net total** **7,859** **3,641** **6,551** **4,635**

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the fair value of these assets does not differ significantly from their book value.
Grupo Antolin financial assets measured at fair value are at level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

**Non-current investment securities-**

The balances of this item at 31 December 2022 and 2021 correspond to several minority interests in non-listed
companies.

**Other financial assets-**

_Non-current receivables from group companies_

The balances under this non-current assets’ heading at 31 December 2022 and 2021 include the balance receivable
of the long-term cash-pooling account held by the Parent with Avot Inversiones, S.L., which matures on 31
December 2024 and 2023, respectively, and bears annual interest at a variable market rate which is revised
annually (see Note 22).

_Other financial assets_

In February 2020, the Group and Eyesight Mobile Technologies, Ltd. (an Israeli company that is a leader in in-car
_vision technology using artificial intelligence and currently called CIPIA)_ signed a Simple Agreement for Future
Equity (“SAFE”), under which this supplier will supply the Group and work with it to develop driver and passenger
monitoring systems. Pursuant to the agreement, in 2020 the Group paid an amount equivalent to 2,780 thousand
euros, which it is planned will be transformed into a convertible loan and, subsequently, into a minority equity
stake in this Israeli company. This is dependent on certain conditions being met and the occurrence of certain
events, which was not the case at the end of 2021. Consequently, at 31 December 2022 this consideration is
recognised as “Other financial assets-Deposits and guarantees given” under “Non-current assets” in the
accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at that date, given the intended long-term relationship
with this third party and any resulting investment, as the case may be.

**(10)** **INVENTORIES**

The Group's inventories at 31 December 2022 and 2021 were as follows:

**621,449** **548,409**

**Project tools-**

The balances of this item at 31 December 2022 and 2021 correspond to the costs incurred by the Group on the
project tools being manufactured at said dates. At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group had billed to pertinent
customers approximately 166 and 132 million euros, respectively, as advances, which are recorded as current
liabilities under the “Trade and other payables” heading in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial
position.

The Directors of the Parent consider that the income in respect of the sale of practically all the project tools being
manufactured at 31 December 2022 will be realised in 2023.

**Insurance policy-**

The Group takes out insurance policies to cover the possible risks to which practically all its inventories are
exposed. In the opinion of the Parent's Directors, the cover provided by the policies taken out at 31 December
2022 is sufficient.

**(11)** **OTHER RECEIVABLES**

The composition of other receivables in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 and
2021 is as follows:

**(13)** **EQUITY**

**Share capital-**

The Parent's share capital at 31 December 2022 and 2021 comprised 8,023,241 registered shares (of a single class
_and series), with a par value of 4.67 euros, fully subscribed and paid up._

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, all the share capital of the Parent was held directly or indirectly by Avot
Inversiones, S.L. (parent of the Parent's current and previous shareholders), a company whose Registered offices
are in Burgos and whose owners are members of the Antolin family (see Note 1). All the Grupo Antolin-Irausa,
S.A.U. shares carry the same voting and dividend rights, although they are distinguished by their transfer regime.

At 31 December 2022, all Parent shares were pledged in guarantee of compliance with the obligations deriving
from the secured bonds issued in 2021 and 2018 by the Parent, as well as the financing agreement known as the
“Senior Facilities Agreement” that the Parent executed with several financial institutions, the loan granted by the
European Investment Bank (EIB) and a loan granted by the Compañía Española de Financiación del Desarrollo
(COFIDES), which adhered to the “Intercreditor Agreement”, that governs relations among the Group's financial
creditors (see Note 17).

**Additional paid-in capital-**

The revised text of the Spanish Corporate Enterprise Act expressly allows the use of the additional paid-in capital
balance to increase share capital and establishes no specific restrictions as to its use.

**Other reserves of the Parent-**

This heading in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 and 2021 includes the
following reserves:

_Legal reserve-_

The revised text of the Spanish Corporate Enterprise Act stipulates that 10% of the net profits of the year must be
appropriated to the legal reserve until it reaches at least 20% of share capital. At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the
legal reserve amounted to 7,494 thousand euros (equivalent to 20% of the Parent's share capital).

The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below
10% of the increased share capital amount. Otherwise, whereas the legal reserve does not exceed 20% of share
capital, it can only be used to offset losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this purpose.

_Capitalisation reserve-_

The Parent's “Capitalisation reserve” at 31 December 2022 and 2021 amounted to 5,800 thousand euros. This
reserve was established in compliance with Law 27/2014, of 27 November, on Corporate Income Tax and is
restricted for 5 years from the end of the year to which the reduction in the final taxable income for corporate
income tax corresponds _(consequently, 2,000 thousand euros are restricted until 31 December 2022 and 2,000_
_thousand euros are restricted until 31 December 2021, while 1,800 thousand euros are no longer restricted as of_
_31 December 2020). The amount matches that by which the final tax base applied was reduced for this item in the_
Spanish consolidated tax group's corporate income tax return for 2015, 2016 and 2017.

_Other reserves-_

The balance under this heading at 31 December 2022 includes losses carried forward from previous financial years
_(258,057 thousand euros) and other unrestricted reserves of the Parent._


-----

**Distribution of dividends-**

_Dividends distributed in 2022 and 2021-_

The Parent did not distribute any dividends to its sole shareholder in 2022.

On 20 July 2021, the Parent's Sole Shareholder resolved to distribute a dividend against unrestricted reserves
amounting to 12,000 thousand euros.

_Restrictions on the distribution of dividends-_

As indicated in Note 17, on 21 March 2014 the Parent executed a “Senior Facility Agreement” with major Spanish
and international financial institutions, which has been successively amended and novated; the last novation of
which took place in December 2021. Under this agreement, the Group obtained financing by means of a syndicated
loan (“Loan Facility”) (whose outstanding balance at 31 December 2022 was 369.587 thousand euros) and a multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility with an initial limit of 200 million euros (193,550 thousand euros at 31 December
_2022). In addition, an “Intercreditor Agreement” was executed to govern relations among creditors: bond holders,_
financial entities, the European Investment Bank (EIB), which adhered in 2018, and the Compañía Española de
Financiación de Desarrollo (COFIDES), which adhered in 2021 as a result of the financing granted to the Group.
These financing agreements allow the distribution of dividends provided certain requirements are met. These
include:

  - _If the Group's debt-equity ratio is less than 3.50 but higher than 2.50, the dividends distributed may not_
_exceed 25% of its consolidated net profit._

  - _If the Group's debt-equity ratio is less than 2.50, the dividends distributed may not exceed 50% of its_
_consolidated net profit._

**Capital management-**

The Group's capital management focuses on achieving a financial structure that optimises the cost of capital to
ensure a sound financial position. This policy enables value creation for shareholders to be compatible with access
to financial markets at a competitive cost to cover the needs for refinancing debt and financing the investment
plan not covered by the funds generated by the business.

In this regard, in line with standard practice in the business world and in the industry in which it operates, the
Group uses the following ratios to analyse its situation:

- Financial leverage (Net borrowing/net equity attributable to the Parent): The Group's ratio at 31 December
2021 was 1.52. At the end of 2022, it was 2.23.

- Debt-to-income (Net borrowing/EBITDA): The Group's ratio at 31 December 2021 was 3.51. At the end of 2022,
it was 3.46 taking into account the one-off adjustment and the synergies associated with the transformation
plan (3.66 if the aforementioned adjustments are not taken into account).

- Interest coverage (EBITDA/Net Finance Income): The Group's ratio at 31 December 2021 was 6.46. At the end
of 2022, it was 6,53 taking into account the one-off adjustment and the synergies associated with the
transformation plan (6.16 if the aforementioned adjustments are not taken into account).

As stated in Note 17, the Group has been granted loans by third parties, which require that certain specific financial
ratios be fulfilled.

(a) Many of these companies were effected in 2021 by the negative impact of the global economic situation. In recent financial years the

Group has implemented an efficiency programme and measures to improve the performance of some of these consolidated subsidiaries
with the medium-term goal of reversing the trend for recurring losses. This is being achieved in some cases. Others are starting up their
activities, expanding their installations or launching new projects.

**(14)** **EARNINGS PER SHARE**

**Basic earnings/(loss) per share-**

Basic earnings/(loss) per share are calculated by dividing the net profit attributed to the holders of equity
instruments in the Parent by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during that year, excluding the
average number of treasury shares held during the year.

An analysis of basic earnings/(loss) per share is as follows:

Thousands of Euros
2022 2021

Earnings/(loss) for the year attributed to holders of net equity instruments in

the Parent (thousand euros) (225,562) (84,313)
Weighted average number of shares outstanding in the year (thousand

_shares)_ 8,023 8,023

**Basic earnings/(loss) per share (euros)** **(28.11)** **(10.51)**

The weighted average number of shares outstanding at 31 December 2022 and 2021 was 8,023,241.

**Diluted earnings/(loss) per share-**

Diluted earnings/(loss) per share are calculated in much the same way as basic earnings per share, but the
weighted average number of shares outstanding is adjusted to take into account the potential diluting effect of
the share options, warrants and convertible debt current at the year-end.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, diluted earnings/(loss) per share were the same as basic earnings/(loss) per share
as the Group had no diluting instruments.

**Balances at 31 December 2022** **23,143** **71,093** **94,236** **46,677**

**Provisions for pension commitments and similar-**

The balance of this heading at 31 December 2022 corresponds basically to provisions to meet long-term
commitments to personnel (pension commitments to certain current and former employees) in the British, French
and German companies belonging to the “Lighting” business and other German, Austrian, Mexican and Indian
companies. Some of these companies have outsourced their pension liabilities to an insurance company.

The amounts recognised in the consolidated statements of financial position at 31 December 2022 and 2021 were
determined as follows:

Thousands of Euros
31/12/22 31/12/21

Present value of the obligations at the end of the reporting period 37,442 43,492
Fair value of the assets assigned to the plan at the end of the reporting period (14,299) (17,260)

**Liability in the consolidated statement of financial position at the end of the**

**reporting period** **23,143** **26,232**

These amounts have been calculated using appropriate actuarial studies. The technical assumptions applied by the
consolidated subsidiaries (interest rates, mortality tables, accumulated annual CPI, etc.) are in line with the socioeconomic situation of each country (the discounted interest rates used at 31 December 2022 range from 1.10% to
_9.48% while at 2021 year-end they ranged from 0.60% to 7.28%)._

**Other provisions-**

The balance of other “Non-current provisions” at 31 December 2022 essentially comprises provisions set up to
meet commitments with the personnel of some of the consolidated companies in addition to those included under
“Provisions for pension commitments and similar” _(13,301 thousand euros), some claims by suppliers and/or_
customers for retroactive pricing and similar arrangements (15 485 thousand euros) future losses deriving from

**Syndicated loan (“Loan Facility”), and a multi-currency**
**Revolving Credit Facility-**

On 13 March 2014, the Parent signed a “Senior Facilities Agreement” with major Spanish and international financial
institutions under which the Group obtained financing by means of a 200-million-euro syndicated loan _(“Loan_
_Facility”), and a multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility with a 200-million-euro limit. Subsequently, in June 2015_
a 200-million-euro extension to the syndicated loan (“Loan Facility”) was agreed, increasing the capital of said loan
to 400 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent prior to 31 December 2015.

On 26 October 2016, the group signed a novation of the “Senior Facilities Agreement”, amending the repayment
schedule and extending the final maturity date of the contract to 2021 (originally this was 2020) and the interest
rate was modified (Euribor plus a market spread) thereby reducing the Group's finance costs.

Also, on 27 April 2018, a change to the “Senior Facilities Agreement” (“Amendment and Restatement Agreement”)
was signed, increasing the syndicated loan by 50 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent in 2018. The
amount of the loan was 419,204 thousand euros and it was divided into three tranches. In this modification of the
loan a new financial entity became a new lender (HSBC Bank plc), the final maturity of the contract was extended
until 2023, and the repayment schedule was changed as was the interest rate, reducing the cost of this financing.

Additionally, on 3 June 2020 a new amendment of this financing agreement was executed, which allowed the
Group the possibility of additional financing in an aggregate amount of up to 200 million euros.

In 2021 the Parent completed a process to refinance the “Senior Facilities Agreement” _(“Amendment and_
_Restatement Agreement”)_ in order to extend the repayment schedule. In this loan amendment a new financial
entity was included as lender (Instituto de Crédito Oficial - ICO), the final maturity of the agreement was extended
through 2026 and the repayment schedule and applicable interest rate were modified. In accordance with IFRS 9
requirements, the Group assessed that the present value of the cash flows deducted under the new conditions,
using the original effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by less than 10% from the present discounted
value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. The Group calculated the differential amount of
the present value of the future contractual cash flows discounted at the debt's original effective interest rate with
respect to the amortised cost recorded without reaching a significant quantity for recognition in the annual
financial statements.

In relation to the multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, with the inclusion of the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO)
as lender, it was agreed to reduce the total available amount from 200 million euros (initially granted) to 193,550
thousand euros.

Lastly, in 2022 a new amendment to this financing agreement was executed, under which certain adjustments
were included in relation to the financial ratios which the Group is required to achieve, taking into account the
restructuring costs and the synergies included in the 2023-2026 Business plan.

During 2022 and 2021, the Group repaid 16,127 and 11,570 thousand euros, respectively, of these financing
agreements.

The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2022 and 2021 was 369,587 and 385,714
thousand euros, respectively, and so at those dates the Group had not drawn any amount against the multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2022 and 2021
has the following repayment schedule:

At 31/12/21 16,127 15,727 31,454 157,271 165,135 **385,714**

Notwithstanding the above schedule, the Group may, at any moment during the life of the loan, opt to repay all
or part of the outstanding syndicated loan or multi-currency revolving credit facility, provided certain conditions
are met. Furthermore, the following events will trigger full or partial early repayment of these loans:

- Subject to certain exceptions and amounts, the disposal of specific asset categories, the receipt of indemnities

from insurance companies or the flotation of the Parent (with no change of control of the Group).

- In the event of a change of control in the Group, any of the financial institutions may decide to leave the

financing arrangements in place or may request early repayment of the proportional part of the loan
corresponding to said institution.

_Interest-_

These loans accrue annual interest benchmarked to the Euribor, plus a variable market spread, that is reviewed
annually on the basis of certain financial ratios.

The Group must also pay a commission with respect to the undrawn amount of the multi-currency revolving credit
facility.

_Loan guarantees-_

These loans are backed by an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee from a significant number of the companies
forming Grupo Antolin, although the guarantees provided by some subsidiaries _(specifically certain Portuguese,_
_Czech, Austrian and German companies) are limited to amounts established by the applicable local legislation. In_
order to comply with the obligations related to these loans, the Group has given a commitment to each of the
subsidiaries in which it holds at least 90% of the share capital, that it will become a guarantor if any of the following
circumstances arises: its EBITDA for the year represents at least 2.5% of the Group's EBITDA and exceeds 5 million
euros.

In addition, liens have been established on the share capital of the Parent (see Note 13).

_Early repayment-_

The Senior Facilities Agreement under which these loans were ceded includes clauses specifying that the following
events will trigger its full early repayment:

- Failure to repay the principal or pay the interest on the loans as and when they fall due.

- Failure of the Group to meet the financial ratios set in the agreement under which these loans were ceded or

to remedy said failure within 20 days of the issue of the “ratio compliance certificate” in which it is detailed.

- Failure to comply with other obligations established in the loan agreement (false disclosures, failure to provide

_information, etc.) without rectifying said failure within a determined period._

- Failure to pay other borrowings falling due, provided certain circumstances are met, or the insolvency of the

Parent, a material subsidiary, or the shareholders.

- A change in the ownership of the shares of the Parent, or the cession of businesses, expropriation, lawsuits and

a material adverse effect on the Group. The loans will also be repayable if the Group's auditors issue a
disclaimer of opinion, or an adverse or qualified opinion.

At 31 December 2022, the Parent's Directors considered that all clauses and obligations set out in the financing
agreement and their subsequent amendments had been fulfilled, and that no grounds for early maturity or partial
or total early repayment had occurred. They also consider that all conditions will be met fulfilled in the following
12 months.

_Other obligations and commitments-_

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain obligations and commitments limiting the Group's capacity to
perform certain operations during the life of the loans, including the following:

- Limits on obtaining additional financing, the constitution of charges or guarantees against its assets, and the

granting of guarantees or sureties to third parties.

- Limits on the sale, cession, transfer or disposal of its assets.

- Limits on the acquisition of companies or businesses.

- Limits on the distribution of dividends by the Parent (see Note 13).

**Long-term loan granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB)-**

On 12 June 2018, the Parent and the European Investment Bank, and other group companies as guarantors, signed
a contract by which said entity granted the Group a long-term loan of 100,000 thousand euros, to finance a project
called “Antolin Car Interiors RDI”, implementing the Group's R&D and innovation strategy for the development of
new solutions for vehicle interiors. The total planned investment in the project is 217,172 thousand euros and
must be implemented by various group companies located in Spain, Germany and France between 2018 and 2020.

The principal is repaid in 14 half-yearly instalments of equal amounts, the first of which fell due on 30 November
2021 and the last on 31 May 2028.

On 23 December 2020, the Parent executed a new agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB), under
which it increased the amount of financing granted to the “Antolin Car Interiors RDI” project by 40,000 thousand
euros, and which had been drawn down by the Parent at 31 December 2021. The amount of this loan extension
will be repaid in half-yearly instalments, the first of which fells due on 31 January 2023 and the last one on 30 June
2028.

The Directors of the Parent foresee no difficulty renewing these credit lines when they expire.

Furthermore, since March 2014 the Group has a “Revolving Credit Facility” for an initial amount of 200 million
euros, which was decreased to 193,550 thousand euros in 2022, and which falls due on 30 June 2026. As a result,
at 31 December 2022 the undrawn amount available to the Group from credit lines and overdraft facilities totalled
269,622 thousand euros. These credit lines and overdraft facilities accrue interest at variable market rates.

**Factoring lines-**

At 31 December 2022, Grupo Antolin had executed recourse and non-recourse factoring agreements with several
financial entities. At that date outstanding receivables assigned without recourse to financial institutions
amounted to 122,605 thousand euros (84,628 thousand euros at 31 December 2021). As this involved transferring
part of the risks and benefits of the assets and control thereof, the Group directly reduced its trade receivables by
the amount of the receivables assigned to the financial institutions and did not, therefore, recognise any financial
liability in this connection. The limit of the factoring facilities at 31 December 2022 was 180,666 thousand euros.

In relation with these factoring agreements, at 31 December 2022 Grupo Antolin had 4,092 thousand euros
pending payment to financial institutions in respect of collections made by these in the final days of December
2022 regarding invoices ceded to these entities (1,636 thousand euros at 31 de December 2021). This amount,
which is included under liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December
2022 as payable to the corresponding entities, was paid in the first few days of 2023.

**Payables under finance leases-**

The lease payments outstanding at 31 December 2022 and 2021, including the purchase options, fall due as follows

**Loans granted by Spanish and Portuguese public authorities-**

Most of the balances under this heading at 31 December 2022 and 2021 corresponded to loans granted to Grupo
Antolin by certain Spanish public authorities to finance research and development projects and improve
competitiveness. In 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012, the Ministry for Industry, Tourism and Trade, through the Plan for
Competitiveness of the Motor Industry, granted long-term interest-free loans to Grupo Antolin. In general, these
loans must be repaid in 10 regular annual instalments falling due between 2015 and 2027.

The nominal amount of these and other loans granted by Spanish and Portuguese public authorities outstanding
at 31 December 2022 and 2021 (which are recorded at said dates at its amortised cost) will be repaid in accordance
with the following maturity schedule:

**Corporate income tax-**

As indicated in Note 3-p, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and all of its consolidated Spanish subsidiaries domiciled in
Spanish “common territory” in which it has holdings of 75% or more file consolidated corporate income tax returns.
The parent of the consolidated tax group under which these companies file is Avot Inversiones, S.L. _(until 31_
_December 2014 the parent of the consolidated tax group was Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.)._

The corporate income tax charge is calculated for each consolidated subsidiary based on accounting profit,
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which need not coincide with taxable
income, the latter being the tax base.

The reconciliation of consolidated accounting income to the expected tax base for corporate income tax purposes
for 2022 and 2021 is as follows:

**Consolidated taxable income** **90,273** **52,995**

(a) The most significant increases and decreases correspond to reversals of certain provisions and to other expenses

incurred, which the Group considers non-deductible (timing differences). 2022 also includes the adjustment for the
impairment of recognised tangible and intangible assets, and the change in tax legislation regarding the amortisation
of R&D expenditure, which applied to the consolidated companies in the United States.

from taxable income, deductions, withholdings and payments on account furnished by the Group's Spanish
companies to the 2022 consolidated income tax return (375 thousand euros at 31 December 2021 recorded under
_the same heading in the attached consolidated statement of financial position at that date)._

**Corporate income tax expense-**

The balances of the “Corporate income tax” heading in the consolidated income statement for the financial years
ended 31 December 2022 and 2021 were determined as follows:

Thousands of Euros
2022 2021

**Consolidated profit/(loss) for the year before taxes:**

(a) Corresponds to taxes paid in other countries on dividends, interest and other amounts paid to the Parent and other
consolidated subsidiaries for which said companies have made no deductions.

**Tax loss carryforwards-**

Although at 31 December 2022 some of the consolidated companies had significant tax loss carryforwards (around
_802 million euros in total), the consolidated statement of financial position at that date only includes a tax credit_
of 18,349 thousand euros relating to the tax effect of the tax loss carryforwards, the offsetting of which can
reasonably be expected to be applied (basically, they correspond to tax losses generated in 2009, 2011, 2012 and
_2021 by the Spanish consolidated tax group, and tax losses generated by French, Chinese and Mexican companies)._

Tax losses generated in a given year can be carried forward for offset against the taxable income of the immediately
following years, as established in the tax legislation of the countries in which the consolidated companies are
located.

**Foreign subsidiaries-**

At 31 December 2022, no dividend distributions had been proposed by foreign consolidated subsidiaries and
associates which were pending execution. Nevertheless, at that date it was envisaged that dividends would be
distributed by certain subsidiaries in the coming years with a charge to existing reserves or 2022 profits.
Consequently, and based on estimates made, at 31 December 2022 a deferred tax liability of 1,677 thousand euros
is recognised in this connection due to the tax effect these pay-outs would have on the Group. This deferred tax
liability has been charged to “Corporate income tax” in the accompanying consolidated income statement.

**Deferred tax assets and liabilities-**

The movements in the financial years ended 31 December 2021 and 2022 under “Deferred tax assets” and
“Deferred tax liabilities” in the consolidated statement of financial position were as follows:

|Col1|Thousands of Euros|Col3|

**Balances at 31 December 2022** **99,793** **40,443**

The aforementioned deferred tax assets have been recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position
because the Parent's Directors are reasonably sure that they will be recovered, based on recent forecasts of the
future tax bases of the consolidated subsidiaries. In this regard, Grupo Antolin's current business plan for the
coming years revised by the Parent's Board of Directors and prepared by the Group's Directors recently sees pretax profits being posted.

At 2022 year-end and on the attached consolidated statement of financial position, the Group has not recognised
deferred assets in respect of certain tax loss carryforwards of consolidated subsidiaries (in an approximate amount
_of 733 million euros), deductions pending application (totalling 57 million euros) or other timing differences, as it_
considers that its future recovery does not meet the requirements of probability provided in applicable accounting
standards and/or in the application of the principle of prudence, on the basis of the estimated tax projects aligned
with the Group's business plans.

The deferred tax assets recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 and
2021 were generated as follows:

**40,443** **65,807**

**Tax credits-**

The corporate income tax legislation in force provides for various tax incentives. The tax credits earned in one year
in excess of the applicable legal limits may be deducted from the corporate income tax payable in subsequent
years, up to the limits and within the periods established in this connection by the related tax regulations. The
Group has availed itself of the tax benefits provided for by this legislation and deducted 5,820 and 1,199 thousand
euros, respectively, from the consolidated corporate income tax charge for 2022 and 2021, for which the Group
had not recorded any tax credits for those applied in 2022 and 2021.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, after the aforementioned tax credits had been applied, certain foreign group
companies had unused deductions amounting to 11,740 and 4,956 thousand euros, respectively, while the Group's
Spanish subsidiaries had the following unused deductions:

Thousands of Euros
31/12/22 31/12/21

Deductions for research and development activities (a) 41,888 41,883
Other deductions 2,864 2,852

**44,752** **44,735**

(a) At 31 December 2022, these corresponded to deductions for R&D activities from 2004 to 2021,

inclusive, and can be applied for 18 years from the year in which they were generated. These figures do
not include any amounts relating to deductions generated in 2022, because the final amount was still
being calculated at the date of authorising the accompanying annual consolidated financial statements
for issue.

At 31 December 2022, the Group had not recognised any tax credit in the accompanying consolidated statement
of financial position in relation to the deductions pending application at that date.

**Years open to tax inspection-**

Under current legislation, tax settlements cannot be considered to be final until the tax returns filed have been
inspected by the tax authorities or until the statute-of-limitations period has expired (generally four or five years
_in the countries in which the Group's companies are located). In this regard, on 17 April 2019 the Spanish_
consolidated tax group to which the Parent and the majority of the Spanish consolidated subsidiaries belong filed
supplementary corporate income tax returns for 2016 and 2017.

On 8 June 2021 and 17 November 2021, Avot Inversiones, S.L., as the parent of the consolidated tax group in Spain,
filed requests to rectify the income tax returns for 2016 to 2019 and for 2020, respectively.

Consequently, in Spain at 31 December 2022, the Group had 2019 through 2022, inclusive, open to inspection by
the tax authorities for all applicable taxes as well as 2018, 2017 and 2016 for Corporate Income Tax as a result of
the rectification and amended returns filed.

The Parent's Directors believe that the settlements of those taxes have been properly executed and, therefore,
even if differences were to arise in the interpretation of the regulations governing the tax treatment of its
operations, such liabilities as could arise as a result of inspections in certain subsidiary companies in relation to the
remaining years would not have a material effect on the annual consolidated financial statements for the financial

In the financial years ended 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group made purchases from CYLBUR, Compras y
Logística Burgalesa, S.L. (a company related to shareholders of Avot Inversiones, S.L. and affiliated with some of
the Parent's Directors) for total amounts of 3,180 and 3,270 thousand euros, approximately. These transactions
were carried out in the normal course of business and under market conditions. As a consequence of these
transactions, at 31 December 2022 and 2021 the Group had payables with this related company totalling
approximately 831 and 736 thousand euros, respectively.

Moreover, purchases were made and services received from other companies related to the partners of Avot
Inversiones, S.L. in 2022 totalling 551 thousand euros (660 thousand euros in 2021), and lease expenses paid to
other related companies were also recognised amounting to 186 thousand euros (182 thousand euros in 2021).

As a result of the operations carried out with these related companies, at 31 December 2022 the Group recognised
accounts payable to said companies amounting to 98 thousand euros (131 thousand euros at 31 December 2021).

Finally, other transactions with parties and persons indirectly related to the Directors were effected in the ordinary
course of the Group's business. These were not however material and are not relevant for the purposes of giving
a true and fair view of the Group’s consolidated net assets, consolidated financial position and consolidated results.

**(22)** **INFORMATION REGARDING THE PARENT'S DIRECTORS AND THE GROUP'S CORE PERSONNEL**

**Parent Directors’ remuneration and other benefits**

In 2022 and 2021 the members of the Parent's Board of Directors received 3,040 and 3,050 thousand euros,
respectively, in exchange for their administration tasks at the Parent. In addition, since certain members of the
Parent's Board of Directors are also employees thereof and, as such, in 2022 they accrued wages and salaries,
termination benefits and other benefits in this connection totalling 4,165 thousand euros (1,176 thousand euros
_in 2021)._

-----

In 2022 and 2021 the Parent's Directors did not receive any amount whatsoever for the rendering of services.

The sum of these amounts represents the total remuneration accrued by the Parent's Directors in 2022 and 2021,
for any cause or concept.

The Group has not assumed any obligation regarding pensions or life insurance for any current or past members
of the Parent's Board of Directors, although the Group has paid D&O insurance premiums for the Parent's Directors
in 2022 for approximately 106 thousand euros (121 thousand euros in 2021).

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Parent had not granted any loans or advances to its Directors. Moreover, at
these dates the Parent had not provided any guarantees in their favour.

In 2022 and 2021 no agreements between the Group and the shareholders of the Parent or persons acting on their
behalf were concluded, modified or terminated early, corresponding to transactions outside the Group's ordinary
course of business or that would not have taken place under normal conditions. During these years no agreements
were executed between the Group and the Parent's Directors.

**Remuneration and other benefits to the Group's Senior Management**

Remuneration accrued by the Group's Senior Management (those members of the Management Committee that
_are not Directors of the Parent) in 2022 totalled 4,528 thousand euros (3,237 thousand euros in 2021)._

The Group has not entered into any pension commitments, nor has it granted any advances, loans or guarantees
to the members of the Group's senior management. The Group had approved a “Multi-year remuneration plan”
for the Group's senior managers for three-year periods (the latest of which corresponds to the period 2019-2021).
This plan was subject to certain targets being met and the remuneration, if any, that was to be obtained was
scheduled to be paid in the first few months of the year following the end of each three-year period. The Group
had not recognised any provision in relation to this plan at 31 December 2021 because the established conditions
were not being fulfilled and, therefore, no liability had accrued at that date.

At 31 December 2022, the Group had not approved any “Multi-year remuneration plan” for the members of its
senior management.

**Information regarding conflicts of interest involving the Parent’s Directors**

Pursuant to Section 229 “Obligation to avoid conflicts of interest” of the Consolidated Text of the Spanish
Corporate Enterprise Act, approved by Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010, of 2 July, amended on 4 December 2014,
it is hereby reported that there are no situations of direct or indirect conflict of interest involving the members of
the Parent's Board of Directors and individuals related to them and the companies composing the Group.
Transactions between the Group and companies related to certain directors are detailed in Note 21.

**(23)** **RISK POLICY AND MANAGEMENT**

**Financial risk factors-**

Grupo Antolin's activities are exposed to several financial risks: market risk _(fair value risk and price risk), credit_
risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk. Grupo Antolin's global risk management programme focuses on
the uncertainty of financial markets and seeks to minimise potentially adverse effects on the Group's profitability.
Grupo Antolin uses derivatives to hedge certain risks.

Risk management is controlled by the Group's Finance Department in accordance with the policies approved by
the Parent's Board of Directors. This Department identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Group's operating units. The Parent's Board of Directors provides policies for global risk
management, as well as for specific matters such as the exchange rate and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, the use


-----

**_i) Commodity risk-_**

The Group has no material exposure to raw material price fluctuations. In those companies in which this risk
may appear under specific market conditions (plants that use quoted raw materials), the risk is managed
through agreements to pass on the impact of financing commodity prices to customers on the basis of the
prevailing circumstances.

**_ii) Credit risk-_**

Grupo Antolin's customer portfolio is basically distributed among major automobile manufacturing groups,
with a high credit rating (see Note 20 on the percentage distribution of the Group's ordinary revenue based on
the various automobile manufacturers).

Each management unit maintains specific policies to manage this credit risk of its customers, which take into
consideration the financial situation, past experience and other associated factors.

On the other hand, Grupo Antolin historically considers that, given the characteristics of the Group's customers,
receivables maturing in less than 60 days have no expected loss, since they fall within the normal collection
practice in the automotive sector. The Group considers the credit quality of these outstanding balances to be
high, and understands that they have neither suffered impairment and nor are they in arrears.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, impairment of trade and other receivables totalled 5,717 and 4,251 thousand
euros, respectively, and past-due balances receivable from customers that are not provisioned is not
significant. The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2022 and 2021 were the book values.

The credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks
and financial institutions is considered immaterial given the credit quality of the banks with which the Group
operates. The credit risk arising from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits
with banks and financial institutions is considered immaterial, since these transactions are solely executed with
financial institutions with a high credit rating. Grupo Antolin has policies to restrict the amount of risk with any
financial institution.

**_iii) Liquidity risk-_**

Liquidity risk arises as a result of differences in the amounts or the collection and payment dates of the various
assets and liabilities of the Group companies.

Grupo Antolin exercises prudent management of liquidity risk based on the maintenance of sufficient cash and
marketable securities, the availability of financing by means of a sufficient amount of committed credit facilities
and sufficient capacity to settle market positions. In addition, the Group's centralised treasury operations allow
it to manage financial resources more efficiently. Given the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, the
goal of the Group's Finance Department is to maintain flexible financing, through the availability of contracted
credit facilities or factoring lines with or without recourse (through which it transfers its receivables to third
parties).

At 31 December 2022, the Group has a solid financial situation, recording a positive revolving fund amounting
to 356,544 thousand euros. Furthermore, its liquidity has been reinforced thanks to the issue of ordinary longterm bonds totalling 390 million euros, carried out on 29 June 2021 (see Note 17).

The Group's liquidity position in 2022 is based on its strong capacity to generate operating cash flows,
supported by the maintenance of undrawn credit and revolving credit facilities. At 31 December 2022, the
undrawn amount of the credit and revolving credit facilities amounted to 269,622 thousand euros. The Group's
liquidity position guarantees that it will be able to meet cash flow operating needs the debt maturities in 2023


-----

and 2024, amounting to 49,150 and 56,262 thousand euros, respectively (see Note 17), as well as any adverse
financial market situations that might arise in the coming months.

Group Management monitors cash requirements as well as the evolution of its debt ratio. In this regard, Group
Management considers that any liquidity tension that may arise in the short term will be covered with the
financial resources currently available, with the resources generated by the Group in its activities (as indicated
_in the cash budget for 2023) and/or with any future financing that may be arranged._

**_iv) cash flow interest rate risk and fair value risk-_**

Given that the Group does not carry any significant amounts of interest-earning assets, its operating revenues
and cash flows are largely unaffected by the variations in market interest rates.

The Group's interest rate risk stems from its non-current borrowings. The Group's variable rate borrowings
expose it to cash flows interest rate risks. The Group's fixed rate borrowings expose it to fair value interest rate
risks. At the end of the 2022 reporting period, approximately 59% of borrowings were at fixed interest rates.
Antolin does not have any significant interest-earning assets.

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the Group has no derivative instruments contracted to cover its exposure to
variable interest rates. Taking into account the contractual terms of the funding in force at that date, it has
been estimated that a 0.50% change in interest rates would lead to a fluctuation of approximately 2 million
euros in interest expenses.

**_v) Foreign-exchange risk-_**

The international expansion of the Group and its ever-growing volume of business outside the euro zone
expose it, principally, to exchange rate risks in currencies such as the Czech koruna, the Brazilian real, the US
dollar, the Mexican peso, the Pound sterling and the Chinese yuan, which could have an impact on its results.
To reduce its exposure to this risk, the Group avails itself of a variety of mechanisms, such as using local
suppliers and negotiating with customers and suppliers to hedge against major movements in currencies.
Grupo Antolin has not entered into any foreign-currency hedge rate agreements or foreign-currency forwards.

The Group has carried out a sensitivity analysis of the key figures in its budgeted income statement for 2023,
and has concluded that a 5% rise in the euro against currencies such as the Czech koruna, the Brazilian real, the
US dollar, the Mexican peso, the Pound sterling and the Chinese yuan would reduce revenue by approximately
146 million euros _(approximately 3% of the amount budgeted), and budgeted consolidated result for 2023_
would fall by approximately 7.6 million euros.

**Other risk factors-**

The activities of Grupo Antolin are also exposed to other risks that could impact on the economic growth or the
business activity of the markets in which it operates.

The Group's global risk management programme is also focused on the uncertainty of these other risks and
seeks to minimise any adverse effects on the Group's profitability. The Parent’s Board of Directors provides policies
for global risk management in close co-operation with the business units.

**_i)_** **_Effect of the Russia-Ukraine war-_**

The military conflict deriving from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its associated financial sanctions continue
to pose a threat to the recovery scenario of the world's production of light vehicles in 2022. The negative
economic impact of the war in Ukraine is coupled with current risks in relation to supplies with regard to a
lesser, but still present, shortage of semi-conductors, an increase in gas and electricity prices, the generalised
inflation associated with the rest of the production factors and the interest rate hikes in Europe and the United


-----

vehicle production has been adversely affected. The indirect impacts of the Russian invasion have been more
pronounced in Europe, but could spread to other markets if the conflict intensifies. Original equipment
manufacturers (OEM) based in Russia have suspended their production activities and prospects in terms of
resuming their operations in the short term continue to be poor.

As regards Grupo Antolin, the direct impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not considered
significant since the joint sales of our two factories in Russia (St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod) represented
0.17% and 0.5% of the total turnover in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In this regard, and given the uncertainty surrounding the realisation of the Group's assets in Russia, in 2022 the
Group decided to discontinue its operations in that country and initiate a process for the sale of the related
business which was completed in March 2023 (see Note 26). In the consolidated financial statements for 2022
the Group recognised the results of this business as “discontinued operations”, reporting a loss of
approximately 26 million euros under “Profit/(loss) for the year from discontinued operations, net of taxes” in
the accompanying consolidated income statement (see Note 25).

**_ii) Coronavirus (COVID-19)-_**

Economic activity in 2022 continued to be adversely affected by COVID-19, although its influence has not been
as significant as in previous years. The outbreaks and new strains in the various geographical areas have helped
to put further tension on the supply chain and negatively affected, albeit to a lesser extent than in 2020 and
2021, the increase in production volumes initially forecast at global level.

Grupo Antolin has known how to address the various outbreaks of the pandemic with flexibility and with the
experience and knowledged gained in previous years. Application of the Grupo Antolin COVID-19 Protocol is
mandatory for all the companies that form part of Group. This protocol includes, among other issues, measures
that affect organisation within the company, and higiene measures prior to going to the office and on route to
work, measures for entering and leaving the facilities, as well as additional measures in relation to meetings
and restrictions. The main aim of the aforementioned protocol is to safeguard people’s health and safety and
to guarantee the continuity of the business and liquidity.

At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, the Group did not consider
that the effects arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may still continue to arise at global level, will have
a significant impact in 2023 due to the increase in the vaccinated population, the effectiveness of the vaccines
and medical treatments that have been used and the experience gained in previous years. Therefore, the risks
arising from COVID-19 with respect to liquidity, continuity of operations and the measurement of assets and
liabilities have reduced dramatically as compared with the previous year and are not considered to be material.

However, the Parent’s Directors and Group management are constantly monitoring the evolution of the COVID19 situation in order to successfully address any possible impacts, both financial and non-financial, that may
arise.

**_iii)_** **_Climate change-_**

Through its activities, Grupo Antolin wants to comply with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and the
Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda.

Grupo Antolin incorporates issues related to climate change and environmental issues in its risk catalogue,
explicitly in four of the risks included in the corporate catalogue: "Environmental risk", "Risk of non-compliance
with environmental legislation", "Risk of incidents in the environmental management of production" (including
_waste management) and "Risk of climate change"._

“Environmental risk” relates to the absence or inadequate definition of a business contingency plan that covers
both preventive management and recovery of activity in situations caused by serious accidents and/or natural
disasters. It considers extreme weather events that may significantly affect its operations and facilities.


-----

Both the risk of "Non-compliance with environmental legislation" and the risk of "Incidents in the
environmental management of production" _(understood as the occurrence of accidents with environmental_
_impact) refer to the penalties that may be incurred as well as the reputational damage derived from such_
incidents.

In the case of "Climate Change" risk, reference is made to the negative impact of climate change and its
consequences in meeting the Company's strategic objectives.

Grupo Antolin adopts and applies the main conventions and guidelines established in the Global Compact
_(Principles 7, 8 and 9) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP Water Disclosure Project) and has determined_
the progressive reduction of its carbon emissions in order to achieve neutrality by 2040 in its own operations,
with an intermediate 75% _(previously established at 30%)_ reduction in 2028, and wishes to extend this
environmental commitment throughout its entire supply chain in order to achieve total carbon neutrality in
2050.

**(24)** **OTHER INFORMATION**

**Guarantees given to third parties and other contingent liabilities-**

At 31 December 2022 and 2021, various financial institutions had also provided guarantees to public bodies on the
Group's behalf to guarantee compliance with the general and particular terms of certain capital and operating
grants made to the Group (see Note 15), and the repayment of a number of loans granted by public authorities to
fund research and development projects (see Note 19).

The Parent’s Directors do not expect any liabilities not foreseen 31 December 2022 or any significant losses to arise
for the Group as a result of the guarantees given.

**Other current liabilities-**

The balance recorded under this heading at 31 December 2022 corresponds mainly to outstanding remuneration
to personnel, to accruals recorded to match revenues to expenses and to record operations on an accruals basis.

**Fees paid to the auditors-**

The fees for audit and other services provided during 2022 and 2021 by the Group's main auditor, KPMG Auditores,
S.L., or by companies related to them through control, joint ownership interests or management, together with

Trade payables are understood to include amounts payable for the supply of goods or services _(not including_
_suppliers of property, plant and equipment)._

For the purposes of preparing this information, and given the nature of the Group's activities and operations, the
“payment period” is treated as the period between the invoice date (which in practice is generally on or close to
_the date the goods and services are received from the supplier) and the payment date._

In accordance with the above, the information required under this legislation for the financial years ended 31
December 2022 and 2021 for payments made by the Group's Spanish companies is as follows:

2022 2021
Days (a) Days (a)

Average payment period to suppliers 47.71 50.50

Euros) Euros)

Total payments made 484,155 481,234

(a) In accordance with Law 11/2013, of 26 July, establishing measures to support entrepreneurs and
stimulate growth and the creation of jobs, amending Law 3/2004, the maximum legal payment
period is 30 days, which may be extended to up to 60 days with the agreement of both parties.

Also, in connection with the information for 2022 relating to invoices paid by the Spanish Group companies in a
shorter period of time than the period established in the late-payment legislation, the Parent paid a total of 36,950
invoices (representing 72% of the total invoices paid in 2022), involving a total amount of EUR 387,268 thousand
_(80% of the total amount paid during the year)._

**Environmental information-**

Grupo Antolin's environmental activities focus on two general areas:

 Environmental Management System. Based on manuals and procedures common to all the centres defining

the measures to ensure strict compliance with current legislation, the rational use of resources and energy
and minimising the generation of waste.

 Environment-Sensitive Design. Through its research and development centres, the Group designs its products

with a view to minimising the environmental impact of the vehicle over its useful life.

The Group's property, plant and equipment includes certain investments the net book value of which at 31
December 2022 and 2021 totalled approximately 526 and 513 thousand euros, respectively, its purpose being to
reduce the environmental impact of the Group's activity and to protect and enhance the environment. In 2022 and
2021 the Group also incurred certain expenses aimed at protecting and enhancing the environment, totalling
approximately 5,674 and 3,299 thousand euros, respectively.

Grupo Antolin has no other environmental liabilities, provisions or contingencies that could have a significant
impact on its equity, financial position or results (see Note 16).

In particular, given the nature of its activity, the facilities of the Spanish consolidated companies were not included
in the national plan for the allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances and, therefore, they have been
allotted no greenhouse effect gas emission rights. No greenhouse effect gas emission rights have therefore been
recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 nor has any movement
occurred under this heading in 2022. Furthermore, in 2022, the Group has incurred no expenses nor has it recorded
any provision in connection with this item. The Group has not entered into any futures contracts relating to
