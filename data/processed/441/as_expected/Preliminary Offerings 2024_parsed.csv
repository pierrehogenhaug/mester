Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities referred to therein in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities referred to therein. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a member state of the EEA of securities which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the Offering Memorandum may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Regulation, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither the Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers have authorized, nor do they authorize, the making of any offer of securities in circumstances in which an obligation arises for the Issuer or any of the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus for such offer.

Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1990,FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS,1990.4,2023 Segment Reporting Change,1990.4.1,Non-IFRS Financial Information,"This Offering Memorandum contains certain non-IFRS financial measures that are not audited nor required by, nor are presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures we present may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms under the Indenture. We present the following non-IFRS financial measures in this Offering Memorandum (collectively, the “Non-IFRS Financial Measures”): - “EBIT” represents consolidated profit/(loss) for the year/period, before corporate income tax and interest expenses. EBIT as presented herein differs from “EBIT” as presented in the Financial Statements; - “EBITDA” represents EBIT before depreciation and amortization charges. EBITDA as presented herein differs from “EBITDA” as presented in the Financial Statements; - “free cash flow” represents our total net cash flows from operating activities less our capital expenditures; - “Financial debt” represents bank loans, debentures and other marketable securities plus non-recourse factoring and other financial liabilities; - “Management EBITDA” represents EBITDA adjusted for gains or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests, net impairment losses on non-current assets, gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets, profit of companies accounted for using the equity method, other finance costs, finance income, exchange difference and profit/(loss) for the year from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Management EBITDA as presented herein is the same as “EBITDA” as presented in the Financial Statements; - “Management **EBITDA margin” represents Management EBITDA divided by net turnover; - “Net financial debt” represents financial debt less cash and cash equivalents; - “Total operating income from ordinary continuing operations” represents our net turnover plus capital grants and other grants taken to income and other operating revenue; and - “Total operating expenses from ordinary continuing operations” represents the sum of our supplies, staff costs, changes in inventories of finished goods and work in progress, depreciation and amortization charges, variation in provisions for operating allowances, other operating expenses less work performed by the Group on its assets. We present the Non-IFRS Financial Measures for information purposes only, because we believe that they and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. Our management believes that EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin are meaningful for investors because they provide an analysis of our operating results, profitability and ability to service debt and because EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin are used by our chief operating decision makers to track our business evolution, establish operational and strategic targets and make important business decisions. EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin are also measures commonly reported and widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry. To facilitate the analysis of our operations, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin exclude depreciation and amortization charges from EBIT in order to eliminate the impact of general long-term capital investment. Although we are presenting EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin to enhance the understanding of our historical operating performance, EBIT, EBITDA, Management EBITDA and Management EBITDA margin should not be considered as substitutes to earnings as an indicator of our operating performance, or as alternatives to cash flows from ordinary operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. EBITDA and Management EBITDA, as used in this Offering Memorandum, may not be calculated in the same manner as “Consolidated EBITDA”, which is calculated pursuant to the Indenture governing the Notes (see “Description of the Notes”), or for the purposes of any of our other indebtedness. ----- In addition, we present Financial debt and Net financial debt as financial measures of a company’s debt position. We believe they are measures widely used by investors in the valuation of the leverage of companies. Credit rating agencies and lenders use net financial debt to assess net borrowing. Total operating income from ordinary continuing operations is what our management considers to be a measure of performance, since it provides information on how our business is performing, starting with net turnover and adding other income related to our ordinary business operations. Total operating expenses from ordinary continuing operations is considered by our management to be a measure of performance, since it provides information on how our business is performing, starting with costs directly related to net turnover and including other operating expenses from our ordinary business operations. In addition, in this Offering Memorandum, net turnover variance in constant currency is determined by comparing current period figures, calculated using prior period annual average exchange rates, to the prior period net turnover. The resulting percentage variance in constant currency is considered to be a Non-IFRS Financial Measure. Net turnover variance in constant currency calculates net turnover variance without the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. We believe that constant currency variance is an important measure of our operations because it neutralizes foreign exchange impact and illustrates the underlying change from one year to the next. We believe that this presentation provides a useful period-overperiod comparison as changes due solely to changes in exchange rates are eliminated. Net turnover variance in constant currency, as defined and presented by us, may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Net turnover variance in constant currency has limitations, particularly because the currency effects that are eliminated constitute a significant element of our net turnover and expenses and could impact our performance significantly. We do not evaluate our results and performance without considering variances in constant currency and changes prepared in accordance with IFRS. We caution you to follow a similar approach by considering data regarding constant currency period-over-period net turnover variance only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. We present the fluctuation derived from IFRS net turnover next to the fluctuation derived from non IFRS net turnover. Furthermore, the calculation of the like-for-like net turnover growth presented in this Offering Memorandum is based on the growth of the net turnover figure from period to period being compared, and at constant exchange rates, for all subsidiaries that have operated for a period of over twelve months under similar business conditions. A subsidiary is not considered to have operated under similar business conditions, and therefore does not form part of the like-for-like calculation basis, in the event that it has been sold, closed or acquired during the period. We use like-for-like comparable net turnover growth to analyze the evolution of net turnover between periods. Free cash flow is a measure of liquidity that represents the cash that we generate after cash outflows to support [operations and maintain our capital assets. It does not represent residual cash flows entirely available for discretionary purposes.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalasset.asp) This cash can be used for shareholder returns, reducing debt and other investing and/or financing activities. The Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under IFRS. Some of the limitations of each of these Non-IFRS Financial Measures are: - they do not reflect our cash outlays for capital expenditure or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; - they do not reflect income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay our income taxes; - although depreciation and amortization charges and impairment losses on non-current assets are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized and impaired will often have to be replaced in the future, and the Non- IFRS Financial Measures do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; - some of the items that we eliminate in calculating the relevant Non-IFRS Financial Measures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made; - they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of cash flows; and ----- - other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate the Non-IFRS Financial Measures differently from how they are presented in this Offering Memorandum, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. The Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented in this Offering Memorandum are not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC. This information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and should not be relied upon when making an investment decision. You should not consider any of the Non-IFRS Financial Measures presented herein as substitutes to measures of financial performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as a measure of operating results or cash flow as a measure of liquidity. The Non-IFRS Financial Measures are not measures of financial performance under IFRS. Our computation of the Non-IFRS Financial Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Financial Statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. See “Operating and Financial Review and _Prospects—Critical Accounting Policies.”_ Rounding adjustments have been made in calculating some of the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum. As a result, figures shown as totals in some tables and elsewhere may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1990,FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS,1990.4,2023 Segment Reporting Change,1990.4.2,,"From January 1, 2023, we have reduced our number of business segments from three to two, and accordingly split our operations into traditional business segments named (i) “Product Systems” and (ii) “Technology Solutions”, respectively. Our “Product Systems” segment encompasses several products such as headliners, doors and hard trim, instrument panels, central consoles, sun visors, window regulators and trunk parts, and is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard Trim, (iii) Instrument Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) components & JITs. Our Technology Solutions segment is comprised of (i) Lighting, (ii) human-machine interface (“HMI”) and (iii) Electronics Systems products. As a result of this segment reporting change (the “2023 Segment Reporting Change”), the segmental financial information contained in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the prioryear comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the segmental financial information contained in the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, including comparative financial information as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023, gives effect to the new split of our business. We did not restate the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 in order to reflect the 2023 Segment Reporting Change. As a result, the segmental financial information presented in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including the prior-year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021) is therefore not directly comparable to the segmental financial information presented in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the prior-year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022). For this reason, no segmental financial information as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented under “Summary—Summary Financial Information and Other Data,” nor is such financial information discussed under “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1990,FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS,1990.5,Backlog,1990.5.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum, we present backlog, which we define as forecast revenues through new projects awarded to Antolin from our customers. The backlog figures presented herein are based on a number of assumptions, including estimates of the percentage-of-completion of contracts and foreign exchange fluctuations. Factors that could affect the realization of our backlog as future revenue include cancellations, lower volumes than initially anticipated, scope of work adjustments, force majeure, legal impediments and default by our customers. Although historically the extent of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared to our total contract volume and is partially offset by cancellation penalties, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders, resulting in a decrease of the previously reported order backlog. Such cancellations or modifications can hence have a significant effect on the revenue we ultimately recognize from contracts. Backlog gives, at a given date, a picture of the estimated work remaining to complete under contracts in force. There is no guarantee future execution of the backlog would generate the same levels of margin or cash flow as past execution. Backlog should therefore not be used as an indication of future results of operations.

In addition, we have changed our project selection method by switching away from a volume-based approach and instead focusing on internal rate of return payback and capital expenditures as a percentage of net turnover, as well as renegotiating development projects and removing target projects with lower scores. We plan on continuing implementing our new approach towards project selection across all of our operations in order to reduce our capital expenditures, with an estimated 659 projects currently under review. Our new quoting system is expected to further boost the profitability of our order intakes and will be coupled with a high level of already booked sales, with an estimated backlog of €17.0 billion until 2027 (driven by €7 billion of order intakes in 2022 and €5.5 billion of order intakes in 2023), which represents approximately 85% of our component sales target for the same period. Of our estimated €17.0 billion of backlog, we currently estimate that (i) between approximately 85% to 90% will be within our Product Systems segment, with the remainder within our Technology Systems segment, and (ii) between approximately 35% to 40% will be in North America, 15% to 20% will be in Asia and the remainder will be in Europe & ROW. As a result, we expect that the implementation of our business plan will allow us to benefit from a sustainable, profitable and diversified growth in the medium term. We envisage operating with limited leverage through a disciplined financial strategy adapted to our long-term growth needs, which we believe will allow us to achieve a ratio of adjusted net financial debt to Management EBITDA of 1.5x or less, as well as double digit Management EBITDA margin. Our ability to achieve the financial targets and objectives set out above is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and our financial targets and objectives have been developed based upon assumptions with respect to future business decisions and conditions that are subject to change. As a result, our actual results may vary from the financial targets and objectives set out above, and those variations may be material. We do not undertake to publish revised financial targets and objectives to reflect events or circumstances existing or arising after the date of the Offering Memorandum or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events or circumstances.

Since inception, we have been controlled by the Antolín family, the members of which have continuously supported our vision, strategy and growth throughout our evolution. Our Chairman is Canea, S.L., represented by Ernesto Antolín, and our Vice-Chairman is Injat S.L., represented by María Helena Antolín, both members of the Antolín family. HoldCo holds 100.0% of the shares of the Company and is wholly owned by the Antolín family through different holding vehicles, including Avot Inversiones, S.L. Avot Inversiones, S.L. is 100% owned by the Antolín family. The Antolín family has two branches, one under each of the two Antolín brothers who founded Grupo Antolin. Each family branch owns 50% of Avot Inversiones, S.L., holding their shares in Avot Inversiones, S.L. through separate investment vehicles. The board of Avot Inversiones, S.L. is composed of two members of each branch of the Antolín family. In February 2013, the Antolín family signed a shareholders’ agreement regarding its shareholding in Avot Inversiones, S.L. (as amended and restated on June 8, 2021 and on April 27, 2023, the “Shareholders’ Agreement”).

Subject to the satisfaction and discharge in full of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in respect of the 2026 Notes on or about the Issue Date, the ARA will, among others, (i) extend the maturity of €329.5 million of outstanding loans under Facility A6 and €184.7 of commitments under RCF2 to June 30, 2029 (subject to a springing maturity to October 29, 2027, if the 2028 Notes are not refinanced in full on or prior to October 29, 2027 (the “Extended Maturity Date”)), with the remaining €8.6 million of outstanding loans under Facility A1 and €8.9 million of commitments under RCF1 to mature on March 31, 2026, (ii) amend the margin (including the associated margin ratchet) applicable to the tranches of Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility that will mature on the Extended Maturity Date and (iii) amend certain of the undertakings of the Senior Facilities Agreement, including additional conditions on declarations of dividends and additional debt incurrence capacity (such changes to be implemented pursuant to the ARA, the “A&E”). The A&E will become effective pursuant to the ARA upon the satisfaction and discharge in full of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in respect of the 2026 Notes on or about the Issue Date (the “A&E Effective Date”). _Divestment Transactions_ On July 1, 2024, we announced the entry into five agreements as part of our ongoing divestment plans. Pursuant to these agreements, we expect to materially progress in delivering the commitments related to our divestment targets announced in April 2024, as follows (collectively, the “Divestment Transactions”): - _Ototrim: we have signed an agreement with our partner Diniz Holding A.S. for the sale of a 45% stake in Ototrim Panel Sanayi ve Ticaret, A.S. (“Ototrim”) in Turkey for an agreed cash consideration of €45 million. Ototrim is a joint venture established in 1993 by Antolin Irausa S.A.U. and its partner Diniz Holding A.S. (“Diniz”) and currently forms part of our Product Systems segment. Ototrim employs approximately 1,000 employees and operates one manufacturing facility. The transaction is expected to close within 60 days, upon receipt of the relevant regulatory approvals. Following the closing of this transaction, Antolin will maintain a 5% equity stake in Ototrim, and expects to continue working with Diniz going forward. - _Grupo Cosmos: we have signed an agreement with Grupo Cosmos XXI, SL. (“Grupo Cosmos”) for the sale of our trunk trim business for an agreed cash consideration of €31 million. The sale includes carve-outs of manufacturing and assembly businesses of trunk trim operations (which are currently reported under the Headliner division of our Product Systems segment) in Alabama (U.S.) and Silao (México), the factories of Kecskemet (Hungary) and Rastatt (Germany) (both of which are currently reported under the Components and JITs division of our Product Systems segment), and one TCO in Austria. The trunk trim business was considered a non-core business, and its divestment is part of our strategic plan. The operations sold to Grupo Cosmos comprise approximately 400 employees and operates two manufacturing facilities as well as one TCO. The implied enterprise value to Management EBITDA ratios of the operations sold to Grupo Cosmos on an actual basis for the year ended December 31, 2023 and on an estimated basis for the year ended December 31, 2024 are 4.8x and approximately 4.8x, respectively. The transaction is expected to close within 90 days, upon of the issuance of certain regulatory notifications and the completion of certain carve-out activities. We and Grupo Cosmos have also signed a transitional service agreement in order to ensure a smooth transition and the maintenance of an optimal customer service following the completion of the transaction. - _Spanish sale and leaseback: we have closed a sale and leaseback transaction in Spain for €12.9 million in connection with a manufacturing facility located in Burgos. The lease signed pursuant to this transaction has an initial tenor of 12 years. - _Moroccan sale and leaseback:_ we have signed a binding commitment to sale and leaseback transaction in Morocco for €4.2 million in connection with a manufacturing facility located in Tangier. The lease signed pursuant to this transaction has an initial tenor of nine years. The transaction is expected to close within 60 days, subject to customary conditions precedent. - _French asset disposal: we have sold a non-productive building in Besançon (France) for €0.5 million. 12 ----- The aggregate consideration in connection with the Divestment Transactions totals €100 million, of which €18 million have already been received, with the remainder expected to be received during the second half of 2024. This represents more than 65% of our target to achieve €150 million of additional liquidity through asset disposals by 2025. In addition, on July 11, 2024, we closed the sale of a manufacturing plant located in the United States for approximately €11.7 million (equivalent). Pursuant to this sale, we will lease the manufacturing plant from the acquiror, without the right to acquire the asset at the end of the lease term. As part of our ongoing divestment plans, we may enter into further strategic divestment and/or sale and leaseback transactions from time to time. _Current trading_ Our net turnover for the twelve months ended May 31, 2024, amounted to €4,452.3 million, which is 5.9% lower than our net turnover for the twelve months ended May 31, 2023 (€4,733.1 million), and our Management EBITDA for the twelve months ended May 31, 2024 amounted to €357.3 million (representing a Management EBITDA margin of 8.0%), which is 16.6% higher than our Management EBITDA for the twelve months ended May 31, 2023 (€306.5 million, representing a Management EBITDA margin of 6.5%). Our net turnover for the five months ended May 31, 2024 amounted to €1,780.9 million, which is 8.5% lower than our net turnover for the five months ended May 31, 2023 (€1,946.1 million), and that our Management EBITDA for the five months ended May 31, 2024 amounted to €144.0 million (representing a Management EBITDA margin of 8.1%), which is 25.0% higher than our Management EBITDA for the five months ended May 31, 2023 (€115.2 million, representing a Management EBITDA margin of 5.9%). The increase in Management EBITDA is primarily attributable to our strategic plan for the 2023-2026 period, with a focus on rightsizing, footprint optimization, industrial operational excellence and customer centricity. _The unaudited financial results for the periods presented above are based solely on internal information used by management and has not been audited or reviewed by KPMG.

All entities shown below are 100% owned (ignoring any de minimis shareholdings) unless otherwise indicated. The chart does not include all entities in our Group or all of the debt obligations thereof. For a summary of the debt obligations identified in this diagram, see “Description of the Notes,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.” (1) HoldCo holds 100.0% of the shares of the Company and is wholly owned by the Antolín family through different holding vehicles, including Avot Inversiones, S.L. (2) On the Issue Date, the Issuer will issue €250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt and senior to any of its existing or future subordinated debt. The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Company, secured as set forth under “Description of the Notes—Security” and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is not subordinated to the Notes, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of the Company that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes. (3) On the 2028 Notes Issue Date, the Issuer issued the 2028 Notes, which comprise €390.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes due 2028, which were issued by the Company pursuant to the 2028 Notes Indenture. An aggregate principal amount of €9.7 million of the 2028 Notes was repurchased by the Company pursuant to an open market transaction in July 2022 and, as a result, an aggregate principal amount of €380.3 million of the 2028 Notes remain outstanding as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. See “Description of Other Indebtedness— _2028 Notes.”_ (4) As of March 31, 2024, after giving effect to the Transactions, the Senior Facilities Agreement provided for Facility A in an aggregate principal amount of €338.1 million and the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of €193.6 million (€4.5 million of which has been utilized as ancillary facilities), €130.0 million of which was drawn as of March 31, 2024. For further details, see “Capitalization” and “Description _of Other Indebtedness—Senior Facilities Agreement”. The A&E will become effective pursuant to the ARA on the A&E Effective Date. See_ “Summary—Recent Developments— Amendment and Extension of the Senior Facilities.” 14 ----- (5) We have additional bank and other debt, which has been incurred and guaranteed by the Company and several of our subsidiaries, including the Guarantors. As of March 31, 2024, as adjusted for the Transactions, we would have had €1,494.8 million of financial debt, and subsidiaries of the Company that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €21.8 million of debt outstanding on a consolidated basis. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness”. (6) The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility and (ii) within 120 days from the Issue Date (subject to the satisfaction of applicable local law formalities and the Agreed Security Principles), by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which will also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, provided that such Guarantors’ Guarantees will be subject to the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and “Enforceability of _Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.” The Guarantee to be provided by Grupo Antolin South Africa (PTY) Ltd within 120 days from the Issue_ Date requires the approval of the FinSurv. See “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes—Not all of the Guarantees will initially guarantee the _Notes.” The Guarantee of each Guarantor will be a general senior obligation of that Guarantor, and will (i) rank pari passu in right of payment with_ all existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is not subordinated to that Guarantor’s Guarantee, including the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes and any guarantees thereof, (iii) be effectively subordinated to all of such Guarantor’s existing and future indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes to the extent of the value of the property or assets securing such indebtedness and (iv) be structurally subordinated to any existing and future debt of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

See “—The Offering—Guarantors”. We believe the Guarantors represent all entities within the Group that are suitable to provide meaningful credit support in light of local law guarantee limitations and/or requirements applicable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate that might make it difficult or otherwise impracticable to provide a meaningful guarantee and increase in substance the coverage of the Group’s total Management EBITDA and net turnover. (7) Within 120 days from the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Collateral. Notwithstanding the fact that the Notes will be secured by a pledge numerically successive to the pledges securing the existing senior secured debt, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, recoveries received upon enforcement of the Collateral will be applied _pro rata in repayment of the 2028 Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility.

The Collateral will be subject to certain contractual and legal limitations, and may be released under certain circumstances. The laws of Spain limit the amount of obligations that may be guaranteed, or in respect of which security interests may be provided as well as the enforceability of the Guarantees and the security securing the Notes and the Guarantees.

These fluctuations are caused by such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences (including the effects of the increase of the use of shared cars and mobility services), patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle, and such fluctuations give rise to changes in demand for our products and may have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, OEM customers generally do not commit to purchasing minimum quantities from their suppliers. As our business has certain fixed costs that must be met regardless of demand for our products, cyclical downturns can further affect our results of operations. The highly cyclical and fluctuating nature of the automotive industry presents a risk that is outside and beyond our control and that cannot be accurately predicted. Moreover, a number of factors that we cannot predict can and have impacted cyclicality in the past. Decreases in demand for automobiles generally, or in the demand for automobiles incorporating our products in particular, could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.2,"We are susceptible to economic trends, and deterioration of economic conditions could adversely impact our business and exacerbate the difficulties experienced by our customers and suppliers in obtaining financing.","A significant economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business. Continued concerns about the systemic impact of a potential long-term and wide-spread recession, energy costs, strong currency fluctuations, the availability and cost of credit, diminished business and consumer confidence and increased persistent unemployment in Europe have contributed to increased market volatility and diminished expectations for western and emerging economies, including in the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, any increased financial instability may lead to longer-term disruptions in the credit markets, which could impact our customers’ ability to obtain financing for their businesses at reasonable prices, as well as impact their customers when seeking financing for automobile purchases. Our OEM customers typically require significant financing for their respective businesses. In addition, our OEM customers typically have related finance companies that provide financing to their dealers and customers. These finance companies have historically been active participants in the securitization markets, which has suffered and may suffer additional disruptions should economic conditions deteriorate in the future. Our suppliers, as well as the other suppliers to our customers, may face similar difficulties in obtaining financing for their businesses. If capital is not available to our customers and suppliers, or if its cost is prohibitively high, their businesses would be negatively impacted, which could result in their restructuring or even reorganization/liquidation under applicable bankruptcy laws. Any such negative impact, in turn, could materially and negatively affect us either through the loss of revenues to any of our customers so affected, or due to our inability to meet our commitments without excess expense resulting from disruptions in supply caused by the suppliers so affected. Financial difficulties experienced by any major customer could have a material adverse impact on us if such customer were unable to pay for the products we provide, materially reduced its capital expenditure on, and resulting demand for, new product lines, or we otherwise experienced a loss of, or material reduction in, business from such customer. 29 ----- As a result of such difficulties, we could experience lost revenues, significant write-offs of accounts receivable, significant impairment charges or additional restructurings beyond the steps we have taken to date. Furthermore, increased financial instability in credit and other financial markets and deterioration of Spanish and/or global economic conditions could, among others: - make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or to refinance our debt in the future, - cause our lenders to depart from prior credit industry practice and make more difficult or expensive the granting of any technical or other waivers under our debt facilities, to the extent we may seek them in the future, and - negatively impact global demand for our products, which could result in a reduction of our sales, operating income and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.3,"Continuing uncertainties and challenging geopolitical conditions in Spain, the European economy and the euro could intensify the risks faced by the automotive industry and our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and profitability.","Our results of operations are dependent on the economic and geopolitical conditions of markets in which we operate, including Europe, North America, India and South America, some of which have experienced economic declines recently, including in particular, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and during various periods in the past decade. Furthermore, our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending, which may be affected by negative economic and political conditions. Economic contraction, heightened inflation, economic and political uncertainty and the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for the automotive interior components that we offer. Rising interest rates negatively impact demand across the automotive industry by making it more expensive to obtain vehicle financing, which may result in decreased demand for our vehicles and in turn decreased demand for our services and products. In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as an unstable job market or perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth. Economic downturns and economic and political volatility in the various markets in which we operate may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, Europe & ROW accounted for 52.1% and 52.8% of our combined Asia, Europe & ROW and North America segments net turnover and Management segment EBITDA, respectively. As a result, adverse economic effects within Europe could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Continuing or renewed instability in the European markets, the fluctuation of the euro and the composition of Europe have recently contributed to weak European economic performance. Future developments may continue to be dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the European Central Bank and the European Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the continued stability of the Eurozone. Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual member states of the Eurozone. These concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the Eurozone and the reintroduction of national currencies in the affected countries. The reintroduction of national currencies in one or more countries that use the euro could lead to the disruption of financial markets and could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Furthermore, any such redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our services and, accordingly, on our net turnover and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies within the countries in which we operate may impact our billing and other financial systems. In light of the significant exposure that we have to the euro through our euro-denominated cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there are several potential sources of economic uncertainty which could adversely affect the economy in particular. First, the attacks in Israel by Hamas on October 7, 2023 and the conflict that followed in the Gaza Strip has created an unstable geopolitical environment in the Middle East. Further, the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation on February 24, 2022, has resulted in certain sanctions being imposed by the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and other jurisdictions (including the freezing of the assets related to the Russian government and individuals as well as the exclusion of certain Russian financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging system), all of which are expected to negatively impact the global economy and financial markets. We cannot predict the impact of the rising conflict between Israel and Hamas, 30 ----- which controls the Gaza Strip, or of Russian actions in Ukraine and any heightened military conflict or geopolitical instability that may follow, including heightened operating risks and production disruptions in the Middle East, Russia and Europe, additional sanctions or counter-sanctions, heightened inflation, market volatility, cyber disruptions or attacks, higher energy costs, higher manufacturing costs, disruptions in raw materials supplies, increased raw material costs and higher supply chain costs. Therefore, the imposition of sanctions on the Russian Federation, higher energy costs and commodity prices, cyber disruptions or attacks, heightened general operating risks and disruption of logistic chains in Europe, may result in economic instability, market volatility and heightened inflation, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Further, heightened inflation and increased commodity prices may have a negative impact on purchasing power and consumer spending, which could have an adverse effect on our business and cash flows. We discontinued our Russian operations in 2022 by initiating a sale process of our entire business in this market, which was successfully completed in March 2023. As a result, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have no assets or operations in Russia, which was recognized as “discontinued operations” in our financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023. Moreover, the rising tensions between Russia on one hand and the United States, United Kingdom and Europe on the other, particularly in relation to Russia’s actions in Ukraine and other geopolitical uncertainties (including escalating tensions in certain regions of the world) as well as volatility in commodity prices or a negative market reaction to central bank policies, may affect the growth of the Spanish economy and other countries in which we operate. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.4,We are dependent on large customers for current and future net turnover. The loss of any of these customers or changes in the market share by these customers could have a material adverse impact on us.,"Although we supply our products to several of the leading automobile manufacturers, as is common in our industry, we depend on certain large value customers for a significant proportion of our net turnover. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors—Jaguar Land Rover, represented 22.0%, 15.0%, 13.0%, 7.0% and 7.0% of our net turnover, respectively. The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of our large volume customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing cash flows and by limiting our ability to spread our fixed costs over a larger net turnover base. We may make fewer sales to these customers for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: - loss of awarded business; - reduced or delayed customer requirements; - OEMs’ insourcing business they have traditionally outsourced to us; - strikes or other work stoppages affecting production by our customers; - bankruptcy or insolvency of a customer; or - reduced demand for our customers’ products. See also “—We are susceptible to economic trends, and deterioration of economic conditions could adversely impact _our business and exacerbate the difficulties experienced by our customers and suppliers in obtaining financing”._ Furthermore, our customers may consolidate or merge from time to time. For example, FCA and PSA merged into the new Stellantis, and became world’s third largest automaker in terms of revenues when considering cars produced since its inception in January, 2021. Consolidation among our customers could result in an increasingly concentrated client base of large customers which could, among others, increase the bargaining power of our current and future customers and impact the terms of the services that we provide. Mergers of our customers with entities that are not our customers could also materially impact our financial position and results of operations. Any significant changes in the ownership or operation of our customers, as a result of consolidation, merger or otherwise, could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. 31 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Typically the terms and conditions of the agreements with our customers do not include a commitment regarding minimum volumes of purchases from us. In addition, such contracts typically provide that customers have the contractual right to unilaterally terminate our contracts with them with no notice or limited notice. If such contracts are terminated by our customers, our ability to obtain compensation from our customers for such termination is generally limited to the direct out-of-pocket costs that we incurred for materials and work-in-progress and in certain instances undepreciated capital expenditures and tooling. Further, there is no guarantee that our customers will renew their purchase orders with us. We cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be materially adversely impacted in the future if we are unable to realize net turnover from our awarded business, if our customers cancel awarded business or if our customers fail to renew their contracts with us.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to our Business,13.1.6,"Disruptions in the automotive supply chain could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.","The automotive supply chain is subject to disruptions because we, along with our customers and suppliers, attempt to maintain low inventory levels. In addition, our plants are typically located in close proximity to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to contain its spread and address its impact have had significant direct and indirect effects on businesses and commerce generally, including disruptions to supply chains, workforce, international travel, transactional activity, facility operations and production. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, both production volumes and sales were hit heavily due to severe measures imposed by governments that forced us to temporarily close some of our production facilities and halt production in others. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on the global automotive supply chain due to plant closures, reductions in demand for automobiles and other factors. A resurgence or prolonged continuance of a public health crisis could have a material adverse effect, including materially increased volatility in financial markets and significant worsening of the global, European or U.S. macroeconomic outlooks. There are no comparable recent events in scale and duration that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot currently estimate with any certainty, nor can we provide any assurance as to whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. Our supply chains are affected by both a global shortage of chips and semiconductors, and the increasing volatility of certain raw materials. These changes have affected the way market participants operate in the auto industry, which historically operated following a JIT model to properly optimize working capital management and reduce costs. For example, several automakers and OEMs are investing in building up their inventories to anticipate potential supply disruptions in order to meet their clients’ demand, while others are actively investing in new facilities to produce products that they used to source from outside suppliers, in order to have full control of their supply chain. Due to limited semiconductor production in China and Taiwan as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the secured industry experienced semiconductor shortages which decreased the production volume and, consequently, adversely impacted our business. The current shortage of semiconductors may be further exacerbated by the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, which has caused global supply chain disruptions and shortages in raw materials used in semiconductor manufacturing such as neon and palladium. Any disruption due to semiconductor shortages has impacted, and may continue to impact, the demand for our technologies and our production costs. Disruptions could be caused by a multitude of potential problems, such as closures of one of our or our suppliers’ plants or critical manufacturing lines due to strikes, mechanical breakdowns, electrical outages, fires, explosions or political upheaval, as well as logistical complications due to weather, earthquakes, other natural or nuclear disasters, pandemics, mechanical failures, delayed customs processing and more. The global value chain has in the past experienced disruptions as the result of a general lack of production capacity for certain raw materials or components. Additionally, if we are the cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from us. Any disruptions affecting us or caused by us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 32 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Our liquidity could also be adversely impacted if our suppliers were to suspend normal trade credit terms and require payment in advance or payment on delivery. If our available cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our ongoing cash needs, we would be required to look to our cash balances and availability for borrowings under our credit facilities to satisfy those needs, as well as potential sources of additional capital, which may not be available on satisfactory terms and in adequate amounts, if at all. There can be no assurance that we, our customers and our suppliers will continue to have such ability. This may increase the risk that we cannot produce our products or will have to pay higher prices for our inputs. These higher prices may not be recovered in our selling prices. Our suppliers often seek to obtain credit insurance based on the strength of the financial condition of our subsidiary with the payment obligation, which may be less robust than our consolidated financial condition. If we were to experience liquidity issues, our suppliers may not be able to obtain credit insurance and in turn would likely not be able to offer us payment terms that we have historically received.

To the extent that our agreements with suppliers do not protect us from increases in the cost of materials or that we cannot pass through increases in the costs of our materials to our customers, we are exposed to risks related to unfavorable fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not use derivatives to hedge our purchases of materials or energy. Recently, commodity prices increased, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to pass on all such price increases to our customers.

In connection therewith, we intend to continue optimizing our footprint and rightsizing our business operations through productivity improvement resulting from advanced manufacturing processes. In addition, we intend to also continue enhancing direct labor efficiency through automation, as well as indirect labor efficiency through structural streamlining. Through the strategic plan, we aim to reduce our current footprint by up to 15% and we expect to achieve additional liquidity of an estimated €150 million through selective asset sales, with identified potential for additional gains by completing further divestments in our current pipeline. We also intend to further optimize our footprint by continuing to increase our operations in low-cost countries in Eastern Europe and North America in order to streamline our operations and reduce our cost base. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our strategic plan in a timely fashion or at all. The operational improvements targeted as part of our strategic plan involve significant assumptions, including assumptions related to the realization of certain cost reductions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the implementation of the initiatives and business and operating performance. In developing our financial targets relating to the strategic plan, we have made certain assumptions about the financial impact that the aforementioned operational improvement measures will have on our future financial results.

As of December 31, 2023, our backlog between 2024 and 2027 was estimated to be approximately €17.0 billion, which represents approximately 85% of our component sales target for the same period. Of our estimated €17.0 billion of backlog, we currently estimate that (i) between approximately 85% to 90% will be within our Product Systems segment, with the remainder within our Technology Systems segment, and (ii) between approximately 35% to 40% will be in North America, 15% to 20% will be in Asia and the remainder will be in Europe & ROW. Backlog figures are based on a number of assumptions, including estimates of the percentage-of-completion of contracts and foreign exchange fluctuations. Factors that could affect the realization of our backlog as future revenue include cancellations, lower volumes than initially anticipated, scope of work adjustments, force majeure, legal impediments and default by our customers. Although historically the extent of modifications and terminations of our orders has not been material compared to our total contract volume and is partially offset by cancellation penalties, customers can, and sometimes do, terminate or modify their orders, resulting in a decrease of the previously reported order backlog. Such cancellations or modifications can hence have a significant effect on the revenue we ultimately recognize from contracts. Backlog gives, at a 35 ----- given date, a picture of the estimated work remaining to complete under contracts in force. There is no guarantee future execution of the backlog would generate the same levels of margin or cash flow as past execution. Backlog should therefore not be used as an indication of future results of operations, and the non-realization of our backlog could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial position and operational results.

If any of our strategic partners were to encounter financial difficulties, change their business strategies or no longer be willing to participate in these strategic partnerships, joint ventures and alliances, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Moreover, in some of these businesses, we may not have the power to control the payment of dividends or other distributions, so even if the business is performing well, we may not be able to receive payment of our share of any profits.

The remaining deferred tax assets include net operating loss carry forwards that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss carry forwards may be limited and delayed. We periodically determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among others, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the factors described above or other factors, we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several foreign jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could adversely affect our financial results. Finally, the Company and some of its Spanish subsidiaries and holding companies form a tax group subject to the special tax consolidation regime for corporate income tax purposes. If, for whatever reason, the consolidated tax regime were forfeited or the tax group extinguished, the right to offset the tax loss carry forwards and use the tax credits of the tax group would be assigned to the companies that generated them.

IFRS requires that goodwill be periodically evaluated for impairment based on the fair value of the reporting unit.

In particular, our international operations are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010, and economic sanction programs, including those administered by the UN, EU and Office of Foreign Asset Control in the United States. These laws prohibit improper business conduct and restrict us from dealing with certain sanctioned countries. As a result of our international operations we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations applicable in those countries where we operate. Some of the countries in which we operate lack as developed a legal system as other locations and are perceived to have high levels of corruption. Our continued geographical diversification, including in emerging economies, development of joint venture relationships worldwide and our employment of local agents in the countries in which we operate increases the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or similar laws. Violations of anti-corruption laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts (and termination of existing contracts) and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, any major violations could have a significant impact on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business. We have a Compliance Management System, which includes policies and procedures designed to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. This system encompasses training our employees in multiple related subjects such as the Code of Ethics, anti-harassment, anti-bribery, antitrust, conflict of interest, data protection, information security, international trade, and respectful communications. Our Code of Conduct, updated in 2023 and translated into all the languages in which our Group operates, aims to educate our employees on these policies and principles. In order to continuously reinforce our Corporate Governance Model, we established a Compliance Direction in 2017, which serves to assist in promoting and developing a global compliance culture within the core of our organization and to define a regulatory compliance system as a guarantee for the effective support of integrity within the organization. While we have a strong compliance culture and believe we have adequate control systems in place, we have globally implemented SAP-GRC (Risk and Controls Management Module) to ensure that compliance risks are identified, analyzed, and assessed. Since 2020, we have also implemented a comprehensive compliance management system, which integrates various key aspects, including criminal compliance and anti-bribery, and has been certified with the requirements of reference standards UNE 19601, ISO/UNE 37001, and the recently acquired global compliance standard ISO 37301. We seek to continuously improve our system of internal controls to remedy any weaknesses identified through appropriate corrective actions, depending on the circumstances. These actions may include additional training, enhancement of employees' quality of life, and other relevant measures. Ensuring the privacy and protection of data is also a core component of our Compliance Management System. We are committed to safeguarding the personal and sensitive information of our employees, clients, and stakeholders. To this end, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer in 2023, who is responsible for overseeing our data protection strategy and its implementation to ensure compliance with privacy regulations and maintenance BCRs. Our data protection policies are designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection laws in the jurisdictions where we operate. We implement robust data security measures, including encryption, access controls, and regular audits, to protect against data breaches and unauthorized access. Our commitment to compliance, privacy, and data protection is reflected in our comprehensive management systems and continuous improvement efforts.

Such non-euro currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the 38 ----- operations. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the consolidated income statement as and when they occur. We are subject to risk if the foreign currency in which our costs are paid appreciates against the currency in which we generate revenues because the appreciation effectively increases our cost in that country. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of some of our operating entities are reported in foreign currencies and then translated into euro at the applicable foreign exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, appreciation of the euro against these foreign currencies generally will have a negative impact on our reported sales and profits while depreciation of the euro against these foreign currencies will generally have a positive effect on reported revenues and profits. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the relative values of the non-euro currencies in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition and any sustained change in such relative currency values could adversely impact our competitiveness in certain geographic regions. For example, the foreign exchange impact represented €67.4 million (or €138.8 million to give effect to the dollarization of our Mexican business) of decreased net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023 (on a “like for like” basis compared to the year ended December 31, 2022) and €11.3 million (or €22.3 million to give effect to the dollarization of our Mexican business) of decreased net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023 (on a “like for like” basis). Economic instability in the countries in which we operate where the euro is not the local currency and the related decline in the value of the relevant local currency in these countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we, at Grupo Antolin, have not entered into any foreign-currency hedge rate agreements or forward contracts, we seek a variety of mechanisms to hedge against major movements in currencies, such as using local suppliers and negotiating with customers and suppliers. We may also use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from foreign currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities may also negatively impact operating results. For the year ended December 31, 2023, an additional 5% rise in the euro against currencies such as the Czech crown, the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso, the UK pound and the Chinese renminbi would have reduced our net turnover by approximately €128 million.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

We are generally required under our customer contracts to indemnify our customers for product liability claims in respect of our products. Accordingly, we may be materially and adversely impacted by product liability claims. If any of our products are, or are alleged to be, defective, we may be required to participate in a recall involving those products. In addition, our customers demand that we bear the cost of the repair and replacement of defective products which are either covered under their warranty or are the subject of a recall by them. Warranty provisions are established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing or probable claims on product defect issues. Recall costs are costs incurred when government regulators or our customers decide to recall a product due to a known or suspected performance issue and we are required to participate either voluntarily or involuntarily. Currently, under most customer agreements, we only account for existing or probable warranty claims. We have no warranty and recall data which allows us to establish accurate estimates of, or provisions for, future warranty or recall costs relating to new products, assembly programs or technologies being brought into production. In addition, our insurance covering product recalls is limited in amount and coverage and in some jurisdictions non-existent. The obligation to repair or replace such products could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. A decrease in actual and perceived quality of our products could damage our image and reputation and also the image and reputation of one or more of our brands.

If we fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or become subject to litigation. Environmental and pollution control laws, regulations and permits, and the enforcement thereof, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may necessitate substantial capital expenditures or operating costs. We are also subject to environmental laws requiring investigation and clean-up of environmental contamination. Estimating environmental clean-up liabilities is complex and heavily dependent on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to the contaminated sites, the complexity of the contamination, the uncertainty of which 42 ----- remedy to apply and the outcome of discussions with regulatory authorities relating to the contamination. In addition, these environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent and expensive over time. Therefore, in the future, we may not be in complete compliance with all such laws and regulations and we may incur material costs or liabilities as a result of such laws and regulations. In addition to potentially significant investigation and cleanup costs, contamination can give rise to third party claims for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury or property damage. For example, Trimtec Ltda. (“Trimtec”), our Brazilian subsidiary, is subject to, together with 49 other companies, an environmental claim initiated in 2009 in connection with alleged environmental damages caused by Companhia Brasileira de Bauxita (“CBB”). CBB was hired to provide services of incineration and industrial waste disposal for Trimtec and other companies in 2001. CBB did not perform such services and failed to dispose of the waste adequately, which allegedly led to causing the litigious environmental damage. A first independent expert in the assessment and valuation of environmental damages was appointed in connection with the proceedings and has issued an expert’s report which was only submitted to the public prosecutor. Upon examination of the independent expert’s report, the public prosecutor proposed terms of adjustment of conduct, to which Trimtec adhered. As a result, and following the identification of the environmental damages, a further independent expert was appointed in order to assess the scope of the remedial works to be undertaken in order to remedy the environmental damages caused by CBB. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, this independent expert has accessed the area impacted by the environmental in order to appraise the scope thereof and, as a result, these proceedings remain ongoing.

The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement provide that decisions regarding enforcement are made by the holders of the Notes, holders of the 2028 Notes and lenders holding, collectively, a majority in aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. As a result, holders of the Notes may not solely control decisions in respect to the Collateral, including timing of enforcement and such other secured parties may have interests that are not the same as those of holders of the Notes. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Company, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the Security Agent, acting on behalf of the Trustee or investors as holders of the Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. In the event of enforcement of the pledge over the Collateral, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for a release of all obligations of the Company and the Guarantors. As a result, if the proceeds of any sale of Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes and the Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Collateral) would have no remaining claim against the Company or any Guarantor. Creditors of the Company or its subsidiaries not secured by a lien on the Collateral will not be obligated to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement.

Therefore, any guarantee or security interest granted by any company incorporated under the laws of Spain shall not extend to any payment obligation incurred by the Issuer for the purpose of acquiring the shares of such Spanish guarantor or the shares of its parent company or the shares of any member of their corporate group, as applicable, to the extent that such security interest would constitute unlawful financial assistance. Furthermore, any guarantee or security granted by any Spanish company shall not apply to the extent the proceeds are used to repay existing indebtedness of the Issuer if such existing indebtedness was used for the purposes described above. The interpretations of the laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of the Guarantors organized in Spain to guarantee the Notes or the ability of HoldCo to grant security on the Collateral. Although the law does not establish any limit, recent Spanish case law indicates, and certain scholars understand that, risks associated with a guarantee or the value of a security interest provided by a Spanish company to secure the indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s or grantor’s own perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such guarantor or grantor and all this must be evidenced to the judge. Furthermore, the interpretations of the laws of Spain of certain scholars about the specialty principle (principio de _especialidad), conclude that a security interest can only secure one primary obligation, together with its ancillary obligations._ Therefore, when there are multiple primary obligations with respect to different creditors, such as the secured creditors under Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility and the holders of the Notes, there must be at least one security interest for each primary obligation to be secured. Additionally, although multiple mortgages over the same asset securing different obligations are recognized, Spanish law does not expressly recognize the existence of two or more pledges over the same asset. However, the existence of two or more pledges over the same shares has become a market practice in Spain and is accepted by the majority of legal scholars although no case law has supported the enforceability of such pledges and it cannot be disregarded that a court could take a different view and consider such pledges inefficient and not admissible in Spain.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes,13.2.7,Under Spanish law the enforcement of the Guarantees and the Collateral granted by any Spanish obligor may be restricted.,"_Insolvency law_ The Royal Legislative Decree 1/2020 approving the consolidated text of the Insolvency Law (Real Decreto Legislativo _1/2020, de 5 de mayo, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley Concursal), as amended (“Spanish Insolvency Law”)_ imposes a moratorium on the enforcement of secured creditors’ rights (in rem security) in the event of insolvency of the debtor (though does not apply to financial collateral considered as such under Royal Decree 5/2005, dated March 11, as amended from time to time (the ""RDL 5/2005"")). Enforcements of in rem securities can be suspended if the debtor (owner of the security) initiates the so called preinsolvency communication before the applicable Court, informing that it has initiated negotiation with its creditors to reach a restructuring plan in accordance with Title II (Título II) of the Second Book (Libro Segundo) of the Spanish Insolvency Law (the “Opening of Negotiations communication”). Such enforcements can be initiated but are suspended for a three month period (potentially extendable three additional months) as from the Opening of Negotiations Communication if the _in rem security befalls assets or rights required for the continuity of the professional or business activities. On the contrary, enforcement of public law claims or labor claims are not affected by the Opening of Negotiations Communication. Enforcement is also stayed in case a restructuring plan is submitted for homologation and it is admitted by the court, until the time the court decides to homologate it or not. If the restructuring plan affects the credit rights secured by the in-rem collateral, the homologation of the plan allows to impose such measures to the secured credit rights of the creditor even in case such creditor has not adhered to the restructuring plan (i.e., if it is a dissenting creditor), provided that the requirements for the homologation of a restructuring plan are fulfilled (i.e., approval by the relevant majorities of the classes of claims, among others) without prejudice of the creditor’s right to challenge the homologation. According to article 651.1 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, creditors holding security rights that have voted against the plan and belong to a class in which the favorable vote was lower than the dissenting vote, will have the right to request the realization of the encumbered assets or rights within one month from the publication of the approval order in the public insolvency registry. However, the proceeding for the enforcement of the security shall be conducted before the competent court and shall be subject to the time limits and requirements of the corresponding enforcement proceeding. Once the debtor is declared insolvent, the enforcement of security interests over assets owned by the debtor and used for its professional or business activities is stayed until the first of the following circumstances occurs: (a) an arrangement of a 47 ----- composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition agreement does not affect such right; or (b) one year has elapsed since the declaration of insolvency without liquidation proceedings being initiated. Enforcement will be stayed even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the assets are not necessary for the survival of the debtor’s professional or business activities. When it comes to determining which assets of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets. Nevertheless, the Spanish Insolvency Law establishes that the shares or quotas of companies exclusively destined to hold assets and the liabilities necessary for their financing will not be considered necessary for the continuation of the debtor’s business, provided that the enforcement of the security over the shares or quotas does not constitute a cause of termination or modification of those contractual relationships of the company that allow the debtor to continue exploiting such assets. The opening of the liquidation phase will result in the loss of the right to initiate the enforcement or compulsory realisation of the security over assets and rights of the estate by those creditors who had not exercised these actions before the opening of the insolvency proceedings or had not initiated them one year after such date. Secured creditors shall recover the right of enforcement or compulsory realisation when one year has elapsed since the opening of the liquidation without the affected asset or right having been disposed of. _Limitation on validity and enforcement of Guarantees and the Collateral_ Enforcement of Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the provisions of Law of Civil Procedure (Ley de _Enjuiciamiento Civil) (the “LEC 2000”) and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable) and this may entail delays in the_ enforcement. Under Spanish law, claims may become time-barred (five years being the general term established for obligations in _personam under Article 1,964 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil)) or may be or become subject to the defense of set-off_ or counterclaim. The terms “enforceable”, “enforceability”, “valid”, “legal”, “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all of the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. Enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: ##### • the nature of the remedies available in the courts; and • the availability of defenses such as (without limitation) set-off (unless validly waived) or counter-claim, circumvention of law (fraude de ley), abuse of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, unforeseen circumstances, undue influence, duress, and abatement. In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee, pledge or mortgage must guarantee or secure another obligation to which it is ancillary, which must be clearly identified in the relevant guarantee or security agreement. Therefore, the guarantee or security interest follows the underlying obligation in such a way that nullity of the underlying obligation entails nullity of the guarantee or security and termination of the underlying obligation entails termination of the guarantee or security. In the event that the security providers are able to prove that there are no existing and valid guaranteed obligations, Spanish courts may consider that the security providers’ obligations under the relevant guarantees or securities are not enforceable. Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected (or registered or other foreign equivalent) and its priority retained through certain actions undertaken by the secured party. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes from time to time owned by us or the Guarantors may not be perfected (or registered or other foreign equivalent), which may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection (or registration or other foreign equivalent), of the security interest for the benefit of the Trustee and holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee will be obligated to create or perfect any of the security interests in the Collateral. Spanish law does not contemplate the concept of a “security agent”. Although this by itself does not prohibit this agent to be set in place, the fact that there is a lack of regulation on the matter provides uncertainty as to how a Spanish court would recognize the acting of the Security Agent in an enforcement situation. Since holders of the Notes will not have any independent power to enforce the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the Security Agent following the instructions of the Trustee, 48 ----- there is some uncertainty as to whether a Spanish court would recognize the authority of the Security Agent or whether lack of recognition would entail delays in the enforcement or even the consequence of the Collateral not being able to be enforced on the same terms as provided for in the Security Documents by the Security Agent. _Capitalization_ In addition, under Spanish law there are some provisions on capitalization which have to be taken into account when security interests are enforced. For instance, when the enforcement of the security interests cause the amount of the relevant Spanish subsidiary net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital, the Spanish subsidiary will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to re-establish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency.

See “Capitalization”. We anticipate that our substantial indebtedness will continue for the foreseeable future. Our substantial indebtedness may have important negative consequences for you, including: - making it more difficult for us and our subsidiaries to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes and other liabilities; - requiring that a substantial portion of the cash flow from operations of our operating subsidiaries be dedicated to debt service obligations, reducing the availability of cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes; - increasing our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry; - exposing us to interest rate increases; - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow; - limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry; - restricting us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities; and - limiting, among others, our and our subsidiaries’ ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs of such additional financings.

As a result, although the Company’s subsidiaries may have sufficient resources, on a consolidated basis, to allow the Company to make the necessary payments on the Notes, the Company’s subsidiaries may not be able to make the necessary transfers to permit the Company to satisfy its obligations under the Notes or otherwise. In particular, the Company’s subsidiaries may be restricted from providing funds to it under some circumstances. These circumstances include: - restrictions under the corporate law of the jurisdictions in which the Company’s subsidiaries are based. The relevant laws could require, among others, that its subsidiaries retain a certain percentage of annual net income in a legal reserve, that its subsidiaries maintain the share capital of a limited liability company and that, after payment of any divided, the relevant subsidiary’s shareholders’ equity exceed its share capital. For example, Spanish law limits certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to provide funds to the Company due to restrictions that require, among others, each of its Spanish subsidiaries to retain at least 10% of their annual profit (beneficio) in a legal reserve until the reserve reaches at least 20% of such company’s share capital and that, after payment of any dividend, shareholders’ equity must be equal to or exceed the company’s share capital. In addition, in order for Spanish companies to distribute dividends available reserves must be equal to, or greater than, the R&D expenses appearing in the balance sheet of the company. Moreover, the by-laws of each of the Company’s Spanish subsidiaries may provide for additional reserves that must be retained prior to providing funds to it; - restrictions under foreign exchange laws and regulations that could limit or tax the remittance of dividends or transfer payments abroad; and - existing and future contractual restrictions, including restrictions in credit facilities, cash pooling arrangements and other indebtedness that affect the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to it in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The Guarantees provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. However,_ the guarantee of Grupo Antolín Lusitânia—Componentes Automóvel, Unipessoal, Lda. will be limited to a maximum amount of €17.8 million. In addition, the Guarantees of the obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited under the Indenture to an amount that has been determined so as to ensure that amounts payable will not result in violations of laws relating to corporate benefit, capitalization, capital preservation (under which, among others, the risks associated with a guarantee or grant of security on account of a parent company’s debt need to be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the Guarantor’s or grantor’s perspective), thin capitalization, corporate purpose, financial assistance, business rescue proceedings or transactions under value, or otherwise cause the Guarantor to be deemed insolvent under applicable law or such Guarantee to be deemed void, unenforceable or ultra vires, or cause the directors of such Guarantor to be held in breach of applicable corporate, commercial and/or criminal law for providing such Guarantee. If these limitations were not observed, the Guarantees and the grant of security interests by the Guarantors could be subject to legal challenge.

In the case of EURIBOR, this is subject to a zero percent per annum floor, which is deemed to be a “benchmark” and has been the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. 51 ----- Some reforms are already effective including the Benchmarks Regulations and the cessation of the publication of the sterling LIBOR benchmark and the U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmark. Separately, the euro risk free rate working group for the euro area has published a set of guiding principles and high level recommendations for fallback provisions in, among others, new euro denominated cash products (including bonds) referencing EURIBOR. The guiding principles indicate, among others, that continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts (without robust fallback provisions) may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. These reforms and recommendations may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 and the Benchmarks (Amendment and Transitional Provision) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) applies, subject to certain transitional provisions, to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark within Europe and the United Kingdom. Among others, it (i) requires benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU- or UK-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevents certain uses by EU- and UK- supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU- or UK-based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). The Benchmarks Regulation could have a material impact on the Senior Facilities if the methodology or other terms of the benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among others, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the relevant benchmark. More broadly, any of the international or national reforms, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark and complying with any such regulations or requirements. It is not possible to predict with certainty whether, and to what extent, the various benchmarks will continue to be supported going forward. This may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, and may have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Such factors may have (without limitation) the following effects on certain benchmarks: (i) discouraging market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to a benchmark; (ii) triggering changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmark; and/or (iii) leading to the disappearance of the benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international or national reforms or other initiatives or investigations, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported benchmarks, which could have an adverse impact on the interest we pay on borrowings under the Senior Facilities. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, including as a result of changing macro-economic conditions, our interest expense could correspondingly increase, thereby reducing our cash flow and hindering our ability to make payments on the Notes. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. None of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Indenture contains or will contain (as applicable) a covenant requiring us to hedge all or any portion of our floating rate debt. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be or will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms. Hedging itself carries certain risks, including credit risk in relation to such hedging counterparties and the risk that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements. To the extent interest rates were to rise significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, thus reducing cash flow. If one or more of our counterparties falls into bankruptcy, any claims we have under hedging arrangements may become worthless. In addition, in the event that we refinance our debt or otherwise terminate any such hedging agreements, we may be required to make termination payments, which would result in a loss.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to the Notes,13.2.15,Fraudulent conveyance laws may limit your rights as a holder of Notes.,"Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance laws, a court could subordinate or void a Guarantee if it found that: - the Guarantee was incurred with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor; - the Guarantee was granted within two years prior to the insolvency declaration of the Guarantor and it is detrimental for the Guarantor’s state; - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the Guarantee and the Guarantor: 52 ----- - was insolvent or was rendered insolvent because of the Guarantee; - was undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the Guarantee; - intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay at maturity; or - the Guarantee was held to exceed the corporate objects of the relevant Guarantor or not to be in the best interest or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor. The measure of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance laws varies depending on the law applied. Generally, however, a Guarantor would be considered insolvent if it could not pay its debts as they become due. If a court decided that any Guarantee was a fraudulent conveyance and voided such Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you would cease to have any claim in respect of the Guarantor of such Guarantee and would be a creditor solely of the Company and the remaining Guarantors. See “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime”. In an insolvency proceeding, it is possible that creditors of the Guarantors or the appointed insolvency administrator may challenge the Guarantees, and intercompany obligations generally, as fraudulent transfers or conveyances or on other grounds. If so, such laws may permit a court, if it makes certain findings, to: (i) avoid or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Guarantee; (ii) direct that holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors; and (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The Guarantors are organized under the laws of Spain and other jurisdictions. See “Summary—The Offering—Guarantors”. The insolvency laws of these other jurisdictions may not be as favorable to holders of the Notes as the laws of some other jurisdictions with which you may be more familiar. Certain provisions of the insolvency laws in these jurisdictions could affect the ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees or claims relating to the Notes and the Guarantees on an insolvency of the Company or the Guarantors, as the case may be. Under the current Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur and failure to file a petition for insolvency within such statutory two month period may lead to personal liability of the directors for the unpaid claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if the debtor serves notice upon the applicable court of the Opening of Negotiations Communication. The general principle of “no termination effect” (principio general de vigencia de los contratos) is established pursuant to Article 156 of the Spanish Insolvency Law such that agreements remain effective at the time of the insolvency. Therefore, the declaration of insolvency does not impair the existence of the contracts entered into by the debtor, which would remain in force. Any contractual arrangements establishing the termination, suspension or amendment of a contract and/or entitling the relevant creditor to terminate it in the event of the declaration of insolvency of the debtor will be unenforceable. Under Spanish law, a creditor’s rights will be subordinated to the preferential and ordinary debts of a debtor in an insolvency proceeding if such creditor is determined to be a “specially related party” to the debtor. Under Spanish law, factors considered in determining if a party is “specially related party”, among others, are (i) limited liability shareholders holding, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the insolvent company's share capital (or 5% if the company is listed or has securities listed in a secondary official market) at the time when the relevant credit right arises, (ii) directors or liquidators of the debtor (whether de facto or de jure) or have held such position in the two years prior to the insolvency declaration; or or (iii) companies pertaining to the same group as the debtor and their common shareholders provided such shareholders meet the minimum shareholding requirements set forth in (i) above. Additionally, under Spanish law payments made under an equitably subordinated loan preceding the bankruptcy of an obligor may in certain circumstances be clawed back. 53 ----- In order to seek protection against claw back, restructuring plans (out-of-court workouts) may be judicially sanctioned (homologado) by the commercial court that would be competent to conduct an eventual insolvency proceeding of the debtor, upon request by the debtor or by any creditor having entered into such refinancing agreements, if they comply with certain requirements, such as -but not limited to- the following: (i) the debtor is in technical or imminent insolvency, or under likelihood of insolvency, and the plan ensures its viability in the short or medium term; (ii) the restructuring plan affects claims which represent at least 51% of all the liabilities of the debtor (60% in case the clawback protection fall upon financing granted by specially related persons to the debtor); (iii) the restructuring plan is approved by the relevant majorities within the classes of claims (2/3 of the claims in unsecured classes and 3/4 of the claims in secured classes) and approved by all classes (consensual plan) or, if not by all (non-consensual plan), at least by (a) a simple majority of classes, if one of them is composed of claims that could be classified as secured claims or general preferred claims in an insolvency proceeding; or (b) one class of creditors that may reasonably be presumed to have received any payment following an assessment of the debtor as a going concern; (iv) the appointed restructuring expert (or the auditor in case of restructuring plans approved by all classes of claims), issues a certificate acknowledging the sufficiency of the majorities required to homologate the restructuring plan; (v) the restructuring plan has to treat all claims in the same class equally and has to be notified to all affected creditors; (vi) the restructuring plan is formalized before a public notary. Judicially sanctioned refinancing agreements may not be subject to a claw back action, except in the case of fraud of creditors (fraude de acreedores). As to the rules to calculate whether the required thresholds have been reached for a restructuring plan, all creditors holding an interest in a syndicated loan will be deemed to have adhered to the restructuring plan (for the purposes of petitioning protection against claw back) if it is favorably voted upon by at least 75% of the liabilities represented by the loan (assuming it was secured by right-in-rem security interest; or above 66.6% in other cases), or a lower majority if so established in the syndicated loan agreement.

In such a situation, the Company may not have enough funds to pay for all of the Notes that_ are tendered under any such offer.

Additionally, certain change of control events would be prepayment events under the Senior Facilities Agreement. In the event this results in an event of default thereunder, the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement may accelerate such debt, which could also cause an event of default under the Indenture. The change of control provision contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transactions involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a change of control as defined in the Indenture. In addition, the occurrence of certain events that might otherwise constitute a change of control will be deemed not to be a change of control, provided that upon consummation thereof, a specified leverage ratio of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries is met.

Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of a person, and therefore it may be unclear whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

In 2023 we were a leading manufacturer of interior automotive lighting components in Europe, with a market share of overhead front consoles and dome lamps of 31% in 2023, and a relevant supplier in the ambient light segment, especially for premium vehicles. We believe we also had a leading market share in lighting components in North America amounting to approximately 19% for the same year, and a market share in Asia of 4%, which we expect to be a geographical area of focus for the Group in the coming years. As of December 31, 2023, our Technology Solutions segment included 15 manufacturing facilities.

We report net turnover, other operating expenses/income, net, Management segment EBITDA and Management segment EBITDA margin on a segmental basis. The net turnover reported for each segment are those which are directly attributable to the production plants included in that segment for management purposes and therefore also include secondary revenues recognized by said plants in respect of sales for the provision of services to other segments. The income of each segment does not include interest or dividend income or the gains on sales of investments or of non-current assets. The expenses of each segment are calculated as being the expenses arising out of the operating activities of the segment that may be directly attributed to the plants included in that segment for management purposes. The expenses of each segment do not include interest expense, impairments or losses on sales of investments or of non-current assets. Assets and liabilities in the segments are those that are directly connected with the operations of the plants in each segment, although virtually all the financial debt of the Group has been centralized in the corporate unit.

Our business involves significant capital expenditure both on material fixed assets such as property, plant and equipment and on intangible assets mainly linked to R&D. Capital expenditure is essential to maintain our long-term relationships with our clients, which are based on our capacity to offer technologically advanced interior automotive solutions at competitive prices. Capital expenditure on intangible assets is related to innovation in design and materials, so that our products contribute to the perceived value in the interior of the vehicle. Once a project is ongoing, maintenance capital expenditure is limited and somewhat predictable. When new programs or vehicle models are required, usually at the end of a vehicle cycle, “renewal” or “replacement” capital expenditure is required in order to adapt existing infrastructure to accommodate new assembly and process design, usually at levels significantly below the expenditure required to create the capacity in the first place. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment of €120.7 million and capital expenditures in intangible assets of €132.3 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had capital expenditures in property, plant and equipment of €24.3 million and capital expenditures in intangible assets of €28.2 million. Capitalized development expenditures amounted to 75.4% of the cost of our intangible assets as of December 31, 2023 and 74.7% as of March 31, 2024. Among the main additions to development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2024 were projects including Chevrolet “G1Yx (Traverse)”, Porsche “Macan NF PO426 EU22 IP”, Jeep “Cherokee Panel”, Audi “Q7/Q9 Panel”, Mini “F6X EU24 IP”, Cadillac “l232 EV” PlasticP, Ford “Puma Console” and Renault “5 ECHO Panel” projects, for some of which mass production began in 2023. The costs incurred in each development project are capitalized when the following conditions are met: (i) the development cost of the asset can be assessed 65 ----- reliably, (ii) the costs are specifically itemized for each project and correspond to an identifiable asset, (iii) we can prove that the project is technically viable and (iv) the project is likely to generate profits in the future. Once the projects are completed and go into production, capitalized development expenses begin to be amortized. Capitalized development expenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the projects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Our well-diversified customer base, including 100 different automotive brands belonging to approximately 50 OEMs as of December 31, 2023, has limited our exposure to a downturn in the demand for any one OEM’s product portfolio. Regional differences in duration, timing and intensity of economic cycles, combined with the diversity of our geographic footprint, have mitigated the effects of the economic cycle on our business, limiting the impact of our exposure to the cycle in any one region or geography. Our stable revenues have allowed us to take advantage of global growth opportunities, even during economic downturns. The net turnover received from our five largest customers, Volkswagen Group, Stellantis, Ford, Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors—Jaguar Land Rover, represented 65.4% of total net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was lower than the share of our total net turnover from our five largest customers for the year ended December 31, 2022 (67.0%), and 65.7% of the total net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was lower than their relative share of total net turnover for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (67.1%).

The primary materials used in our production facilities are textile fabrics, plastic injection grain, petroleum-based resins and certain metals (primarily copper). For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, the costs of materials and other supplies has represented on average 66.4% of our net turnover. Materials and other supplies, packaging and containers, replacement parts, sundry materials, add-on parts and stocks for resale are valued at the lower of cost applying the weighted average price method, and net realizable value. While prices of materials affect our net turnover and costs, historically, our profit margins have not been significantly affected by changes in prices of materials. We work with a diversified group of suppliers across the world. We try to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation costs. We have not experienced any significant shortages of materials and normally do not carry inventories of such materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production schedules. We estimate that approximately 45% of the value of the materials we source come from suppliers chosen by OEMs, which allows us to benefit from their enhanced negotiation power and to be automatically compensated by the applicable OEM for any increase of material costs. In situations where we renegotiate terms with OEMs in order to pass on cost increases of materials, we must bear the increased costs until the negotiations are finalized, which often takes between three and six months.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

A significant part of our staff costs are semi-variable in nature and can be adjusted to meet business needs. The predictability of our cost-base has assisted our strategic planning and has allowed us to maintain consistent profit margins. We do not have any defined benefit pension, workforce post-retirement health care benefits or employer paid post-retirement basic life insurance benefits obligations. However, some of our subsidiaries forming part of our lighting and Instrument Panels and Central Consoles division have assumed commitments to pay contributions to the retirement pensions of some of their current and former employees. For the year ended December 31, 2023, these commitments primarily affected companies located in Germany, Austria, France, India and the United Kingdom. A significant portion of these commitments has been outsourced and are covered by insurance policies or pension plans with insurance companies. We pay fixed contributions into a fund and are obliged to make additional contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all the employees the benefits to which it has committed. We record the present value of these defined benefit commitments as liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position under “Non-current provisions”, net of the fair value of the assets that meet the requirements to be treated as “assets earmarked for the plan”. The net provision as of December 31, 2023 stood at €17.2 million, comprised of €30.9 million relating to the present value of the defined benefit obligations and €13.7 million relating to the fair value of the pension assets. As of March 31, 2024, the net provision stood at €15.5 million, comprised of €30.9 million relating to the value of the defined benefit obligations at the end of 2023, and €13.7 million relating to the value of the pension assets, and reduced by €1.7 million due to different changes during the first three months of the year.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Vehicle models typically have long, multi-year product life cycles. Given these factors, while the actual revenues which we derive from a project ultimately depend on our OEM customers’ production volumes achieved for the respective car models, we have good visibility on mid-term revenues within a relatively small range of sensitivity. 67 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Typically, in line with our industry practice, we pass on a portion of these production efficiencies to our customers by way of price reductions during the term of the contract. When negotiated price reductions are expected to be retroactive, we accrue for such amounts as a reduction of revenues as products are shipped. To the extent we are not able to achieve the efficiencies necessary to offset the price reductions, such price reductions negatively impact our margins.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.14,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,1152.14.8,Seasonality,"Our business is seasonal. Due to the following factors, our working capital requirements typically increase during the first and third quarters of the year and reduce towards the end of the year. OEMs typically slow down vehicle production during certain portions of the year. For instance, our customers in the United States typically slow down vehicle production during the beginning of the second half of July and August and our European customers slow down vehicle production in August, and both geographies slow down production during the holiday season in December during which they also often conduct internal maintenance and adjustments to inventory. Further, there are a fewer number of working days at the end of the year as opposed to the beginning of a year and this results in a reduction in vehicle production towards the end of such year. Also, we typically agree final due amounts with our suppliers at year-end, which are usually paid at the beginning of the following year, resulting in higher payables at year-end and significant cash outflows during January and February. Further, a significant portion of our tooling receivables balances are invoiced from our clients typically before year-end, resulting in a reduction in receivables and cash inflows at the end of the year. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity may therefore be impacted by these seasonal practices.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1152,OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW AND PROSPECTS,1152.14,Key Factors Affecting our Results of Operations,1152.14.9,Transaction and foreign exchange translation,"Although our reporting currency is the euro, a portion of our sales and operating costs are realized in other currencies, such as among others the U.S. dollar, UK pound, the Brazilian real, the Chinese renminbi, the Indian rupee, the Mexican peso, the Czech crown and the Hungarian forint. Although we have not entered into any foreign-currency hedge rate agreements or forward contracts, we seek a variety of mechanisms to hedge against major movements in currencies, such as using local suppliers and negotiating with customers and suppliers. We may also use a combination of natural hedging techniques and financial derivatives to protect against certain foreign currency exchange rate risks. However, the translation of foreign currencies back to the euro may have a significant impact on our revenues and financial results. Foreign exchange has an unfavorable impact on revenues when the euro is relatively strong as compared with foreign currencies and a favorable impact on revenues when the euro is relatively weak as compared with foreign currencies. The functional currency of our foreign operations is the local currency. The statements of financial position and income statements of the foreign companies included in the scope of consolidation, denominated in currencies other than the euro, were translated to euro using the “closing rate method”. All the assets, rights and obligations of these companies were translated to euro at the applicable year-end exchange rates. Their share capital and reserves were translated at their historical exchange rates. To counteract seasonal effects, the income statement items of these companies were translated to euro at the average exchange rates for the year, based on the volume of transactions performed in each period. The exchange differences arising from the application of these methods are taken to equity under “Remeasurements-Exchange differences” in the consolidated statements of financial position, net of the portion of these differences corresponding to non-controlling interests, which is taken to equity under “Non-controlling interests” in the consolidated statements of financial position. Such translation differences are recognized as income or as expense in the year in which the investment is made or divested. Usually, we do not enter into foreign-currency swap agreements or forward contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2023, an additional 5% rise in the euro against currencies such as the Czech crown, the Brazilian real, the U.S. dollar, the Mexican peso, the UK pound and the Chinese renminbi, would have reduced our net turnover by approximately €128 million.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Our “Product Systems” business encompasses several products such as headliners, doors and hard trim, instrument panels, central consoles, sun visors, window regulators and trunk parts, and is comprised of four divisions: (i) Headliners, (ii) Doors & Hard Trim, (iii) Instrument Panels and Central Consoles and (iv) components & JITs. Our “Technology Solutions” business is comprised of (i) Lighting, (ii) HMI and (iii) Electronics Systems products. As a result of the 2023 Segment Reporting Change, the segmental financial information contained in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, including the prior-year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, give effect to the new split of our business. We did not restate the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 in order to reflect the 2023 Segment Reporting Change and, as a result, the segmental financial information presented in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 (including the prior-year comparative figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021) is therefore not directly comparable to the segmental financial information presented in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (including the prior-year comparative 69 ----- figures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022).

These circumstances were presented as discontinued business operations in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. In accordance with the accounting legislation in force, the Group was required to change the comparative figures in the consolidated income statement for the year ended December 31, 2021, recognize the net result after tax of the discontinued business unit in a single amount, change the comparative figures of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 and report the net change in cash and cash equivalents arising from the discontinued business activities in a single amount. However, since the effects of this reporting were immaterial with respect to the consolidated financial statements as a whole, we decided to maintain the presentation of the income and expenses, and cash inflows and outflows, of these subsidiaries in 2021, in accordance with their nature, and as they were recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 without restating them. As a result, the financial information presented in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 is therefore not directly comparable to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The income tax expense is calculated as the tax payable with respect to the taxable profit for the year, after considering any changes in the assets and liabilities recognized arising from temporary differences and from tax credit and tax loss carry forwards. We consider that a timing difference exists when there is a difference between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base. The tax base for assets and liabilities is treated as the amount attributed to it for tax purposes. A taxable timing difference is understood to be a difference that will generate a future obligation for us to pay taxes to the related tax authorities. A deductible timing difference is one that will generate a right for us to a refund or to make a lower payment to the related tax authorities in the future. Tax credits and deductions and tax loss carry forwards are amounts that, after performance of the activity or obtainment of the profit or loss giving entitlement to them, are not used for tax purposes in the related tax return until the conditions for doing so established in tax regulations are met, provided that we consider it probable that they will be used in future periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the related tax authorities within twelve months from the date they are recognized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the related tax authorities in future years. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. In this regard, a deferred tax liability is recognized for the taxable timing differences resulting from investments in subsidiary companies and associate companies, and from holdings in joint ventures, except when we can control the reversal of the timing differences and they are not expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future. The consolidated companies only recognize deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and tax loss carry forwards to the extent that it is probable that they will have sufficient future taxable profits against which these assets can be utilized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability (other than in a business combination) that at the time of recognition affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized are reassessed each year in order to ascertain whether they still exist, and the appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Our ability to generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors. Additionally, for liquidity management, our goal is to maintain flexible financing, through the availability of contracted credit facilities or factoring lines with or without recourse (through which we transfer our receivables to third parties). As of March 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents amounted to €240.8 million. Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, we had available revolving credit facilities totaling €127.8 million, which consisted of €59.1 million under our Revolving Credit Facility (with €130.0 million thereunder drawn as of the same date) and €68.7 million under other credit lines (with €16.6 million thereunder drawn as of the same date). Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings and cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due or to fund our other liquidity needs. We believe that the potential risks to our liquidity include: - a reduction in operating cash flows due to a lowering of operating profit from our operations, which could be caused by a downturn in our performance or in the industry as a whole; - the failure or delay of our customers to make payments due to us; 85 ----- - a failure to maintain low working capital requirements; and - the need to fund expansion and other development capital expenditures. Our “free cash flow” is calculated by deducting from our total net cash flows from operating activities our capital expenditures (which represent expenditures in property plant and equipment, plus expenditures in intangible assets). For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our “free cash flow” amounted to €37.1 million, compared to €14.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.1,Introduction,18.1.1,,"The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, sells and services motor vehicles which are usually classified into either (i) light vehicles or (ii) heavy commercial vehicles. The light vehicle segment of the automotive industry is comprised of passenger cars, vans and light trucks with a gross vehicle weight of less than six tons, while the heavy commercial vehicle segment of the automotive industry consists of vehicles with a gross vehicle weight six tons or more. The automotive production value chain is split between OEMs such as Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan and Ford and automotive suppliers, such as Bosch, Continental, Magna and Antolin. Automotive suppliers are then generally further categorized into three different tiers as follows: - _Tier 1: these suppliers, such as Antolin, sell their products directly to OEMs. Typically, these products are larger modules or systems which integrate components, sometimes sourced from Tier 2 automotive suppliers. - _Tier 2: they provide individual components or component groups. - _Tier 3: in turn, a further layer of Tier 3 suppliers produces individual parts which are typically integrated by Tier 2 suppliers. A clear delineation of the suppliers as Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3 is not always possible because suppliers often manufacture and sell numerous products or product groups. Automotive suppliers are typically further divided into sub-segments based on their components’ function within vehicles. Each of these sub-segments is comprised of various product groups. A typical classification of automotive suppliers by vehicle function could include the following sub-segments: powertrain, body and structural, electronics, interior, transmission, suspension, climate control, wheels and tires, steering, fuel systems, passenger restraints, audio and telematics, exhaust and body glass. There are many different market leaders in the respective market niches. Consequently, a consistent definition of these niche markets rarely exists and it is very difficult to determine the market position of an individual supplier using objective criteria. As an automotive supplier of interior components, our net turnover is linked to the development of automotive production numbers and changes in the content per vehicle for the components we produce.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.2,Overview of and Key Trends in the Interior Components Market,18.2.1,,"We mainly act as a supplier to OEMs in the interior components market. The interior market comprises all the products and components that form the cabin interior of a vehicle and surround its driver and passengers. As such, interior components have a direct effect on driver and passenger comfort and safety and are therefore important components that allow OEMs to differentiate between vehicle models. Products in this category typically include, among others, instrument panels, arm and head rests, headliners, door panels, carpeting and floor covers, glove boxes, sun visors, interior panels, power controls, ashtrays, air outlets, handles, sound deadeners and horn pads. 91 ----- Key trends in the interior component market include higher consumer expectations of interior comfort, and demand for a higher standard of vehicle interior content. Interior styling is the one of the most important purchasing factors influencing vehicle selection. The trend towards higher consumer expectations of interior content increases demand for features such as improved fit, finish, craftsmanship and more recently, sustainability in interiors across all vehicle types. We believe OEMs are dedicating a larger portion of their total spend per vehicle to interior components as they “upscale” vehicle interiors in order to adapt to this trend across their entire portfolio of platforms, from compact to sports utility vehicles to luxury vehicles. Suppliers with advanced design, materials and manufacturing capabilities to deliver a broad suite of interior component products across a wide range of price points should benefit from this continued focus on interior comfort and craftsmanship by both consumers and OEMs. Additionally, OEMs are driven by regulatory changes and consumer preferences to invest heavily in environmental initiatives such as fuel efficiency, reduced emissions and overall environmental friendliness, including recycling. See “— _Market and Industry Trend.” This creates a need for interior components that are lighter-weight, have improved acoustical_ performance and are environmentally friendly, and will continue to provide an opportunity for differentiation for interior component supplier as OEMs strive to reduce the ecological footprint of their vehicles. The automotive interior market has undergone substantial changes over recent years. Following the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, vehicle production significantly decreased, which detrimentally affected the financial condition of many OEMs and, consequently, many automotive suppliers. Supply chain disruptions followed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and were further exacerbated by the military invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation in February 2022, which in turn accelerated surging commodity prices and general inflationary pressures. In addition to this, labor shortages, sustained inflation and rising interest rates, as well as an ongoing shift in the powertrain and digitalization technologies within automotive engineering, have added to the increased pressure faced by automotive suppliers. As a result, OEMs, especially the challengers in China, have emerged as stalwarts with sustained growth in production and growing demand driven by cost advantages and improved production quality.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

In recent years, the market share of low-cost passenger cars has been increasing, predominantly in China, India, Brazil and Eastern Europe, and sales of small passenger cars are expected to grow further. These cars are mainly manufactured and sold in high-growth countries in APAC, as well as in Brazil and Eastern Europe. Growth in the premium segment is also expected to be driven by emerging markets, including China, India and Africa. Vehicles in the premium segment tend to be more technologically advanced in each sub-segment of automotive components, including the interior components segment.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Market and Industry Trends,18.3.2,Stricter carbon dioxide emission regulations and other regulatory and demand drivers worldwide are forcing OEMs to improve fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness of vehicles,"The development and production of more fuel-efficient vehicles is a key growth trend in the automotive sector. Such trend is driven by consumers’ preference to save money on fuel and regulatory factors. Furthermore, sustainability has become a strategic priority for the automotive industry. Increasing social and environmental awareness among end consumers is expected to play a greater role in vehicle purchase decisions. Consequently, OEMs face ongoing pressure to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles and thereby reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The regulatory obligation to improve the efficiency of existing technologies and to develop new environmentally friendly technologies aimed at reducing fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions is becoming a key focus for OEMs, given stringent carbon dioxide consumption and emission standards throughout the industrial world, including in Europe, the United States, China and Japan. 92 ----- The development and production of innovative components and systems contributing to emission reduction is a key growth area in the automotive sector. Many countries have adopted emission regulations which set limits on the amount of pollutants that new vehicles can emit. These regulations limit, among others, the emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate matter, all of which are considered harmful to human health. Within the next several years, emission limits worldwide are expected to become increasingly restrictive given growing environmental awareness. Regulations have been adopted in both developed and emerging markets. For instance, Brazil, India and China tend to adopt similar regulations a few years after such regulations have been approved in Europe. The emission limits for nitrogen oxides and particulate matters emitted by diesel vehicles are expected to face the most substantial reductions. In the European Union, for example, the regulatory standard Euro 6, which became compulsory for all new passenger cars in 2015, reduced the emission limit of nitrogen oxides for diesel vehicles from 180 mg/km today to 80 mg/km. Passenger car carbon dioxide regulation limits are expected to decrease from 130 g/km in 2015 to approximately 50 g/km between 2030 and 2034. The tightening of emission regulation worldwide is expected to drive demand for more eco-friendly products, thereby forcing OEMs and suppliers to develop innovative components and systems which comply with the more restrictive emission legislation.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Market and Industry Trends,18.3.3,Increasing number of electric and hybrid cars as sustainable vehicles are the future of transportation,"Consumers are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious, which is affecting their vehicle purchase choice. The production of electric and hybrid vehicles has increased, with hybrid vehicles being more popular than purely electric vehicles. Despite the fact that the rates of adoption of these vehicles has, to date, been relatively slow (largely due to their relatively high price and, with respect to purely electric vehicles, short driving range and the lack of battery re-charging infrastructure) in the last few years, a significant transformation has occurred in the motor vehicle landscape. Electric cars, which used to be a fringe choice in a market otherwise dominated by major global automakers, are rapidly becoming mainstream. Several start-ups are currently developing electric vehicle offerings driven by rising environmental consciousness, as well as subsidies from local and national governments which are offering various forms of rebates and credits for the purchase of an electric vehicle, and have also begun to support the rise of e-mobility by accelerating the push for zero emission vehicles due to increased awareness of the impacts of global warming. The chart below shows the evolution of global electrified stock from 2019 to 2023, during which global electrified stock grew globally at a CAGR of 54% overall: Source: International Energy Agency 93 ----- Notwithstanding the above, it is expected to be a number of years before battery technology is sufficiently improved and becomes affordable for mainstream use in automobiles. Moreover, it is expected that it will also take time to develop charging stations to support these types of vehicles. Once these obstacles have been overcome, take up of both hybrid and electric cars is expected to further accelerate. At this stage, we are likely to see an increase in the number of automotive suppliers who manufacture electric motors, advanced automotive batteries as well as semiconductors, connectors and sensors designed for electrical vehicles. Furthermore, the transition from internal combustion engines to electric powertrains has resulted in significant efforts to reduce the weight of vehicles. Sustainability considerations are also factors that drive up the importance of lightweight materials in the automotive industry. Therefore, manufacturers are forced to compensate for the increase in weight of power systems by reducing the weight of other subsystems such as interiors, body and chassis, and suspension, among others.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Market and Industry Trends,18.3.6,The regional shift of the automotive industry is expected to continue to intensify with the continuing increase in demand for vehicles in emerging markets,"While vehicle production demand has fluctuated across the global economy in recent years, particularly at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, as well as during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, on a normalized level, the demand in emerging economies has generally continued to increase. Industry sources forecast that in the years leading up to 2028, there will be a higher CAGR of sales in large and highly populated countries such as India, as well as in other emerging economies, compared to Western Europe in general. In response to this trend, OEMs continue to develop their presence in these markets, resulting in an increased need for OEMs to establish supplier networks beyond their home markets, including the migration of component and vehicle design, development and engineering activities to certain of these markets. In certain of these markets, such as China, there is already significant demand for new, premium brand vehicle models. Nevertheless, vehicle demand in these emerging economies is predominantly for less advanced models with lower entry-level price points. This increasing local demand of emerging markets has helped boost the local automotive industry in these countries and has attracted investments in manufacturing from North American, European and APAC based automobile manufacturers, through stand-alone investments and joint ventures with local partners. The evolution of volume demand in these markets is happening at the same time as an evolution of regulatory and industry standards modelled after those set earlier by more mature economies.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Product Systems,18.8.1,Headliners,"An overhead system comprises the headliner as well as all the components associated with it. Headliners conceal roof sheet metal, wiring and safety airbags and incorporate interior components, thus improving the perceived quality of the vehicle by the eventual vehicle owner. Our headliner product is a composite material that is affixed to the inside of the metal panel of a vehicle’s roof. The headliner is a fundamental aspect of a vehicle’s design and functionality and plays an important role in the aesthetics, comfort, safety and acoustics of the vehicle. From the start of our business, our overhead systems have identified us on a global scale as a pioneer in the R&D of such technologies. Overhead systems can be adapted to different configurations, from the simplest headliners through to the most complex modular integration. Our components include: substrate, sun visors, consoles, lighting, grab handles, air conditioning vents and solar protection systems. We develop technological solutions to account for key factors such as head impact regulations and the integration of fabric and lighting elements. The extensive offer meets the requirements of all segments available in the market. _Manufacturing process_ We begin the production process of our headliners by analyzing our customer’s requirements as well as the features and components that will be incorporated into the headliner. Our technical departments determine the ideal material construction and technology to produce the headliner at the most competitive cost and our engineering team then builds the detailed 3D specifications of the product. Once the part has been engineered, we begin the manufacturing process. We manufacture our headliners using two production techniques: thermosetting technology and thermoplastic technology. Thermosetting technology uses a multi-layered composite structure (combining a core of polyurethane foam and layers of adhesive, glass fiber and an aesthetical cover) which is converted into a rigid product using a heating process, while thermoplastic technology uses a board of a fibrous material which is heated in a specialized oven and then pressed into its final shape using a cooling process. The core material of the headliner is polyurethane foam. Manufacturing the foam is integrated in every production facility allowing us to customize the properties of the foam in accordance with customer specifications to achieve certain density, mechanical and acoustic requirements. The foam is created in large blocks which are then cut down in size to the required dimension and thickness. Once the foam is cut into the appropriate dimensions, it is coated with adhesive, a catalyst is sprayed over the foam, then two layers of glass fiber are placed on and underneath the foam. Finally, a backing layer, either fleece or paper, is placed on the bottom side and an aesthetical layer, a textile or carpet, is placed on the upper side in order to create the final “sandwich” structure. The graphic below illustrates the final “sandwich” product: The formed “sandwich” is then transferred into a heated tool to shape the headliner. After forming the headliner, it is trimmed using a pressurized water stream or with special die-cut tooling. In the thermoplastic stage, our thermoplastic technology processes boards of fibrous materials which are blends of polyester or polypropylene fibers with glass fibers by heating the boards in an infra-red oven and then molding the boards in a cold press while, at the same time, feeding the interior textile finish into the mold. Finally, the part is trimmed by water jet. The thermoplastic lines are fully automatic, reducing labor 107 ----- costs and boosting the competitiveness of this technology. Following customer and market demands, we have developed different technologies to assemble various components, such as sunroof frames, console frames, fixing or locator features on the back of the headliner. These components can be incorporated during the forming or covering steps or in a specific additional tooling. As of December 31, 2023, the production process for our Headliners division is spread out across over 36 facilities worldwide. _Customers and competitors_ We sell our overhead systems globally and our main clients consist of most OEMs worldwide, including Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen Group, Renault-Nissan and Stellantis, among others.

We provide OEMs with a final product which combines technical features with design while at the same time reducing the industrial complexity of the assembly chain. A door panel is composed of several parts and each of them uses a different technology and production process. The first step of production is generally either injection molding or thermoplastic processing. Injection molding consists of plastic material being melted in order to fill a mold which is then cooled to solidify the panel. Door panels constructed using thermoplastic are produced with a thermoplastic shell, which is heated in an oven or a press machine and a mold. Once the plastic component is finalized, a variety of covering technologies are utilized to cover the part with leather or fabric. The technologies used for the covering process include vacuum technology, edge wrapping and laser cutting which allows designs to be laser cut into the final product. Once all the individual parts are produced, they must be assembled together. The assembly process can be done in one of our production plants or can be done, totally or just partially, in a JIT facility close to the assembly plant of the customer to reduce logistic cost. 108 ----- As of December 31, 2023, the production process for our Doors & Hard Trim division is spread out across 31 facilities worldwide. _Customers and competitors_ We sell our doors and interior plastics products in Europe & ROW, North America and Asia, particularly in China.

For the year ended December 31, 2023, our top five OEM customers accounted 65.4% of our net turnover. The most significant increases from our key customers since January 1, 2023 have come from Renault-Nissan, which accounted for 5.0% of our total net turnover for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 4.3% for the year ended December 31, 2022. We have developed long-standing business relationships with our automotive customers around the world. We work together with our customers along the full value chain, including development, industrial engineering, tooling and manufacturing. Quality assurance programs matching the highest standards underlie our service offering. In emerging economies in particular, our customers are focusing their own resources on vehicle assembly and seek to outsource to suppliers that are capable of providing an integrated supply service. We believe that our customers perceive us as a supplier that is capable on a global scale of providing (i) high-quality products at competitive prices with standardized high-level quality; (ii) innovative solutions for complex projects and (iii) on-time delivery and quality customer service. Mandates in the automotive OEM business involve long-term production arrangements based on the lifecycle of the specific model or platform. As a result of our strategic and long-term relationships with our OEM customers, and given the prohibitive operational, technical and logistical costs of switching suppliers, particularly during the life cycle of a specific vehicle model, we have strong visibility on our mid-term revenues. Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our strong customer relationships to obtain similar awards in the future. In addition to being diversified, our customer base is weighted towards premium and financially stable OEMs, meaning that, subject to the stage of the automotive industry cycle and prevailing macroeconomic conditions, our revenue streams are relatively secure. Our geographical diversification strategy is aligned with the ongoing expansion by OEMs into emerging economies and the consolidation of their existing presence in established markets. As OEMs have sought to establish presence in growth markets and to grow outside of their home markets, we have adapted our geographical diversification strategy to focus less on our presence in Western Europe, which is well established, and more on these growing markets. 112 ----- While we continue to pursue a measured strategy of geographical diversification, the basis of our technological expertise is in Western Europe, with growing support teams in Asia and North America in order to better understand local needs in these markets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

We consider innovation and R&D to be key success factors in the differentiation of our products and services from those of our competitors. One of the global trends in the automotive industry is the increased focus on innovative and technologically advanced products that seek to address the parallel concerns of improved safety for passengers and road users and the reduction of weight and emissions. Our commitment to developing innovative, high quality products has defined our approach to our customers. Investment in R&D is one of our main drivers. Through the development of our innovation programs, we contribute to the objectives of Grupo Antolin to prepare for the exciting future that the automotive sector has ahead: - To increase the added value of the company's current products and simultaneously be able to access new product ranges with greater technological sophistication. - To improve our technical and industrial capacities in order to prepare for future mobility trends, as well as to improve our market position as suppliers of high technological content. - To differentiate Grupo Antolin’s offer with respect to its competitors by introducing innovations that allow optimization of costs, technical performance, functionality, comfort and perceived quality inside the vehicle. - To improve aspects of industrial flexibility and efficiency, helping to implement advanced manufacturing tools in order to ensure the competitive strength of Grupo Antolin to face the current situation of uncertainty in the automotive market. - To contribute to the fulfilment of the environmental commitments that affect the sector, including emission reductions in the coming years, as well as the implementation of circular economy characteristics that are becoming increasingly necessary. The innovation strategy designed to achieve these objectives includes the development of open innovation initiatives. In this regard, during 2023 our innovation and advanced engineering teams have been focusing on a broad number of technologies, including the Antolin VIVAR virtual concept car, which can be accessed with facial recognition, the prototype of an interior sanitization system, an AI-based optimization of the car user experience, a lighting system improving the comfort and safety of night driving, a new sustainable compound material and a plant-based alternative to leather lining. During the first half of 2024, we have also presented two new mono-material solutions enabling full recycling, an innovative door panel concept and a new horizon of integration for cockpits in collaboration with VIA optronics. Additionally, the company has continued to focus on a number of strategies aimed at further positioning ourselves as a leading integrator of innovative technologies applied to interiors, including: - Attracting talent, knowledge and skills with which to face the challenges affecting the sector; - Expanding our innovation ecosystem, consolidating external technical support teams, as well as new collaboration models and alliances; and - Conceiving new solutions to enhance our products and processes. The strategy also considers the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies and R&D organizations. In 2023, collaborative agreements were established with VIA optronics AG, Biometric Vox, e2ip and WalterPack alliance. 113 ----- At Grupo Antolin, we carry out our R&D work through a rigorous process called “Innovation Development Process.” This development involves a multi-stage process aimed at turning ideas into innovations that can ultimately be commercialized. The initial stage of the process is designed to foster generation of ideas and includes, among others: identification, understanding and analysis of social, digital, demographic, regulatory, industry and other trends which may create demand for, and thus drive development of new automotive technologies, competitive intelligence, technological observation, freedom-to-operate analysis, review of academic research and automotive customer input. Concepts that progress past this initial stage are further evaluated, including with respect to commercialization opportunities, as well as potential risks and challenges to further development. Winning innovations progress through subsequent stages towards product or process realization, validation and, eventually, product launch. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we incurred €118.2 million, or 2.6% of our net turnover, in R&D. Our innovative products and market leading processes are developed through our targeted R&D platforms across R&D centers throughout Europe, Asia, North America and South America. Underlying our innovative products and processes and in-house capabilities is the maintenance of rigorous quality management and testing systems in all of our manufacturing plants and R&D facilities. Through regular internal audits we are able to ensure that our products and processes are monitored to the highest industry standards. We believe that these competencies and capabilities along the entire value chain give us a competitive advantage over many of the other suppliers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The breakdown of our employees by business segment as of December 31, 2023 is as follows: approximately 76% in Product Systems, and approximately 12% in Technology Solutions. Our strategy is to manage relations with our employees primarily on a plant level, with the “plant works council” being the forum for employee representation most favored by our employees. As a general rule, each plant has its own collective agreement. This policy allows us to benefit from a number of advantages: - collective agreements are adapted to the specific circumstances and needs of each plant (for example different geographic areas within a country may have different average salary or cost of living allowances); - collective agreements can be adapted to the economic performance and productivity of each plant; and - workers identify themselves better with their own “plant works council” rather than with a country level one. In addition to this strategy, we try to build open and trusting relations with union representatives at regional level or country level, in order to allow a bi-directional communication channel to provide them with relevant information, but also to understand their real worries and concerns. Where necessary and where the legal and regulatory labor and employment framework in a jurisdiction allows, we have implemented measures such as temporary reduction of the workforce, early retirement programs (as a way to achieve cost reduction in the short-term and to reduce the average age of the staff in the medium to long-term) and “substitute contracts”, which have proven to be an efficient way to manage costs and rejuvenate the workforce, while accommodating the aging population. 116 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

This section is intended to be a summary only and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of the topics summarized. Terms not defined in the following section have the meanings given to them in the Senior Facilities Agreement._ Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. is a party to a senior term and revolving facilities agreement dated March 13, 2014, as amended and/or amended and restated on June 4, 2015, October 26, 2016, April 27, 2018, June 3, 2020, May 20, 2021, August 27, 2021, December 22, 2021, December 7, 2022 and most recently pursuant to the ARA (the “Senior Facilities Agreement”) entered into between, among others, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. as the company and original borrower (the “Company”), the original lenders listed therein and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as agent (“Agent”) and security agent. _Facilities_ After giving effect to the A&E pursuant to the ARA on the A&E Effective Date, the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for committed facilities as set out below: - a euro term loan facility (“Facility A”) in an aggregate amount of €338.1 million, comprising (i) a tranche in an aggregate principal amount of €8.6 million (“Facility A1”) with an amortizing repayment profile (as set out below) maturing on March 31, 2026 (the “Original Maturity Date”) and (ii) a tranche in an aggregate principal amount of €329.5 million (“Facility A6”) with an amortizing repayment profile (as set out below) maturing on the Extended Maturity Date (as defined below); and - a multi-currency revolving credit facility with total commitments of €193.6 million (€4.5 million of which has been utilized as ancillary facilities) (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) comprising (i) a tranche in an aggregate principal amount of €8.9 million which matures on the Original Maturity Date (“RCF1”) and (ii) a tranche in an aggregate principal amount of €184.7 million to be established and made available pursuant to the ARA upon the occurrence of the A&E Effective Date which matures on the Extended Maturity Date (“RCF2”). Following the A&E Effective Date, each of Facility A6 and RCF2 will have an extended maturity date of June 30, 2029 (subject to a springing maturity to October 29, 2027, if the 2028 Notes are not refinanced in full on or prior to October 29, 2027) (the “Extended Maturity Date”). If the Company and a lender under the Revolving Credit Facility agrees, a lender under the Revolving Credit Facility may provide all or part of its Revolving Credit Facility commitments as an Ancillary Facility (as defined under the Senior Facilities Agreement) on such terms and conditions as may be agreed between the Company and the relevant lender thereunder. Such Ancillary Facility can be in the form of, among others, overdraft facility, guarantee or bonding facility, letter of credit or any other facility or accommodation required in connection with the business. Ancillary Facilities may not be available for cash drawings. _Interest rates and fees_ The interest rate on each loan under the Senior Facilities Agreement for each interest period is the rate per annum which is the aggregate of the applicable (a) margin (as described below) and (b) in relation to any loan in euro, EURIBOR. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and following the A&E Effective Date, the margin for (i) Facility A1 and RCF1 ranges from 1.80% to 2.50% per annum, and (ii) Facility A6 and RCF2 ranges from 2.50% per annum to 4.00% per annum, in each case subject to a margin adjustment mechanism in the Senior Facilities Agreement pursuant to which the margin applicable to Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facility is adjusted upwards or downwards based on the ratio of Net Financial Indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) in respect of any relevant testing period, as demonstrated in the compliance certificate required delivered with the annual audited and quarterly unaudited financial statements of the Group. While an event of default is continuing under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the applicable margin will be the highest margin applicable to each Facility. In addition, the margin for RCF1 and RCF2 is subject to a separate margin adjustment mechanism whereby the margin can be adjusted upwards or downwards by, in each case, 0.025% per annum (but, in each case, will never be reduced or increased by more than 0.025% per annum) based on the 122 ----- compliance or non-compliance with certain sustainability performance indicators as set out in the Group’s non-financial annual report (the relevant provisions in the Senior Facilities Agreement being the “Sustainability Provisions”).

Pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay certain fees, including an agency and security agent’s fee and a commitment fee in respect of the available but undrawn Revolving Credit Facility commitments. _Guarantees_ Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company (together with the Company, the “SFA Guarantors”) guarantee all amounts due to the lenders and other finance parties under the Senior Facilities Agreement and related finance documents. The guarantees granted by the SFA Guarantors are subject to certain guarantee limitations which are set out in the Senior Facilities Agreement, or in the case of the Portuguese Guarantors, in the Intercreditor Agreement. These guarantee limitations primarily limit the scope of the guarantees granted by the SFA Guarantors to ensure that they comply with the laws of the jurisdictions in which the SFA Guarantors are incorporated. The Company is required to ensure that each of its subsidiaries in which it holds directly or indirectly at least 90% of the issued ordinary share capital, and which for the last financial year has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (i) calculated on the same basis as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) but on an unconsolidated basis, representing 2.50% or more of the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and (ii) (calculated on the same basis as Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) but on an unconsolidated basis) greater than €5,000,000 (a company meeting these criteria being a “Material Company”), accedes to the Senior Facilities Agreement as an additional guarantor as soon as possible after becoming a Material Company.

The Second Share Pledges over the shares held by Castilfalé Gestión, S.A.U. remain effective and the obligations under the corresponding security documents relating to such shares are legal, valid, binding and enforceable against HoldCo following such merger. The First Share Pledges and the Second Share Pledges secure obligations owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement and related finance documents and the 2028 Notes. The security created by the First Share Pledges and the Second Share Pledges rank in the order described in the section titled “Intercreditor Agreement” below. _Undertakings_ The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain negative undertakings that, subject to certain customary and other agreed exceptions, limit the ability of each obligor (and in certain cases, members of the Group) to, among others: - incur or allow remaining outstanding financial indebtedness (with the capacity to incur indebtedness to be increased by an additional €50 million pursuant to the A&E on the A&E Effective Date); 123 ----- - be a creditor in respect of financial indebtedness; - create or permit to subsist any security over any of its assets; - issue or allow to remain outstanding any guarantee in respect of any liability or obligation owed to any person; - declare or pay any dividend or other payment or distribution of any kind on or in respect of any of its shares (with an additional restriction included in the ARA pursuant to which no dividends shall be paid by the Company during the period from the A&E Effective Date to and including December 31, 2026 (the “2024 Restriction”) (but for the avoidance of doubt, any amount that would have been permitted to be paid as dividend under the Senior Facilities Agreement but for the 2024 Restriction shall be permitted to be paid in subsequent financial years falling after December 31, 2026 as long as no Event of Default (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) is outstanding and the specified leverage condition is met at the time of such payment); and - make acquisitions of companies, businesses or undertakings.

The proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or any guarantees granted in respect of the Senior Secured Debt and all other amounts paid to the Security Agent under the Intercreditor Agreement shall be applied in the following order: - first, in payment on a pari passu and pro rata basis any sums (including fees, costs, expenses and liabilities) owing to (i) the Security Agent or any receiver, delegate, attorney or agent appointed under the Transaction Security documents or the Intercreditor Agreement; (ii) the Agent or any creditor representative in its capacity as such in respect of any Additional Senior Financing; and (iii) the trustee(s) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes; - second, on a pari passu and pro rata basis to the (i) Agent on its own behalf and on behalf of the creditors under the Senior Facilities Agreement; (ii) the trustee(s) on their own behalf and on behalf of the relevant noteholders of the Senior Secured Notes; and (iii) any creditor representative in respect of an Additional Senior Financing on its own behalf and on behalf of the creditors under such Additional Senior Financing, for application towards the discharge of amounts owed under the Senior Facilities Agreement (in accordance with the terms thereof), and any Additional Senior Financing (on a pro rata basis); 127 ----- - third, if none of the debtors is under any further actual or contingent liability under any of the Senior Secured Debt documents, in payment to any person the Security Agent is obliged to pay in priority to any debtor; and - fourth, in payment or distribution to the relevant debtors. _Distressed disposals_ A “Distressed Disposal” means a disposal effected (i) by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security; (ii) at the request of the Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable; or (iii) by HoldCo (in the case of a disposal of the secured shares) or a debtor to a third party (not being a member of the Group) after any of the Senior Secured Debt has been accelerated. If to the extent permitted by applicable law a Distressed Disposal is being effected or the shares of the Company are being appropriated by the Security Agent, the Security Agent is authorized (without the requirement to obtain any further consent or authorization from any Senior Secured Creditor or other relevant party): (i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over any asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or appropriation; and (ii) if the asset subject to the Distressed Disposal or appropriation is the shares of a Group company, to release such Group Company and/or its subsidiaries from any liabilities under borrowings and/or guarantees under the Senior Secured Debt documents, intra-Group debt documents or documents evidencing Equity Investor Liabilities. _Intra-Group debt_ Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Company and its subsidiaries party thereto that are creditors in respect of intra-Group debt over a certain threshold have agreed to subordinate intra-Group debt to the Senior Secured Debt. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries that are creditors in respect of intra-Group debt may accept the benefit of any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of intra-Group debt unless such action is permitted under the Senior Secured Debt documents. Neither the Company nor any other subsidiary may make any payment, prepayment, repayment or otherwise acquire or discharge any intra-Group debt if acceleration action has been taken in respect of any of the Senior Secured Debt unless the Instructing Group consent or such action is undertaken to facilitate repayment or prepayment of the Senior Secured Debt. _Equity Investor Liabilities_ Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Company and future equity investors party thereto have agreed to subordinate the Equity Investor Liabilities to the Senior Secured Debt. The Company and other debtors may make payments in respect of the Equity Investor Liabilities provided that such payments are permitted under the terms of the Senior Secured Debt documents and the documents evidencing the Equity Investor Liabilities. No equity investor may accept the benefit of any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of Equity Investor Liabilities prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Secured Debt has been discharged. _Turnover_ Subject to certain exceptions, if any creditor party to the Intercreditor Agreement (including the Agent, Security Agent, the Trustee (including the trustees under the Indenture and the 2028 Notes Indenture, respectively), Senior Secured Creditors, creditors in respect of intra-Group debt and creditors in respect of Equity Investor Liabilities) receives or recovers a payment (whether by way of direct payment, set-off or otherwise) except as permitted pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, such creditor shall hold such payment in trust for the Security Agent and promptly pay over such amounts to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provision described above under “Enforcement and application of proceeds”.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The 2028 Notes are admitted to the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for trading on the Euro MTF Market. The 2028 Notes are senior obligations of the Company and are guaranteed jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by each of the Guarantors and the Company. _Interest Rate_ The 2028 Notes accrue interest at a rate of 3.500% per annum and mature on April 30, 2028. Interest on the 2028 Notes is payable in cash semi-annually on April 30 and October 31 of each year, commencing October 31, 2021. _Prepayments and redemptions_ At any time prior to April 30, 2024, the Company may redeem all or part of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes redeemed plus a “make whole” premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. At any time on or after April 30, 2024, the Company may redeem all or part of the 2028 Notes at a redemption price (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, at the redemption date. The redemption prices are 101.7500%, 100.8750% and 100.000%, for years 2024, 2025 and 2026 and thereafter, respectively. At any time prior to April 30, 2024, the Company may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 103.500% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the redemption date, provided that at least 60% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2028 Notes remains outstanding after the redemption. The Company may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time, if changes in tax laws would require the Company to pay additional amounts on the 2028 Notes. If the Company decides to redeem the 2028 Notes following such a change in tax laws, the Company must redeem all the 2028 Notes at a price equal to the principal amount of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption. If the Company experiences specific kinds of changes in control specified in the 2028 Notes Indenture, it may be required to offer to repurchase the 2028 Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. _Certain covenants and Events of Default_ The 2028 Notes Indenture contains a number of covenants that, among others, restricts, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to: - incur additional indebtedness - create liens; - pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make certain other restricted payments or investments; - enter into agreements that restrict dividends from restricted subsidiaries; - sell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries; - engage in transactions with affiliates; and - effect a consolidation or merger.

However, under the circumstances described below under the subheading “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”, the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries”. The Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. 131 ----- Not all of our Subsidiaries will initially guarantee the Notes. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of any non-guarantor Subsidiaries, these Subsidiaries will pay the holders of their debt and their trade creditors before they will be able to distribute any of their assets to the Company. The Guarantors will consist of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries incorporated in the Czech Republic, Germany, Mexico, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, which will guarantee the Notes from the Issue Date. The guarantee of the Notes by any Guarantor incorporated in Portugal will not be included in the Indenture and will instead be granted pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Guarantors, together with the Company, represent 54.3% and 64.2% of the Group’s total Consolidated EBITDA and revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024, respectively. In addition, the subsidiaries of the Company that will not guarantee the Notes would have had €21.8 million of debt outstanding as of March 31, 2024 on a consolidated basis, as adjusted for the Transactions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness”. In addition, pursuant to the covenant entitled “—Additional Note Guarantees”, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Agreed Security Principles and certain exceptions, any Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees certain Indebtedness of other entities will also be required to enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor and accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Note Guarantees are joint and several obligations of the Guarantors. The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Note Guarantee pursuant to the guarantee limitations and the Agreed Security Principles and in order to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. In addition, the guarantees of Grupo Antolín Lusitânia-Componentes Automóvel Unipessoal LDA under the Indenture, the Existing Notes, the Senior Facilities, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility will be limited to an aggregate of €17.8 million.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a Change of Control Payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to the date of such repurchase.

The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes and the related Note Guarantees as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Company.

The provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control Triggering Event, the Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require the Company to repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer. The Company also will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control Triggering Event if it has theretofore issued a redemption notice in respect of all of the Notes in the manner and in accordance with the provisions described under “—Optional Redemption” and thereafter purchases all of the Notes pursuant to such notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control Triggering Event at the time of making the Change of Control Offer. If holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any third-party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Company or such third party will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon, to, but excluding the date of redemption. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Company to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a holder of Notes may require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. 142 ----- Subject to the covenants described below, the Company could enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations which, though not constituting a Change of Control Triggering Event under the Indenture, could increase the amount of outstanding debt or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings.

If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made by any applicable law or regulation or otherwise as described under “Description of the Notes—Additional _Amounts”, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Notes—Additional Amounts”, the Issuer will pay Additional_ Amounts as may be necessary in order for the net amounts received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the case may be, absent such withholding or deduction.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers as discussed in “Transfer Restrictions.” 191 ----- Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to the transfer restrictions. Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S, Rule 144A or any other exemption (if available) under the U.S. Securities Act. In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A BookEntry Interest, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Euroclear has advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests for a Definitive Registered Note and not only to the owner who made the initial request. In such an event, the Issuer will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” unless that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law. To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrar and the Transfer Agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time on the register maintained by the Registrar, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes. In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, 192 ----- and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable; provided that no Definitive Registered Note in a denomination less than €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000, in excess thereof, will be issued. The Issuer will bear the cost of preparing, printing, packaging and delivering the Definitive Registered Notes. Holders of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of a Transfer Agent, the Issuer will issue and the Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and the Issuer’s requirements are met. The Issuer or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond or security sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and the Issuer to protect the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar and the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The Issuer, the Registrar and/or the Trustee may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note. In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by the Issuer pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be. We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream. Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,21,DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES,21.41,Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System,21.41.5,Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream,"The following description of the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent nor the Initial Purchasers take any responsibility for these operations and procedures and the Issuer urges investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: - Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream also interface with domestic securities markets in several countries. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. - Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Since Euroclear and Clearstream only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The Issuer understands that, under existing industry practices, if either the Issuer or the Trustee requests any action by owners of Book-Entry Interests or if an owner of a Book-Entry Interest desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the Indenture, Euroclear and Clearstream would authorize participants owning the relevant Book-Entry Interest to give or take such action, and such participants would authorize indirect participants to give or take such action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of such indirect participants. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants. 194 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

For purposes of this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Company” are to Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and not to any of its subsidiaries, and references to “HoldCo” are to Grupo Antolin HoldCo, S.A. The Company will issue €250.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2030 (the “Notes”) under an Indenture (the “Indenture”) to be dated, 2024, among the Company, the Guarantors, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as the trustee (in such capacity, the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (in such capacity, the “Security Agent”), paying agent and transfer agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., as registrar, in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Indenture will not incorporate or include any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended. See “Notice to Investors.” The terms of the Notes will be subject to the provisions of the Indenture. The proceeds of the offering of the Notes will be used by the Company, together with cash on balance sheet, to (i) redeem or repurchase the entire outstanding amount of the €250.0 million 3.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) issued by the Company and (ii) to pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions, in each case as set forth in this Offering Memorandum under the caption “Use of Proceeds.” The Notes will be general senior obligations of the Company and will be guaranteed (i) on the Issue Date, by the Issue Date Guarantors, all of which also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, and (ii) within 120 days from the Issue Date, by the Post-Closing Date Guarantors, all of which will also guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Senior Facilities, the 2028 Notes, the EIB Facilities and the COFIDES Facility, in each case on a senior basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the guarantee limitations described herein, in “Risk Factors—Risks related to the Notes” and in “Enforceability of Civil Liabilities and Insolvency Regime.” The Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements, and in the case of certain conflicts between the terms of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will prevail. The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative ranking of the Group’s indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of indebtedness, the procedures for undertaking enforcement action, the subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent.

We urge you to read the Indenture because it, along with the Intercreditor Agreement, and not this description, defines your rights as a holder of the notes. Copies of the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are available upon request as set forth under “Where You Can Find More Information.” The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

This summary deals only with Notes that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder (as defined below) and that are acquired upon original issuance at their “issue price” (the first price at which a substantial amount of Notes is sold to investors for cash, not including sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers). For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for United States federal income tax purposes, any of the following: - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and applicable United States Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not requested, and will not request, a ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to any of the United States federal income tax consequences described below, and as a result there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with or challenge any of the conclusions we have reached and describe herein. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes, does not address any United States federal taxes other than United States federal income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes or the Medicare tax on certain investment income) and does not deal with any non-U.S., state, local or other tax consequences that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to U.S. holders subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address: - tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, persons required to accelerate the recognition of any items of gross income with respect to the Notes as a result of such income being recognized on an applicable financial statement, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities or insurance companies; - tax consequences to persons holding the Notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or conversion transaction or a straddle; - tax consequences to U.S. holders whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar; or 195 ----- - alternative minimum tax consequences, if any. If an entity treated as a partnership (or other pass-through entity) for United States federal income tax purposes holds our Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such a partnership (or other owner in such a pass-through entity) will generally depend upon the status of the partner (or other owner) and the activities of the entity. If you are a partner of a partnership (or other owner of a pass-through entity) considering an investment in our Notes, you should consult your own tax advisors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

It is possible that our obligation to make such payments on the Notes could implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments”. If the Notes were characterized as contingent payment debt instruments, you might, among others, be required to accrue interest income at a higher rate than the stated interest rate on the Notes and to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. We intend to take the position that the likelihood of any such payments on the Notes is remote, and thus, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination that these contingencies are remote is binding on you unless you disclose your contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. Our determination, however, is not binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, you might be required to include in gross income an amount of interest in excess of stated interest and prior to the receipt of cash, and you might be required to treat income recognized on the taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. In the event a contingency occurs, it would affect the amount and timing of income recognized by you. If any contingent amounts are in fact paid, you will be required to recognize such amounts as income. The remainder of this summary assumes that our determination that the contingencies are remote is correct. The Treasury regulations applicable to contingent payment debt instruments have not been the subject of authoritative interpretation, however, and the scope of the regulations is not certain.

You may be entitled to deduct or credit any foreign tax withheld, subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of your applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest on a Note (including any additional amounts) generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the United States foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income or, in the case of certain U.S. holders, general category income. You generally will be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances. If you use the cash basis method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) the United States dollar value of the euro interest payment, determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate (as defined in United States Treasury regulations) in effect on the date such payment is received, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into United States dollars. You will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but you may have exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. If you use the accrual method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes, you may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to the euro interest payment in accordance with either of two methods. Under the 196 ----- first method, which will apply unless you elect to use the second method described below, you will be required to include in income (as ordinary income) for each taxable year the United States dollar value of the euro-denominated interest that has accrued during such year, determined by translating such interest into United States dollars at the average spot rate of exchange for the period or periods (or portions thereof) in such taxable year during which such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income into United States dollars at the spot rate on (i) the last day of the interest accrual period, or the last day of the taxable year for any portion of any accrual period ending on the last day of such taxable year; or (ii) the date the interest payment is received, if such date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period. This election will apply to all debt obligations you hold from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. You should consult your own tax advisors as to the advisability of making the above election. Upon receipt of an interest payment on a Note (including amounts received upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note attributable to accrued but unpaid interest), a U.S. holder using the accrual method will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the United States dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate in effect on the date of receipt) and the United States dollar value of the interest previously included in income with respect to such payment, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into United States dollars at such time.

Your adjusted tax basis in a Note will generally be your United States dollar cost for the Note. If you purchased your Note with euros, your United States dollar cost generally will be the United States dollar value of the euros paid for such Note determined at the spot rate at the time of purchase. If your Note is sold, exchanged, retired, redeemed or otherwise disposed of in a taxable transaction for euros, then your amount realized generally will be the United States dollar value of the euros received based on the spot rate in effect on the date of such disposition. However, if you are a cash method taxpayer and the Notes are traded on an established securities market, the amount realized generally will be the United States dollar value of such euros received based on the spot rate in effect on the settlement date of the disposition. An accrual method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the sale of Notes traded on an established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently to all debt instruments held by such U.S. holder. Such election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual method taxpayer that does not make the foregoing election will recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) if there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, any gain or loss recognized generally will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the disposition, you have held the Note for more than one year. Long-term capital gains of non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any gain or loss realized by you on the disposition of a Note would generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. A portion of any gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Any exchange gain or loss generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be treated as United States source gain or loss for United States foreign tax credit purposes. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is your purchase price for the Note calculated in euros on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the difference, if any, between (i) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date of the disposition of the Note (or, possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes) and (ii) the United States dollar value of the principal amount determined at the spot rate on the date you purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement date of purchase, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for United States federal income tax purposes). The amount of exchange gain or loss (including with respect to any accrued interest) will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Note. 197 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

In any event, the individual holder may credit the withholding against his or her final PIT liability for the relevant tax year. _Net Wealth Tax and Solidarity Tax_ According to Wealth Tax regulations (subject to any exceptions provided under relevant legislation in an Autonomous Region (Comunidad Autónoma), Spanish resident individuals whose net worth is above €700,000 on the last day of any year will be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax on their total net wealth (including the Notes) for such year at rates currently ranging from 0.2% to 3.5%.

The minimum exempt amount and the tax rates may vary among the different autonomous communities of Spain. Therefore, Spanish tax resident individuals holding the Notes should consult with their tax advisors when it comes to their specific situation. In addition to Wealth Tax, there is a temporary “solidarity tax on major fortunes” that applies to the wealth of individuals in excess of €3,000,000 (with a €700,000 general tax allowance), with rates from 1.7% to 3.5% (although the tax was initially created only for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the application of the tax has been extended indefinitely, with effect from fiscal year 2024, by virtue of Royal Decree-law 8/2023 of December 27).

In the case of Spanish resident entities, no withholding on account of CIT will be imposed on payments of interest by the Company or the Paying Agent or on income derived from the redemption, transfer or repayment of the Notes by the Company or the Paying Agent, provided that certain requirements are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the Company, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed Payment Statement).

See “—Spanish resident entities”. Ownership of the Notes by a nonresident holder will not in itself create a permanent establishment in Spain. 201 ----- _Nonresident holders not acting through a permanent establishment in Spain_ Both interest periodically received and income derived from the transfer or redemption of the Notes obtained by nonresident holders which do not act, with respect to the Notes, through a permanent establishment in Spain, are exempt from NRIT and therefore no withholding on account of NRIT will be levied on such income provided certain requirements are met (including that the Paying Agent provides the Company, in a timely manner, with a duly executed and completed Payment Statement). See “—Compliance with certain requirements in connection with income payments”. If the Paying Agent for any reason fails to deliver a duly executed and completed Payment Statement to the Company in a timely manner in respect of a payment of income under the Notes, the Company will withhold Spanish withholding tax at the then-applicable rate (currently 19%) on such payment. In this case nonresident holders are entitled to a refund of the amount withheld, with no need for any action on their part, if the Paying Agent provides the Company with a duly executed and completed Payment Statement no later than the 10[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant payment date. In addition, following the 20[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant payment date, the nonresident holder may apply to the Spanish tax authorities for any refund to which it may be entitled. The application may be filed within four years following the last day on which the Company may pay any amount so withheld to the Spanish Treasury (which is generally the 20[th] calendar day of the month immediately following the relevant payment date), by filing with the Spanish tax authorities (i) the relevant Spanish tax form, (ii) proof of ownership and (iii) a certificate of residence issued by the tax authorities of the country of tax residence of the nonresident holder, among other documents. Nonresident holders are advised to consult their own tax advisors regarding their eligibility to claim a refund from the Spanish tax authorities and the procedures to be followed in such circumstances. _Net Wealth Tax and Solidarity Tax_ Nonresident holders who are individuals (“nonresident individuals”) are subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax, which imposes a tax on property and rights in excess of €700,000 that are located in Spain, or can be exercised within the Spanish territory, on the last day of any year (such as the Notes). Notwithstanding the above, nonresident individuals that do not obtain income from the Notes through a permanent establishment in Spain will be exempt from Spanish Net Wealth Tax regarding the holding of the Notes. Furthermore, holders of the Notes who benefit from a tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to wealth tax that provides for taxation only in the country of residence of the holder of the Notes will not be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax. If the provisions of the foregoing paragraph do not apply, nonresident individuals whose net worth related to property located, or rights that can be exercised, in Spain is above €700,000 and who hold Notes on the last day of any year would be subject to Spanish Net Wealth Tax for such year at the applicable rates—currently ranging from 0.2% to 3.5%—on the average market value of the Notes during the last quarter of such year. However, nonresident individuals may apply the rules approved by the autonomous region where the largest value of assets and rights is located. Nonresident holders which are legal entities (“nonresident entities”) are not subject to the Spanish Net Wealth Tax. In addition to Wealth Tax, there is a temporary “solidarity tax on major fortunes” that may apply to nonresident individuals whose properties and rights are located in Spain or that can be exercised within the Spanish territory and exceed €3,000,000, (with a €700,000 tax allowance) with rates from 1.7% to 3.5% (although the tax was initially created only for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the application of the tax has been extended indefinitely, with effect from fiscal year 2024, by virtue of Royal Decree-law 8/2023 of December 27). The amount payable for this tax could be reduced by the amount paid for Wealth Tax. Noteholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding how this tax may apply to their investment in the Notes. _Inheritance and Gift Tax_ Nonresident individuals who acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy will be subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax, at rates currently ranging from 7.65% to 34. However, after applying all relevant factors (such as the specific regulations imposed by each Spanish autonomous community, the amount of the preexisting assets of the taxpayer and the degree of kinship with the deceased or donor), the final effective tax rate may range from 0% (full exemption) to 87.6%. 202 ----- However, if the nonresident individual is a tax resident of a country which has entered with Spain into a treaty for the avoidance of double taxation in relation to Inheritance and Gift Tax the provisions of the relevant treaty will apply. Generally, nonresident individuals are subject to Inheritance and Gift Tax according to the rules set forth in the state legislation. However, if the deceased or the donee are not resident in Spain, they may opte to apply the applicable rules corresponding to the relevant Autonomous Communities regulations. Nonresident entities which acquire ownership or other rights over the Notes by inheritance, gift or legacy are not subject to the Spanish Inheritance and Gift Tax, but such acquisitions will be subject to NRIT, without prejudice to the provisions of any applicable tax treaty for the avoidance of double taxation on income entered into by Spain.

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. The proposed FTT had a very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt. Under the current proposals, the FTT could apply, in certain circumstances, to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the participating Member States and the scope of any such tax is uncertain. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may decide to participate and participating Member States may decide not to participate. Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation with the FTT. In Spain, the Spanish law which implements the Spanish tax on financial transactions (the “Spanish FTT”) was approved on October 7, 2020 (the “FTT Law”) and the FTT Law was published on the Spanish Official State Gazette on October 16, 2020. Spanish FTT charges a 0.2% rate on specific acquisitions of listed shares issued by Spanish companies whose market capitalization exceeds €1 billion, regardless of the jurisdiction of residence of the parties involved in the transaction.

Each Plan should consider that none of the Transaction Parties will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to any decision to invest in the Notes and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. “Transaction Party” means any of the Company, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates, other than an affiliate of an Initial Purchaser that is a named fiduciary (or a fiduciary appointed by a named fiduciary) with respect to the management of the assets of the applicable Plan and acting in accordance with an applicable prohibited transaction exemption (the applicable conditions of which are satisfied).",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

A party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and/or the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Company, a Subsidiary Guarantor or an Initial Purchaser is a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued Prohibited Transaction Class Exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers. Each of the above-noted exemptions contains conditions and limitations on its application. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plans considering acquiring and/or holdings the Notes in reliance on these or any other exemption should carefully review the exemption to ensure it is applicable. There can be no assurance that any class exemption or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes, or that if an exemption is available, it will cover all aspects of any particular transaction.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. 206 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The Initial Purchasers may make offers and sales through certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers. One or more of the Initial Purchasers may sell through affiliates or other appropriately licensed entities for sales of the Notes in jurisdictions in which they are not otherwise permitted. Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Issuer proposes to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for its own accounts. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The purchase agreement provides that the obligation of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the Notes is subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by our counsel. The Purchase Agreement provides that the Company and the Guarantors, on one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, will indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments the other may be required to make in respect thereof. In order to facilitate the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the prices of the Notes. Specifically, the Initial Purchasers may over allot in connection with this Offering, creating a short position in the Notes for their own accounts. In addition, to cover overallotments or to stabilize the prices of the Notes, the Initial Purchasers may bid for, and purchase, Notes in the open market. Finally, the Initial Purchasers may reclaim selling concessions allowed to a trustee or dealer for distributing the Notes in this offering if the Initial Purchasers repurchase previously distributed Notes in transactions to cover short positions, in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above independent market levels. The Initial Purchasers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end any of these activities at any time. No assurance can be given that active public markets or other markets will develop for the Notes or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Notes. The Company and the Guarantors have agreed or will agree, as applicable, in the Purchase Agreement, that they will not offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any of their debt securities or any debt securities of our subsidiaries similar to the Notes during the period beginning on the date of this Offering Memorandum and ending on the date that is 90 days following the closing date of this Offering without the prior written consent of the Initial Purchasers.

The Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes (1) outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S and (2) in the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

The Notes will be new securities for which there are currently no markets. An application will be made for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and to be traded on the Euro MTF.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one or more of the following: (i) a retail client (as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”)); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EC (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II); or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available any Notes to any retail investor in the United Kingdom . For the purposes of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one or more of the following: (i) a retail client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”)); (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client (as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA); or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have a lending relationship with us and routinely hedge their credit exposure consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. In addition, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may acquire the Notes for their own proprietary account. The Initial Purchasers may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representative has repurchased Notes sold by or for the account of such purchaser in stabilizing or short covering transactions. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking, financial advisory, consulting, commercial banking and other commercial dealings, including as acting as hedge counterparties with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates. In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have lending relationships with us, our principal shareholders or our affiliates including pursuant to bilateral loan facilities, multilateral and/or syndicated loan facilities, guarantee, overdraft or cash management facilities and other forms of credit lines. They have received, and expect to receive, customary fees, commissions and expense reimbursements for these transactions. Each of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders and/or agents under the Senior Facilities Agreement. One or more of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may hold 2028 Notes and receive proceeds from this Offering. 208 ----- The Initial Purchasers are only acting for the Company and the Guarantors in connection with the transaction referred to in this Offering Memorandum and no one else and will not be responsible to anyone other than the Company and the Guarantors for providing the protections offered to clients of the Initial Purchasers nor for providing advice in relation to the transaction, this document or any arrangement or other matter referred to herein. CaixaBank, S.A. is not registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC or any other U.S. regulatory authority and will only offer or sell the Notes either (i) outside the United States, or (ii) in the United States to the extent permitted by Rule 15a-6 under the Exchange Act and/or other applicable U.S. securities laws. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A. is not a broker-dealer registered with the SEC and therefore may not make sales of any securities in the United States or to U.S. persons except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations.

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about    , 2024, which will be the business day following the date hereof (such settlement being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade on the date of pricing of the Notes or the next succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternative settlement arrangement at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their advisors.

Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the Manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the Manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The controlling sole shareholder of the Company, and the directors and the executive officers of the Company and the Guarantors organized under the laws of Spain are nonresidents of the United States and a significant portion of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, in order to enforce in Spain a judgment entered in another jurisdiction, the service of process on such persons or the Company or the Guarantors organized under the laws of Spain must be made in accordance with the Law 29/2015, of July 30, on international judicial cooperation in civil matters (Ley 29/2015, de 30 de julio, de cooperación jurídica internacional en materia civil) (the “ILCC Law”) and the LEC 2000. An investor may also experience difficulty in effecting service of process on or enforcing judgments against such persons or the Company or the Guarantors organized under the laws of Spain based on civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal and state securities laws or other laws. The United States and Spain are not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments and accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability would not directly be recognized or enforceable in Spain, in accordance with and subject to Article 523 LEC 2000. In the absence of any such treaty such judgment will be recognized and enforced in Spain provided that none of the circumstances set forth in Article 46 of the ILCC concur in them: - that the judgment is contrary to Spanish public policy (“órden público”); - that the judgment has been rendered by clearly breaching the rights of defense of any of the parties and, in particular, if the judgment has been rendered by default of the defendant (“en rebeldía”) it would be deemed to breach his rights of defense if the defendant was not regularly and timely notified to enable him to defend himself properly; - that the subject matter in respect of which the judgment has been rendered falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Spanish courts or, in any other matters, if the foreign court jurisdiction does not have a reasonable connection with the dispute; - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with other Spanish judgments; - that the foreign judgment is incompatible with another country’s judgment which meets the requirements to be enforceable in Spain; or - that there is an ongoing proceeding between the same parties and dealing with the same subject which was opened before a Spanish court prior to the opening of the proceedings before the foreign court. According to Article 3.2 of ILCC Law, the Spanish Government may deny cooperation with other state’s authorities if there has been a reiteration refusal of cooperation or a legal prohibition of providing cooperation by such other state’s authorities provided that the Spanish Government passes a Royal Decree for these purposes. The enforcement of any judgments in Spain will be subject to the exequatur process which shall follow, among others, the following formal requirements pursuant to Article 54.4 of the ILCC Law: (a) documents in a language other than Spanish must be accompanied by a translation into Spanish (translator’s fees will be payable); (b) certain professional fees are required for the verification of the legal authority of a party litigating in Spain if needed; (c) the payment of certain court fees; and (d) the procedural acts of a party litigating in Spain shall be directed by an attorney at law and the party shall be represented by a court agent with the exception of enforcements of judgments issued in a proceeding in which such direction and representation is not needed. In addition, please note that Spanish civil proceedings rules cannot be amended by agreement of the parties and will therefore prevail notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Notes. Pursuant to Article 54 of LEC 2000, the parties to an agreement are entitled to clearly submit to one judge (juzgado) or court (tribunal) (provided that under the LEC 2000 and the Spanish Judicial Law (Ley 6/1985, de 1 de Julio, Orgánica del 216 ----- _Poder Judicial) the relevant judge or court is competent to solve the corresponding dispute); therefore such article does not_ cover the validity of nonexclusive jurisdiction clauses, at least for conflicts between different Spanish courts.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.1,ENFORCEABILITY OF CIVIL LIABILITIES AND INSOLVENCY REGIME Spain,243.1.2,Insolvency regime,"Under Spanish insolvency law, your right to receive payments of interest and principal on the Notes in case of insolvency may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The Spanish Insolvency Law governs certain out-of court restructurings or refinancings and court insolvency proceedings. This section summarizes the main aspects of Spanish insolvency law affecting corporations, and not individuals, as there are certain specialties for the insolvency of the latest. _Concept and petition for insolvency_ In Spain, insolvency proceedings are only triggered in the event of a debtor’s current insolvency (insolvencia actual) or imminent insolvency (insolvencia inminente). Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, a debtor is insolvent when it becomes unable to regularly meet its obligations as they become due and payable (current insolvency) or when it expects that it will be unable to do so within the next three months (imminent insolvency). A petition for current insolvency may be initiated by the debtor (voluntary insolvency), by any creditor (provided that it has not acquired the credit within the six months prior to the filing of the petition for insolvency, for inter vivos acts, on a singular basis and once the credit was mature) or by certain other interested third parties (mandatory insolvency). Notwithstanding, only the debtor may file a petition for insolvency on the basis of its imminent insolvency. _Voluntary insolvency_ Insolvency is considered voluntary (concurso voluntario) if filed by the debtor. The debtor is obliged to file a petition for insolvency within two months after it becomes aware, or should have become aware, of its state of insolvency. It is presumed that the debtor becomes aware of its current insolvency, unless otherwise proved, if any of the circumstances that qualify as the basis for a petition for mandatory insolvency occur. Failure to file a petition for insolvency within the statutory two-month period may lead to personal liability of the directors for the unpaid claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the general duty to file for insolvency within the referred two months does not apply if the debtor notifies the applicable court that it has initiated or has the intention to initiate negotiations with its creditors to reach an out-of-court restructuring plan in accordance with the Spanish Insolvency Law (the “Opening of Negotiations",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.2,Communication”).,243.2.1,,"Effectively, by means of the Opening of Negotiations Communication of Articles 585 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law, in addition to those two months, the debtor gains an additional three-month period to achieve a restructuring plan with its creditors and one further month to file for the declaration of insolvency unless it is not insolvent at such time. During such period of time, creditors’ applications for insolvency will not be accepted and enforcement over assets which are necessary for the continuity of the debtor’s business activities will be prevented or suspended (secured creditors can formally commence enforcement actions, but enforcement actions will be stayed thereafter). Such three-month grace period could be extended if, not later than at the end of the initial three-month grace period, either the debtor, or creditors holding more than 50% of the debts that the restructuring plan may affect at that time (net of any credits that would qualify as subordinated claims in an insolvency situation), may request the court for a three-month extension, provided that the restructuring expert, if appointed, issues a favorable report in support of such request. _Mandatory insolvency_ Insolvency is considered mandatory (concurso necesario) if filed by a third-party creditor. Creditors may file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor but must provide evidence of its actual (not only imminent) insolvency. To this end, creditors must prove to the court that (i) there is a generalized default on payments by the 217 ----- debtor; (ii) there is a seizure of assets affecting or comprising the generality of the debtor's assets; (iii) there is a misplacement, “fire sale” or sale or ruinous liquidation of the debtor's assets; or (iv) there is a generalized default on certain tax, social security and employment obligations during the applicable statutory period (i.e., three months). Upon receipt of an insolvency petition by a creditor, the court may issue provisional interim measures to protect the assets of a debtor and may request a guarantee from the petitioning creditor asking for the adoption of such measures to cover damages caused by the preliminary protective measures. However, creditors that acquired debt six months prior to the filing of the petition for insolvency by means of inter vivos acts and by a singular title after it became due and payable, may not file for the declaration of insolvency of the debtor. _Request of joint insolvency_ The insolvency of a company forming part of a group of companies, including the parent company, does not automatically lead to the insolvency of the remaining companies of the group, however, creditors may apply for a joint insolvency declaration of two or more of its debtors which are considered legal entities if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same group of companies. Therefore, the request for the joint insolvency of two or more legal entities may only be filed by a common creditor of the relevant companies and each of the affected companies must in fact be separately insolvent. Joint insolvency may also be requested by the companies themselves provided that they form part of the same group. Any of the debtors, or the insolvency administrator, as the case may be, may apply for the procedural consolidation of insolvency proceedings already declared under certain circumstances (and, in particular, if the debtors form part of the same group of companies). In addition, creditors may apply for the procedural consolidation of the insolvency proceedings of two or more of its debtors already declared if either (a) there is a confusion of assets among them, or (b) they form part of the same group of companies, _provided that a petition has not been submitted by any of the insolvent debtors or by the insolvency administrator. Insolvency proceedings declared jointly or accumulated will be processed in coordination, without consolidation of the estate of the insolvent debtors. As a result, and as a general rule, a “group insolvency” does not lead to a commingling of the debtors’ assets and creditors of such group. This means that the creditors of one company of the group will not have recourse against other companies of the same group (except where cross-guarantees exist, in which case such a claim might be subordinated). _Conclusion of insolvency: proposal of agreement or liquidation or payment of the total debt_ The Spanish Insolvency Law provides that insolvency proceedings conclude following either the implementation of an agreement between the creditors and the debtor (“composition agreement”) or the liquidation of the debtor or payment of the total debtor’s creditors. _Enforcement and termination in a pre-insolvency scenario_ The obligations under the Notes, the Note Guarantees and the security interest might not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance. Such enforcement is subject to, _inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings, the provisions of the LEC 2000 regarding remedies and enforcement measures available under Spanish law, the provisions of the Spanish Insolvency Law and other principles of law of general application. Among others: (i) Spanish law does not expressly recognize the concept of an indemnity. Section 1,152 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil) establishes that any penalty (cláusula penal) agreed by the parties in an agreement will substitute damages (indemnización de daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach, unless otherwise agreed. Spanish courts may modify the penalty agreed on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed its obligations, unless the penalty (liquidated damages) was aimed at such partial performance. Spanish law does not foresee punitive or exemplary damages, as they may run counter to Spanish public policy (orden público). There is doubt as to the enforceability of punitive or exemplary damages in Spain; (ii) where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction; 218 ----- (iii) Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties. Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties; (iv) Spanish courts may prevent termination of an agreement if the basis of the breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings foreseen under the relevant agreement (such as payment obligations under financing agreements); (v) under Spanish law, acts carried out in accordance with the terms of a legal provision whenever said acts seek a result which is forbidden by or contrary to law, shall be deemed to have been executed in circumvention of law (fraude de ley) and the provisions whose application was intended to be avoided shall apply. _Certain effects of the insolvency for the debtor and on contracts On debtors_ As a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor in a voluntary insolvency scenario retains its powers to manage and dispose of its assets, but is subject to the court appointed intervention of the insolvency administrator (administración concursal) (intervention regime). In case of mandatory insolvency, as a general rule and subject to certain exceptions, the debtor no longer has power over its assets, and management's powers (including the power to dispose of assets) are conferred solely upon the insolvency administrators (suspension regimen). However, the court has the power to modify this general regime subject to the specific circumstances of the case. In addition, upon the insolvency administrator’s request, the court has the power to swap the intervention regime for a suspension regime or vice versa. Actions carried out by the debtor that breach any required supervision of the insolvency authorities may be declared null and void unless ratified by the insolvency administrators. _On contracts_ A declaration of insolvency does not affect agreements with reciprocal obligations pending on performance by either the insolvent party or the counterparty (executory contracts), which remain in full force and effect, and the obligations of the insolvent debtor will be fulfilled against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). The court can nonetheless terminate any such contracts at the request of the insolvency administrators (provided that management's powers have been solely conferred upon the insolvency administrators), or the company itself (if its powers to manage and dispose of its assets are only subject to the intervention of the insolvency administrators), when such termination is in the interest of the estate (rejection) (resolución _del contrato en interés del concurso) or at the request of the non-insolvent party if there has been a breach of such contract._ The termination of such contracts may result in the insolvent debtor having to return, and indemnify damages to its counterpart against the insolvency estate (con cargo a la masa). On the other hand, the judge may decide to cure any breach of the insolvent debtor at its request or the insolvency administrators’ request (assumption) (mantenimiento del contrato en interés del _concurso), in which case the non-insolvent party shall be entitled to seek specific performance against the insolvency estate_ (pre-deductible claim from the estate). Lastly, under Section 597 of the Spanish Insolvency Law, all clauses in contracts with mutual obligations (ipso facto clauses) that entitle any party to modify the obligations or suspend or terminate an agreement based solely on the other party's declaration of insolvency or by the opening of the liquidation phase of the assets (masa activa) are deemed as not included in the agreement (void) and, therefore, unenforceable, except if expressly permitted by specific laws (i.e., agency laws). In the event that the debtor, the insolvency administrators and the counterparty agree on the termination of the agreement and its effects, the insolvency court will agree such termination with the effects agreed between the affected parties; in the event of lack of agreement between them, if the insolvency court agrees the termination it will also decide the indemnifications to be received by the non-breaching party due to the termination of the agreement, which will be considered an insolvency claim (crédito concursal) or a post petition claim (crédito contra la masa) depending on the moment of the debtor’s breach (if prior the insolvency order, it would give rise to the a insolvency claim, if subsequent to the insolvency order, it would give rise to a post petition claim). Additionally, the declaration of insolvency determines that interest accrual is suspended, except (i) credit rights secured with an in rem right, in which case non-default interest accrues up to the value of the security, and (ii) any wage credits in favor of employees, which will accrue the legal interest set forth in the corresponding State Budget Act (Ley de Presupuestos _del Estado)._ 219 ----- _On enforcement proceedings_ As a general rule, the enforcement rights of unsecured creditors are suspended upon the declaration of insolvency. The enforcement of any security over certain assets or rights that are necessary for the continuation of the commercial or professional activity of the insolvent company (in rem securities)may not be commenced (and the procedures already initiated before the declaration opening insolvency proceedings shall be suspended) until the earlier of: (i) an arrangement of a composition agreement being reached, provided that the composition agreement does not affect such right; or (ii) one year having elapsed as of the declaration of the insolvency without the opening of the liquidation phase. Enforcement will be suspended even if at the time of declaration of insolvency the notices announcing the public auction have been published. The stay will only be lifted when the court hearing the insolvency proceedings determines that the asset or rights is not considered necessary for the debtor to continue its professional or business activities. When it comes to determining which assets or rights of the debtor are used for its professional or business activities, courts have generally embraced a broad interpretation and will likely include most of the debtor’s assets and rights. Finally, enforcement of the security will be generally subject to the provisions of the LEC 2000 and Spanish Insolvency Law (where applicable) and this may entail delays in the enforcement. _Ranking of credits_ Creditors are required to report their claims to the insolvency administrators within one month from the day following the last official publication of the court order declaring the insolvency, providing documentation to justify such claims. Based on the documentation provided by the creditors and documentation held by the debtor, the insolvency administrators draw up a list of acknowledged creditors/ claims and classify them according to the categories established in the Spanish Insolvency Law. Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, claims are classified in two groups: - Estate Claims (créditos contra _la masa):_ The so-called “estate claims,” are pre-deductible claims from the estate (excluding those assets of the debtor subject to _in rem security). Debt against the_ insolvency estate includes, among others, (i) certain amounts of the employee payroll, (ii) certain costs and expenses of the insolvency proceedings, (iii) certain amounts arising from services provided by the debtor under reciprocal contracts and outstanding obligations that remain in force after the insolvency of the debtor is declared (including the amounts payable as a consequence of the breach of contract by the insolvent debtor if such breach takes place after the declaration of its insolvency), (iv) those that derive from the exercise of a claw-back action within the insolvency proceedings of acts performed by the debtor and correspond to a refund of consideration received by it (except in cases of bad faith), (v) certain amounts arising from obligations created by law or from the noncontractual liability of the insolvent debtor after the declaration of insolvency and until its conclusion (or from the non-contractual liability before the declaration of insolvency due to death or personal damages), (vi) in case of liquidation, the credits granted to the bankrupt before the opening of the liquidation phase, to finance compliance with the viability plan (plan de viabilidad) to support the composition agreement, including claims granted by “specially related parties” to the debtor if the maximum claims and the details of the relevant creditor are included in the composition agreement, and (vii) in case of subsequent insolvency, 50% of the amount of credits arising from internal financing or new financing granted within the framework of a court-sanctioned restructuring plan, provided that such plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is provided by specially related parties, after deducting their claims). These claims are preferred to all others except for specially privileged claims specifically with regard to the assets (collateral) subject to the relevant security interest or special privilege. Estate claims are not subject to ranking and, in principle, must be paid as and when they fall due. - Insolvency Claims (créditos concursales). Insolvency claims are classified as follows: – Specially Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio especial): Creditors benefiting from special privileges, representing security over certain assets (in rem securities) up to the amount of the value of their security (in this regard, the value of a security shall be 90% of the reasonable value of the secured asset minus those claims that hold higher ranking security over such asset). The part of the claim exceeding the value of their security will be classified according to the nature of the claim. These claims benefiting from special privileges may entail separate enforcement proceedings, though subject to certain restrictions derived from 220 ----- a waiting period that may last up to one year and certain additional limitations set forth in the Spanish Insolvency Law. As a general rule, privileged creditors are not subject to the composition agreement unless they give their express support by voluntarily acceding to the composition agreement and if certain majorities have been reached among privileged creditors (see “—Conclusion of insolvency—Settlement”). In the event of liquidation, they are the first to collect payment against the assets on which they are secured up to the value of the security. However, the administrator has the option to halt any enforcement of the securities and pay these claims as administrative expenses under specific payment rules. – Generally Privileged Claims (créditos con privilegio general): Creditors benefiting from a general privilege, including, among others, specific labor claims and specific claims brought by public entities or authorities are recognized for half their amount, and claims held by the creditor taking the initiative to apply for the insolvency proceedings, for up to 50% of the amount of such debt (except if they rank as subordinated claims). New funds under a court-sanctioned restructuring plan in the amount not admitted as a debt against the insolvency estate (crédito contra la masa) are also credits with general privileges provided that such plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is provided by specially related parties, after deducting their claims). As a general rule and except as set forth below (see “—Conclusion of insolvency—Settlement”), the holders of general privileges will be affected by the composition agreement only if they have been authors of the proposal or if they have adhered to it, unless they have revoked the adhesion, as well as if they adhere to the agreement in a form already accepted by the creditors or approved by the judge before the judicial declaration of compliance. – Ordinary Claims (créditos ordinarios) Ordinary creditors (non-subordinated and non-privileged claims) are paid pro rata once estate claims and privileged claims have been paid. – Subordinated Claims (créditos subordinados): Subordinated claims are classified contractually or pursuant to law. Debts subordinated by virtue of law include, among others, those credits held by parties in special relationships with the debtor. In the case of a legal entity, this includes directors (whether duly appointed or “de facto” acting as such —administradores de hecho) and those holding general powers of attorney (including those that have held such positions during the two years prior to the insolvency declaration), group companies pertaining and their common shareholders, and any shareholders holding over 5% (for listed companies) or 10% (for non-listed companies) of the entity’s share capital. Notwithstanding the above, creditors who have directly or indirectly capitalized their credit rights or were appointed as directors pursuant to a restructuring plan entered into in compliance with the Spanish Insolvency Law shall not be considered as being in a special relationship with the debtor, in respect of credits against the debtor, as a result of the financing granted under such restructuring plan. Furthermore, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, assignees or awardees of claims belonging to any of the persons mentioned in this paragraph are presumed to be persons specially related to the insolvent debtor as long as the acquisition has taken place within two years prior to the insolvency proceedings being declared open. Claims related to accrued and unpaid interest, unless and to the extent they are secured by an in rem right, are also subordinated. Subordinated creditors are second-level creditors; they are not entitled to accede to the composition agreement and in the event of liquidation collect payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Law (once ordinary creditors have been paid in full). Subordinated creditors have limited chances of collecting payment according to the ranking established in the Spanish Insolvency Law. As a general rule, insolvency proceedings are not compatible with other enforcement proceedings and, therefore, such proceedings can have an effect on the estate (excluding enforcement proceedings with regard to financial collateral (as defined in Royal Decree Law 5/2005, of March 11, 2005)). When compatible, in order to protect the interests of the debtor and creditors, the Spanish Insolvency Law extends the jurisdiction of the court dealing with insolvency proceedings, which is then legally authorized to handle any enforcement proceedings or interim measures affecting the debtor’s assets (whether based upon civil, labor, or administrative law). 221 ----- _Hardening periods_ There is no claw-back date by operation of law. Therefore, there are no prior transactions that automatically become void as a result of the initiation of insolvency proceedings, but instead the insolvency administrators must expressly challenge those transactions that are considered detrimental to the insolvency estate. Under the Spanish Insolvency Law, upon the declaration of insolvency, only transactions that could be deemed as having damaged (perjudiciales) the debtor’s estate (i.e., causing a so-called “patrimonial damage”) carried out during the two years prior to the date of filing for the insolvency proceedings (and between the petition date and the opening of the insolvency proceedings), may be challenged, even if there was no fraudulent intention. Transactions taking place earlier may be rescinded subject to ordinary Spanish Civil Code based actions. Detrimental transactions carried out by the debtor two years before it files notice of negotiations with creditors can also be set aside together with those transactions carried out from that date until the opening of insolvency proceedings, provided that the court has not approved a restructuring plan and opens insolvency proceedings for the debtor in the year after the pre-bankruptcy protection is no longer in effect. The Spanish Insolvency Law does not define the meaning of “patrimonial damage.” Damage does not refer to the intention of the parties, but to the consequences of the transaction on the debtor’s interest resulting in the damage to the debtor’s estate or the prejudice to the equality of the treatment among creditors which drives insolvency proceedings (pars condition _creditorum). There are several “irrebuttable presumptions” expressly set forth by the Spanish Insolvency Law (i.e., free_ disposals and prepayment or cancellation of the company’s claims or obligations prior to them being due and where the due dates of the relevant claims or payment obligations fall after the date of declaration of insolvency, except if such obligations were secured by an in rem security, in which case such transactions are subject to a rebuttable presumption of “patrimonial damage” as set forth below). In addition to the above, the Spanish Insolvency Law sets forth certain actions which are deemed to cause a “patrimonial damage” to the debtor, but which are “rebuttable presumptions” and therefore subject to being contested by the other party (i.e., disposals in favor of “specially related parties” (personas especialmente relacionadas) the provision of security in respect of previously existing obligations or in respect of new obligations replacing existing ones and the payment or other acts to terminate obligations being secured by an in rem security and which mature after the declaration of insolvency). Ordinary transactions carried out within the debtor’s ordinary course of business cannot be rescinded, provided that they are carried out at arm’s length. In any event, fraudulent acts that have been entered into by creditors may always be rescinded and also those payments made by the debtor in respect of obligations which the debtor, at the time of payment, could not be compelled to pay. The consequence of the court resolution rescinding a prejudicial act is that the parties involved are required to return their reciprocal consideration with any accrued rents or interest. As explained below, interim financing and new financing granted by new or pre-existing lenders in the framework of a court-sanctioned restructuring plan and actions and transactions considered reasonable and necessary for the successful negotiation and implementation of the plan will be protected against insolvency claw-back actions, provided that the plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60%, after deducting their claims, where finance has been provided by specially related parties). _Conclusion of insolvency Settlement_ Once the debtor’s assets and liabilities have been identified, the Spanish Insolvency Law encourages creditors to reach an agreement regarding payment of the insolvency debts. This agreement may be proposed either by the debtor or by the creditors, and it shall set forth how, when and up to what amount creditors are to be paid. Once executed, this agreement must be honored by the debtor and respected by the creditors. The settlement or composition agreement should contain proposals for write-offs and/or stays for a period shorter than 10 years according to Article 317 of the Spanish Insolvency Law and it may also contain alternative or complementary proposals for all creditors or for certain classes of creditors (except for public entities), including conversion of debt into shares, into profit-sharing credits convertible bonds or subordinated debt, or any financial instrument different from the original debt. It may also include proposals for allocation of all assets or of certain assets to a specific person with a commitment from the acquirer to continue the activity and to pay off the debt as determined in the settlement agreement. 222 ----- The proposals in the settlement shall include a payment schedule. In order for a settlement or composition agreement to be deemed approved by the creditors, the following majorities shall be met: (i) In case the composition agreement contains write-offs equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims; to stay on the payment of principal, interest or any other outstanding amount for a period not exceeding five years; more than 50% of the ordinary claims must accede to such settlement or composition agreement. Notwithstanding the above, a simple majority will suffice when the composition agreement consists of (i) full payment of ordinary or unsecured claims within a period not exceeding three years or (ii) immediate repayment of outstanding ordinary claims applying a write off of less than 20%. (ii) If the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, it will be required that at least the 65% of the ordinary creditors must accede to the composition agreement. The holders of subordinated credits and those creditors considered as especially related to the debtor are not entitled to accede to the composition agreement. Although in principle secured and privileged creditors are not subject to an approved composition agreement (unless they have expressly voted in its favor or adhered thereto) the effects of an approved composition agreement can be extended to secured and privileged creditors provided that the relevant composition agreement of creditors has been approved by the majorities of creditors within its category of creditors (labor creditors, public law creditors, financial creditors or others): (i) if the composition agreement contains the full payment of ordinary claims within a period not exceeding three years or the immediate payment of outstanding claims applying a write off of less than 20%, a write-off (or debt discharges) equal to or less than 50% of the amount of the claims, stays for a period no longer than five years or conversion of debt into profit participating loans, also for a period no longer than five years, at least 60% of privileged creditors have acceded to the composition agreement; and (ii) in case the composition agreement contains an alternative different from the above, 75% of privileged creditors must accede to the composition agreement. _Cramdown effects of certain refinancing agreements_ If a debtor and certain of its creditors enter into a restructuring plan meeting the requirements of the Spanish Insolvency Law and it is therefore sanctioned by the court, the plan can be imposed on dissenting creditors (or classes of creditors) and shareholders. The debtor must be currently or imminently insolvent or in a situation of likelihood of insolvency (probabilidad de insolvencia) (i.e., where the debtor foresees that it may be unable to meet its obligations as they fall due over the next following two years in the absence of the implementation of a restructuring plan). Restructuring plans are defined very broadly. They may alter the structure or terms of the debtor’s assets, liabilities or equity and may also include transfers of assets, business units or the whole company, as well as measures of operational reorganization. In addition, any claim may be affected by the plan (not only financial claims), except for maintenance claims (créditos de alimentos), those arising in tort and claims by employees other than senior management. Affected creditors must be placed in classes and the Spanish Insolvency Law contains the distinction between plans that are approved by all classes (the so-called consensual plans) and those that are not (known as non-consensual plans or cross-class cram down). It is also possible to impose a restructuring plan on shareholders where measures would otherwise need to be approved by a general meeting and the shareholders have voted against them (or the general meeting does not take place), but only where the debtor is in a situation of ‘current’ or ‘imminent’ insolvency, not a ‘likelihood of insolvency.’ Spanish Insolvency Law states that classes must be based on the shared interest of each of the creditors. As a general rule, claims with different rankings will be placed into separate classes. In addition, claims that rank pari passu may be split into different classes where, for example, possible conflicts of interest arise, 223 ----- claims are of a financial or other nature, specific claims may be affected differently by the plan or, in the case of secured claims, the different nature or type of the secured assets. Required majorities for the approval of a restructuring plan: (a) Consensual plans (approved by all classes of creditors and by shareholders) will be considered approved if, within each class, they are voted for by more than 2/3 of creditors by value of the debt (or 3/4 of the debt in classes formed by secured creditors). There are special rules for syndicated claims so as to allow the syndicate to be taken fully into account, provided the above majorities, as applicable, vote in favor (or the contractual majorities, if lower). (b) Non-consensual plans (not approved by all classes of creditors or by shareholders) must be approved either by a simple majority of classes (including at least one class comprised of preferential or secured creditors) or by at least one class that is considered to be ‘in the money.’ A class of creditors can be presumed to be “in the money” if, further to the valuation of the business as a going concern by the restructuring expert, it is considered that such class would have received payment. As an exception to the above, even where the plan has been sanctioned by a court, if dissenting creditors hold security and belong to a class in which fewer creditors voted for the plan than against, such creditors may enforce their security within one month following the publication of the order sanctioning the plan. The plan may allow creditors to accept a cash payment for the portion of the claim covered by the value of the security within 120 days, in lieu of enforcing their security. Dissenting creditors affected due to a cram-down will preserve their rights against those who granted personal guarantees or security. As an exception, restructuring plans for one company in a group may be extended to security or guarantees from other group companies not a party to the plan, if it is argued that enforcement/payment of guarantees could cause both the guarantor and debtor to become insolvent. Other effects of court-sanctioned restructuring plans are: (a) interim financing and new financing granted by new or pre-existing lenders in the framework of a courtsanctioned restructuring plan and actions and transactions considered reasonable and necessary for the successful negotiation of the plan and for the implementation of the same will be protected from potential insolvency claw-back actions, provided that the plan affects claims that represent at least 51% of the total liabilities (or more than 60% where finance is provided by specially related parties, after deducting their claims); (b) interim financing and new financing granted by new or pre-existing lenders in the framework of a courtsanctioned restructuring plan will be classified in possible insolvency proceedings as estate claims (créditos _contra la masa) (as to 50% of the claim) and as generally privileged claims (créditos con privilegio general)_ (the remaining 50%), provided that the plan affects the same claims as described in paragraph (a) above; and (c) possibility of terminating agreements with outstanding reciprocal obligations, senior management contracts and swap agreements in the interest of the restructuring. _Liquidation_ Liquidation is conceived as an outcome subsidiary to settlement. It operates when a composition agreement is not reached, it is breached or when it is decided upon by the insolvency court. The insolvent company is entitled to request the liquidation at any time and, in any event, it must file a petition for liquidation if, during the period while the settlement is in force, it becomes aware of no longer being able to meet the payment commitments and obligations undertaken after the approval of such settlement. In such a case, the company will be aimed at dissolution and the directors and liquidators will be removed. Deferred credits will compulsorily fall due and credits consisting of other benefits are converted into cash credits. The Spanish Insolvency Law contains certain general rules of liquidation to be followed by the insolvency administrator, which can be modified or replaced by the judge on a case-by-case basis, subject to a hearing of or report from 224 ----- the insolvency administrator (special rules). The insolvency administration is required to report quarterly on the liquidation and has one year to complete it. If the liquidation is not completed within one year, the court may appoint a different insolvency administration pursuant to Article 427 et seq. of the Spanish Insolvency Law. _Fraudulent Conveyance Laws_ Under Spanish law, in addition to the insolvency claw-back action, the insolvency administrator and any creditor may bring an action to rescind a contract or agreement (acción rescisoria pauliana) against the debtor and the third party which is a party to such contract or agreement, provided that the same is performed or entered into fraudulently and the creditor cannot obtain payment of the amounts owed in any other way. Although case law is not entirely consistent, it is broadly accepted that the following requirements must be met in order for a creditor to bring such action: - the debtor owes the creditor an amount under a valid contract and the fraudulent action took place after such debt was created; - the debtor has carried out an act that is detrimental to the creditor and beneficial to the third party; - such act was fraudulent; - there is no other legal remedy available to the creditor to obtain compensation for the damages suffered; and - debtor’s insolvency, construed as the situation where there has been a relevant decrease in the debtor’s estate making it impossible or more difficult to collect the claim. The existence of fraud (which must be evidenced by the creditor) is one of the essential requirements under Spanish law for the action to rescind to succeed. Pursuant to Article 1,297 of the Spanish Civil Code (Código Civil): (i) agreements by virtue of which the debtor transfers assets for no consideration, and (ii) transfers for consideration carried out by parties who have been held liable by a court (sentencia condenatoria) or whose assets have been subject to a writ of attachment (mandamiento de embargo) will be considered fraudulent. The presumption referred to in (i) above is a _iuris et de iure presumption (i.e., it cannot be rebutted by evidence), unlike the presumption indicated in (ii) above, which is a iuris tantum presumption (i.e., it is a rebuttable presumption). If the rescission action were to be upheld, the third party would be liable to return to the debtor the consideration received under the contract in order to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor. Following that, the creditor would need to carry out the actions necessary to obtain the amount owed by the debtor. If the consideration received by the third party under the contract cannot be returned to the debtor, the third party must indemnify the creditor for such damages. _Set-off_ The Spanish Insolvency Law generally prohibits set off of the credits and debts of the insolvent company once it has been declared insolvent, but the set off of credits and debts required in order to operate that were agreed before the declaration of insolvency can still apply. However, set-off may be exercised by a determined creditor vis-à-vis the insolvent company if the governing law of the reciprocal credit right of the insolvent company permits it under its insolvency scenarios, or where the debts and credits of the insolvent party arise from the same legal relationship.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Enforcement of guarantees may cause the amount of the relevant guarantor’s net equity (patrimonio neto) to fall below half of its share capital and, in such case, the guarantor will need to be wound up (disolverse), unless its share capital is increased or decreased in the required amount to reestablish the balance between its net equity and its share capital, and provided that it is not required to declare its insolvency.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

These judgments acknowledge the validity of provisions pursuant to which guarantors waive the ability to call on enforceability exceptions different to those arising from the guarantee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain case law has also admitted the possibility that, with certain limitations, the guarantor automatically raises the enforceability exception of fraud, bad faith or abuse of right (abuso de derecho) where the beneficiary enforces the guarantee in a fraudulent manner or in bad faith.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Such guarantee/security interests cannot be held by a third party which does not hold the guaranteed/secured claim but purports to hold guarantees/security interests for the parties that do. In any proceedings directly brought within the Spanish jurisdiction against any Spanish guarantor, the concept of “parallel debt” is likely to be questioned by Spanish courts; the issuer is not aware of any court precedent where a parallel debt constructions has been considered. In any proceedings directly brought within the Spanish jurisdiction against any Spanish Guarantor or any Spanish security provider, the concept of “parallel debt” is likely to be questioned by Spanish courts, although there is no precedent where a parallel debt construction has been considered.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The absence of such a reasonable and justified corporate benefit and interest may constitute grounds to challenge such acts and transactions. When assessing whether or not directors have acted in the best interest of a Spanish company, only the interest of such Spanish company are taken into account. Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the group are not always considered consistent with the best interest of a Spanish company. In the context of upstream and cross-stream guarantees, the Spanish Supreme Court has ruled that the subsidiary granting the guarantee or security interest to secure the debt of its parent company or other companies of its group, should receive some kind of consideration or benefit, either directly or indirectly, to compensate the financial burden assumed in the interest of the group. This compensation (i) must be verifiable, even if it is not 228 ----- received simultaneously to the delivery of the guarantee or security; (ii) must be adequate and proportional to the burden assumed by the relevant company in the interest of its group; and (iii) must have an economic value. Furthermore, the action or transaction undertaken in the interest of the group must be justified and must not put the solvency of the subsidiary into jeopardy. Accordingly, transactions undertaken for the benefit of the group may not always be considered consistent with the best interest and corporate benefit of a Spanish company. 229 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,243,WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION,243.3,Limitations on Validity and Enforcement of the notes and the guarantees and collateral under Spanish law,243.3.5,,"In case of any claims brought against the issuer and the Spanish guarantors before Spanish courts, the obligations of the issuer and the guarantors under the notes and the guarantees might not necessarily be enforced in accordance with their respective terms in every circumstance, such enforcement being subject to, inter alia, the nature of the remedies available in the Spanish courts, the acceptance by such court of jurisdiction, the discretion of the courts, the power of such courts to stay proceedings and the availability of defenses. In this regard: - Spanish law does not possess the concept of “indemnity” in contracts, and the specific reception of this common law notion in the Spanish legal system is still subject to a degree of uncertainty. Spanish law recognizes explicitly liquidated damages provisions, as well as penalty provisions (both dimensions fall within the Spanish term _cláusula penal). Article 1152 of the Spanish Civil Code establishes that a cláusula penal agreed by the parties,_ unless otherwise determined by the agreement, will be deemed as a substitute for damages (indemnización de 225 ----- _daños) and the payment of interest (abono de intereses) in an event of breach. Spanish courts may modify an_ agreed cláusula penal on an equitable basis if the debtor has partially or irregularly performed the obligations for whose complete breach the cláusula penal was foreseen in the contract. Other grounds for the modification of a _cláusula penal are possible but exceptional._ - Spanish law does not know punitive or exemplary damages, in contract or in tort. On non-contractual grounds, the excessive nature of the punitive or exemplary damages may run counter to Spanish public policy (orden _público). In contract, there is doubt as to the enforceability in Spain of punitive or exemplary damages._ - Where obligations are to be performed in a jurisdiction outside Spain, they may not be enforceable in Spain to the extent that performance would be illegal under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction. In general, a Spanish court will take into consideration the overriding mandatory provisions of the jurisdiction where the obligations arising out of the contract have to be or have been performed, in so far as those provisions render the performance of the contract unlawful. In considering whether to give effect to those foreign provisions, the court will consider their nature and purpose and the consequences of their application or non-application. - A Spanish court will apply the overriding mandatory provisions of the laws of Spain. A Spanish court may refuse the application of a provision of a foreign law applicable to the contract if the content of such provision is manifestly incompatible with the public policy (orden público) of Spain. - Spanish law precludes the validity and performance of contractual obligations to be left at the discretion of one of the contracting parties (Article 1256 of the Spanish Civil Code). Therefore, Spanish courts may refuse to uphold and enforce terms and conditions of an agreement giving ample discretionary authority to one of the contracting parties to make binding determinations affecting the other party. - Spanish law, as construed by the Spanish Supreme Court, sets limits based on good faith to the exercise by one party of the right to terminate an agreement granted by a provision therein, on the basis of a breach of obligations, undertakings or covenants which are merely ancillary or complementary to the main undertakings (such as payment obligations under financing agreements), foreseen under the relevant agreement. - A Spanish court may not accept acceleration (vencimiento anticipado) of an agreement if the default underlying the decision to accelerate were only of minimal or trivial importance. Acceleration, in principle, is to be associated with a material default. The decision to accelerate an agreement must be based on objective facts and cannot be left to the sole discretion of one party as this would infringe Article 1256 of the Spanish Civil Code. It may not be disregarded that the enforcement of a guarantee or collateral granted by a Spanish guarantor could require a judgment to be previously rendered in New York declaring the default or acceleration of the secured obligations and the amount due and payable thereunder. - Reasonability and justification of risk associated with a guarantee or a security interest. The interpretations of the laws of Spain by the courts may limit the ability of Spanish Guarantors to guarantee the Notes. Although the law does not establish any limit, certain case law indicates (and certain scholars understand) that risks associated with a guarantee or a security interest provided by a company to secure the indebtedness held by other companies within its corporate group shall be reasonable and economically and operationally justified from the guarantor’s own perspective and justified under the corporate interest of such guarantor and all this must be evidenced to the judge. - Under Spanish law, claims may become time barred (five years since the obligation becomes enforceable being the general term established for obligations in personam) or may be or become subject to the defense of set off or counterclaim. In addition, an extension of maturity granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee. - To this effect, Article 1851 of the Spanish Civil Code (a provision whose application may be excluded by agreement of the guarantor and the creditor) establishes that an extension granted to a debtor by a creditor without the consent of the guarantor extinguishes the guarantee. The application of this provision is particularly likely when the extension granted may have some potential negative effect to the recovery rights of the guarantor vis-àvis the debtor. - In general terms, under Spanish law, any guarantee must guarantee a primary obligation to which it is ancillary. The primary obligation must be clearly identified in the guarantee agreement, and a guarantee such as the 226 ----- guarantees granted by the Spanish guarantors will be null and void if the obligations it secures are declared null and void and may be affected by any amendment, supplement, waiver, repayment, novation or extinction of the issuer’s obligations under the notes The enforcement of guarantees may be limited since the guarantor may not be required to pay any amount in excess of the amount owed by the principal debtor or under conditions that are less favorable than those applying to the principal debtor. - The terms “enforceable,” “enforceability,” “valid,” “legal,” “binding” and “effective” (or any combination thereof) mean that all the obligations assumed by the relevant party under the relevant documents are of a type enforced by Spanish courts; the terms do not mean that these obligations will necessarily be enforced in all circumstances in accordance with their terms. In particular, enforcement before the courts will in any event be subject to: (a) the nature of the remedies available in the courts; (b) damages may be awarded if the specific performance of an obligation is deemed impracticable; (c) Spanish public policy (orden público); (d) the availability of defenses such as (without limitation), set-off (unless validly waived), indirect infringement or circumvention of a mandatory legal rule (fraude de ley), abuse in the exercise of rights (abuso de derecho), misrepresentation, force majeure, extraordinary unforeseen circumstances, undue influence (and under some laws in Spain other than the common laws of Spain, unfair advantage), fraud, duress, abatement and counter-claim; and (e) potential modifications by a court of the obligations deriving from the Spanish guarantees could be exceptionally imposed by Spanish courts when deemed necessary to restore the balance between the obligations of the parties to a contract in the presence of unexpected and exceptional circumstances directly affecting such balance, and such circumstances (i) were unforeseeable when the guarantees were executed, (ii) would not have been expressly or implicitly assumed in the objective risk assessment of the transaction and subjective risk assessment of the parties, and (iii) directly affect the position of the parties and entail a drastic change in the consideration or the reciprocal obligations assumed in the contract, to such an extent that strict compliance with the obligations assumed by one party turns to be nearly impracticable or extremely burdensome. - The Spanish financial assistance rules set forth in section 143.2 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act regarding Spanish private limited liability companies (sociedades limitadas) and in section 150 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act regarding Spanish public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas) provide that Spanish public limited liability companies cannot grant any type of funds, guarantees or any other financial assistance to facilitate the acquisition of their own shares or the shares of their parent companies. This prohibition is broader for private limited liability companies, which cannot provide financial assistance to facilitate the acquisition of their shares, the shares of their parent companies or the shares of other companies within their corporate group. In particular, no Spanish guarantor may secure or guarantee any payment, prepayment, repayment or reimbursement obligation derived from any finance document used, or that may be used, for the purposes of payment of acquisition debt or the refinancing of the same (for the purposes of sections 143.2, 149 or 150, as applicable, of the Spanish Capital Companies Act) or the payment of any costs or transaction expenses related to, or paying the purchase price for, such acquisition of shares. - In addition, certain defenses available to any additional Spanish guarantors may limit the amount guaranteed under the guarantees by reference to the net assets and share capital of such Spanish guarantors. Under the Spanish Capital Companies Act, Spanish companies (both public limited liability companies (sociedades anónimas) and private limited liability companies (sociedades de responsabilidad limitada), as well as sociedades comanditarias _por acciones may issue and guarantee (or provide security for) numbered series of notes and other securities that_ recognize or create debt, with certain restrictions applicable to private limited liability companies. Pursuant to section 401 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act, the issuance by private limited liability companies cannot exceed an aggregate maximum amount equal to twice its own funds (recursos propios); unless the issue is secured by a mortgage, a pledge of securities, a public guarantee or a joint guarantee from a credit institution. There is no consistent opinion among scholars and practitioners yet nor case law regarding the interpretation of Section 401 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act on whether the restriction set out therein should apply not only to the issuance of notes but also to the guarantee provided by private limited liability companies covering such notes. 227 ----- Additionally, private limited liability companies cannot issue or guarantee (or provide security for) notes convertible into quota shares (participaciones sociales). - The Spanish Capital Companies Act under its section 160f) establishes that deliberating and deciding on matters involving the “acquisition, disposal or transfer” of a company’s essential assets falls within the scope of the general shareholders’ meeting’s jurisdiction (competencia de la junta general). It is presumed that assets are considered essential when the amount of the transaction exceeds twenty-five percent of the value of the company’s assets shown in the latest approved balance sheet, although assets under that threshold may be considered essential as well. In the absence of sufficient and conclusive case law (jurisprudencia), Spanish scholars (doctrina) have not reached a consensus at the time of this issuance as to whether the creation of encumbrances or liens on essential assets of a company (such as pledges or mortgages) shall be deemed to be an act of “disposal” for the purposes of section 160 f) of the Spanish Capital Companies Act and, thus, fall within the scope of the aforementioned section, or whether it shall not be deemed to be an act of “disposal” and, thus, not fall within the scope of this section. The second interpretation would allow for the management body of a company —instead of the general shareholders’ meeting— to deliberate and decide on the creation of encumbrances or liens on essential assets of a company.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The Directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting"" as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these interim condensed consolidated financial statements based on our limited review.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,332,LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION,332.8,Scope of Review,332.8.1,,"We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410, ""Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity"". A limited review of interim financial information consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A limited review is substantially less in scope than an audit carried out in accordance with legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion on the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements. ----- #### Conclusion  Based on our limited review, which can under no circumstances be considered an audit, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024 have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS 34), “Interim Financial Reporting”, as adopted by the European Union. #### Emphasis of Matter  The Company’s Directors have prepared the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with IAS 34, “Interim Financial Reporting” as adopted by the European Union. Consequently, as specified in the accompanying note 2 a), these financial statements present condensed information and do not include all the disclosures required in complete consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union. The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements should therefore be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023. This matter does not change our conclusion. #### Other Matter  In note 2 (a) of the accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements, the Directors state the reasons for the re-issuance of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024 of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and subsidiaries. This limited review report supersedes and replaces our previous limited review report dated 25 June 2024 issued on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. and subsidiaries originally prepared by the Directors, in which we expressed an unmodified conclusion.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,332,LISTING AND GENERAL INFORMATION,332.9,Joint operations-,332.9.1,a)_** **_Basis of presentation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements-,"In accordance with Final Provision Eleven of Law 62/2003, of 30 December 2003, on Tax, Administrative and Labour and Social Security Measures, holding companies that are required to prepare consolidated financial statements and directors' reports, where, at the end of the reporting period, none of the Group companies has issued securities admitted to trading on a regulated market of any European Union member state, may opt to present their consolidated financial statements for the years beginning on or after 1 January 2005 either in accordance with Spanish accounting legislation or in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards previously adopted by the European Union. Accordingly, Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. decided to apply voluntarily, for the first time in 2007, the aforementioned International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union when preparing its consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements for 2023 were prepared by the Parent's Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (hereinafter, “IFRS-EU”),) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain, applying the basis of consolidation, accounting policies and measurement bases described in Notes 2 and 3 to those consolidated financial statements, and, accordingly, present fairly the Group's consolidated equity and consolidated financial position as at 31 December 2023 and the consolidated results of its operations, the changes in its consolidated equity and the consolidated cash flows for the year then ended. The consolidated financial statements of Antolin for 2023 were approved by the Parent's sole shareholder on 10 June 2024. On 24 June 2024 the Directors of the Parent prepared the Group’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024, presenting them in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. However, as a consequence of the divestment plan of certain business and assets executed by the Group during April 2024 and June 2024, and the agreement reached by the Group for the extension of its syndicated debt in June 2024, on 1 July 2024 the Directors of the Parent have restated the said interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024, in order to disclose in them the most significant information thereon (Note 2-i), which are presented in accordance with IAS 34, Interim Financial Reporting. These facts were not disclosed in the Group's interim condensed consolidated financial statements prepared on 24 June 2024. ----- ----- ----- ----- Extension of syndicated debt In June 2024, the Company agreed with its creditor banks to extend the maturity of its Senior Facilities Agreement until June 2029. The agreement includes more than 500 million euros in syndicated debt plus a revolving credit facility. The financial cost has been set at Euribor plus a credit spread that will vary from 250 to 400 basis points depending on the company’s financial leverage. The agreement gives Antolin’s financial structure more flexibility and strength for years to come. Divestment plan On 26 June 2024, the Company has signed an agreement to sell 45% of Ototrim Panel Sanayi ve Ticaret, A.S., (the Company held 50% of the entity, see note 1) supplier of the largest vehicle manufacturers in the Turkish market, to its partner Diniz Holding. The Company will raise 45 million euros through this transaction. The Company, which after the sale will hold 5% of entity, will continue to work with its Turkish partner going forward. This transaction is expected to generate a profit of 28 million euros in the condensed consolidated income statements of the Group, which will be recognized in the financial year 2024. In addition, on 28 June 2024 the Company has signed an agreement with Grupo Cosmos, a Spanish automotive supplier with a long and proven track record in the auto industry, to sell its trunk trim business for 31 million euros. The non-core activity sold includes the manufacturing and assembly operations focused on trunk trim in Alabama (US) and Silao (Mexico) as well as factories of Kecskemet (Hungary) and Rastatt (Germany) and a technical office in Austria, primarily focused on this activity. In total, more than 400 employees are transferred in the business sold. This transaction is expected to generate a loss of 15 million euros in the condensed consolidated income statements of the Group, which will be recognized in the financial year 2024. As of this date these two transactions are pending closure of certain regulatory issues. Additionally, on 28 June 2024, the Company has signed sale and leaseback operations at two centers in Spain and Morocco for a joint value of 17.1 million euros. On 11 April 2024, the Company completed another sale and leaseback operation at one center in Spain of 6.2 million euros. Finally, in June 2024, the Company sold a building for 0.5 million euros in France. The results in the condensed consolidated income statements of the Group generated by these transactions were not significant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

P.º de la Castellana, 259C 28046 Madrid ## Independent Auditor's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements _(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)_ To the Sole Shareholder of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. ##### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS #### Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. (the “Parent”) and subsidiaries (together the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group at 31 December 2023 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain. #### Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's _Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._ We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. We have not provided any nonaudit services, nor have any situations or circumstances arisen which, under the aforementioned regulations, have affected the required independence such that this has been compromised. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ----- #### Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. |Recoverable amount of non-current assets See notes 2e), 3a), 3b), 3c), 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2| |---|---| |Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit| |At 31 December 2023 the Group has intangible assets with a carrying amount of Euros 374,616 thousand, property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of Euros 624,429 thousand and goodwill with a carrying amount of Euros 90,836 thousand allocated to the pertinent cash-generating units. At 31 December 2023 impairment of Euros 110,589 thousand has been recognised on intangible assets and Euros 64,202 on property, plant and equipment, of which Euros 24,470 thousand and Euros 3,987 thousand, respectively, were recognised in 2023. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of goodwill annually and tests property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for indications of impairment, for the purposes of determining their recoverable amount. The Group has calculated the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for which it has identified indications of impairment by applying valuation techniques that require the exercising of judgement and the use of assumptions by management and the Directors. Due to the high level of judgement and the uncertainty associated with these assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, their measurement has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Assessing the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of estimating the recoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets. - Assessing the criteria used by the Directors and Group management when identifying indications of impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill. - Evaluating the methodology and assumptions used by management and the Directors to estimate the recoverable amount applying the discounted cash flow method at cash-generating unit level, with the involvement of our valuation specialists. - Comparing the cash flow forecasts estimated in prior years with the actual cash flows obtained. - Contrasting the information contained in the model used to calculate the recoverable amount with the Group's business plans approved by management. - Analysing the sensitivity of the estimated recoverable amount to changes in the relevant assumptions and judgements, such as the discount rate and the expected future growth rate used to estimate future cash flows. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.| ----- |Capitalisation of development expenses See notes 2e), 3b) and 7 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2| |---|---| |Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit| |In 2023 the Group capitalised development expenses amounting to Euros 106,603 thousand and at 31 December 2023 the Group has capitalised total development expenses of Euros 308,095 thousand under other intangible assets. The capitalisation of development expenses requires an analysis of compliance with the requirements laid down in the financial reporting framework. If there are reasonable doubts as to the technical success or economic-financial feasibility of the projects, the amounts recognised as assets should be taken directly to the consolidated income statement, and therefore there is a risk that the capitalised costs would not meet the criteria set forth in the financial reporting framework for their capitalisation. Due to the judgement associated with the foregoing assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, capitalisation of such costs as development expenses has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Evaluating the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of recognising development expenses and identifying, where applicable, the expenses that qualify for capitalisation. - Performing tests of detail for a sample of capitalised development expenses, corroborating the amounts capitalised and analysing the supporting documentation prepared by management and which substantiates the technical success and economic-financial feasibility of the projects, assessing the reasonableness of the main assumptions considered. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the reporting requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.| #### Other Information: Consolidated Directors’ Report Other information solely comprises the 2023 consolidated directors' report, the preparation of which is the responsibility of the Parent's Directors and which does not form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not encompass the consolidated directors' report. Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated directors’ report is defined in the legislation regulating the audit of accounts, as follows: a) Determine, solely, whether the consolidated non-financial information statement has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, and if not, to report on this matter. b) Assess and report on the consistency of the rest of the information included in the consolidated directors’ report with the consolidated financial statements, based on knowledge of the Group obtained during the audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements. Also, assess and report on whether the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated directors’ report are in accordance with applicable legislation. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report them. ----- Based on the work carried out, as described above, we have observed that the information mentioned in section a) above has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, that the rest of the information contained in the consolidated directors’ report is consistent with that disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for 2023, and that the content and presentation of the report are in accordance with applicable legislation. #### Directors' and Audit Committee's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Parent's Directors are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in such a way that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity, consolidated financial position and consolidated financial performance of the Group in accordance with IFRS-EU and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements. #### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: #### – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ----- #### – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. #### – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent's Directors. #### – Conclude on the appropriateness of the Parent's Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. #### – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view. #### – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the audit committee of the Parent regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Parent's audit committee with a statement that we have complied with the applicable ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and to communicate with them all matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated to the audit committee of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U., we determine those that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. ----- ##### REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS #### Additional Report to the Audit Committee of the Parent The opinion expressed in this report is consistent with our additional report to the audit committee of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. dated 15 April 2024. #### Contract Period We were appointed as auditor of the Group by the sole shareholder on 20 July 2021 for a period of three years, beginning the year ended 31 December 2021.

Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Following an assessment made by the Group, the only joint operation in which the Group is deemed to participate is International Door Company, B.V., a holding company with registered office in Amsterdam (Netherlands), in which the Parent has a 50% interest (the cost of this interest amounted to 2,790 thousand euros at 31 March 2024 and 31 December 2023). The other 50% is held by Küster Holding, GmbH, and the financial statements of the joint operation were proportionately consolidated. The amounts of the assets and liabilities, and of the revenue and the profit or loss for the three-month period ended 31 March 2024 contributed by this joint operation are scantly material with respect to the total consolidated figures for the Group. **(2)** **BASIS OF PRESENTATION OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

AND SUBSIDIARIES",1991.29,f)** **Consolidation standards-,1991.29.1,,"Subsidiaries Subsidiaries, including structured entities, are those over which the Parent exercises control directly, or indirectly via subsidiaries. The Parent controls a subsidiary when, through its involvement, it is exposed or has the right to variable returns by means of the power exercised over it. The Parent has this power if it has substantive rights in force which enable it to direct the relevant activities. The Parent is exposed, or has the right, to variable returns for its involvement in the subsidiary when the returns it obtains through that involvement may change based on the subsidiary’s economic performance. A structured entity is one that is designed so that voting and other similar rights are not essential when determining who controls the entity, e.g., in the event that possible voting rights refer exclusively to administrative activities and these are governed by contractual agreements. Subsidiary revenues, expenses and cash flows are included in the consolidated financial statements as of the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Group effectively obtains control over them. Subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation as of the date on which that control is lost. The transactions and balances with Group companies and unrealised profits or losses have been eliminated in the consolidation process. However, unrealised losses were considered as a sign of impairment in respect of the value of the transferred assets. The accounting policies of the subsidiaries were adapted to the Group's accounting policies for transactions and other events that are similar and occurred under similar circumstances. The individual financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the consolidation process refer to the same reporting date and period as those of the Parent. The individual financial statements of subsidiaries have been fully consolidated with those of the Parent. ----- Business combinations The Group applies the acquisition method in business combinations. The acquisition date is the one on which the Group obtains control over the business acquired. The consideration delivered for the business combination is determined on the acquisition date by the sum of the fair values of the assets delivered, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any contingent consideration dependent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions in exchange for the control over the business acquired. The consideration delivered excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the business acquired. Costs relating to the acquisition are recognised as an expense when they are incurred. On the acquisition date the Group recognises the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed (and any other noncontrolling interest) at their fair value. The non-controlling interest in the business acquired is recognised at the amount corresponding to the percentage in the fair value of the net assets acquired. This criterion solely applies to non-controlling interests that grant present access to financial profits and the right to the proportional part of the acquired entity's net assets in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling interests are recognised at fair value or at the value based on market conditions. The liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities insofar as they represent present obligations arising from past events whose fair value may be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets allocated by the seller at the same time and following the same measurement criteria for the indemnification item of the acquired business, considering the risk of insolvency and any contractual restriction on the indemnified amount, as appropriate. The application of this criterion excludes non-current assets or disposable groups of elements classified as held for sale, liabilities for long-term defined benefits, transactions with payments based on equity instruments, deferred tax assets and liabilities and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of previously granted rights. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are classified and designated for subsequent recognition on the basis of contractual agreements, financial conditions, accounting and operating policies and other conditions existing on the acquisition date, with the exception of leases in which the business acquired is the landlord and of insurance contracts. Any excess existing between the consideration provided plus the value assigned to the non-controlling interests and the net amount of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In relation to any deficiency existing after assessing the amount of the consideration provided, the value assigned to the non-controlling interests and the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired are recognised as a separate item in the consolidated income statement. Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired as of 1 January 2004 are recorded on the acquisition date by the percentage held in the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired before the transition date were recognised by the percentage in equity on the date of first-time consolidation. Non-controlling interests are presented in consolidated net equity separately from the equity attributed to the Parent's shareholders. Non-controlling interests in consolidated profit or loss for the year and in consolidated total comprehensive income for the year are also presented for the year separately in the consolidated income statement and in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, respectively. ----- The Group's interest and the non-controlling interests in the consolidated profit or loss for the year (and in consolidated comprehensive income for the year) and in changes in net equity of the subsidiaries, after considering adjustments and eliminations arising from consolidation, are determined from ownership interests at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and after deducting the effect of dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights classified in net equity accounts. However, the Group's interest and the non-controlling interests are determined considering the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other financial derivatives that essentially grant current access to the returns associated with ownership of the subsidiaries. Any excess losses attributable to non-controlling interests generated prior to 1 January 2010, not attributable to these because they exceed the amount of the interest in the subsidiary's equity, are recorded as a decrease in net equity attributable to the Parent’s shareholders, except in those cases in which the noncontrolling interests have a binding obligation to assume all or part of the losses and have the ability to make the necessary additional investment. The profits obtained in subsequent years are assigned to the net equity attributable to the Parent’s shareholders, until the amount of the losses absorbed in prior reporting periods that correspond to non-controlling interests has been recovered. As of 1 January 2010, the profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are assigned to the net equity attributable to the Parent’s shareholders and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their interest, even if this entails a deficit balance of non-controlling interests. The agreements executed between the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction. Associates Associates are those entities over which the Parent exercises significant influence, directly or indirectly via subsidiaries. Significant influence is the power to participate in an entity's financial and operating policy decisions, without the existence of control or joint control. In determining the existence of significant influence, potential voting rights are considered, whether exercisable or convertible on the closing date of each year, and likewise considering any potential voting rights held by the Group or another entity. Investments in associates are recorded by the equity method from the date on which the significant influence is exercised to the date on which the Parent is unable to continue to justify its existence. Nevertheless, if on the acquisition date all or part of the investment complies with the conditions for classification as non-current assets or disposable groups of elements held for sale, it will be recorded at fair value less any costs to sell or of disposal by other means. Investments in associates are initially recognised at their acquisition cost, additionally including any additional cost directly attributable to the acquisition and any contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that depends on future events or on the fulfilment of certain conditions. The excess between the investment cost and the percentage corresponding to the Group in the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill, which is included in the investment's book value. Any deficiency, after measuring the amounts of the investment cost and identification and assessment of the associate's net assets, is recorded as revenue in determining the investor's interest in the associate's profit or loss for the year of its acquisition. If the investment results in the loss of control of a subsidiary that does not constitute a business, the cost of the investment is the fair value, net of any eliminations from the results of the loss of control. The accounting policies of associates were subject to timing and measurement unification in the same terms as those referenced for subsidiaries. The Group's interest in the profits or losses of associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments with a credit or debit to “Profit/(Loss) of companies accounted for using the equity method” of the consolidated income statement. Likewise, the Group's interest ----- in profits or losses of associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments in the associates, recognising the itemised consideration in other comprehensive income. Dividend distributions are recorded as decreases in the investment values. The Group's interest in profits or losses, including impairment losses recognised by the associates, will consider revenue or expenses deriving from the acquisition method. The Group's interest in the profits or losses of the associates and in the changes in net equity is determined on the basis of its ownership interest at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights. However, the Group's interest is determined considering the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other financial derivatives which at present essentially grant access to the returns relating to associate ownership interest. The Group's interest in the profits or losses of the associates is recorded after considering the effect of the dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights classified in net equity accounts. The losses in associates that correspond to the Group are limited to the net investment value, except in those cases in which the Group has assumed legal or implicit obligations, or has made payments on behalf of the associates. To recognise impairment losses in associates, the net investment is considered as the result of adding the book value resulting from the application of the equity method to the one that corresponds to any other item that essentially forms part of the investment in the associates. Any excess of losses on the investment in equity instruments is applied to the rest of the items in reverse order of priority on liquidation. The profits subsequently obtained by those associates in which recognition of losses is limited to the value of the investment are recorded to the extent that they exceed any losses not previously recognised. The Group applies financial instrument measurement criteria to the other items that form part of the net investment and to which the equity method is not applied, prior to recognising the aforementioned losses. In applying those criteria, the Group does not consider the recognition of losses deriving from the equity method in the book value of these items. As a result of this, the measurement criteria of those items at fair value and value impairment, where appropriate, change the recognition of the losses deriving from the equity method in prior periods and the year underway. Profits and losses not realised in transactions performed between the Group and associates are only recognised to the extent that they correspond to unrelated investors' interests. The recognition of unrealised losses that constitute proof of impairment of the transferred asset are excluded from the application of this criterion. However, profits and losses deriving from transactions between the Group and associates of net assets that constitute a business will be recognised in their entirety. Unrealised profits or losses of non-monetary contributions of assets to associates that do not constitute a Group business are recorded in accordance with the value of the transactions. In this regard, if the transferred assets remain in the associate and the transaction is commercial in nature, only the proportional part of the profits or losses that correspond to the rest of the investors is recognised. Otherwise, no profit or loss is recognised for the transaction. Deferred profit or loss is recognised against the value of the interest. Furthermore, unrealised losses are eliminated insofar as they do not constitute proof of impairment of the transferred asset. If in the non-monetary contribution and in addition to the interest, the Group receives monetary or non-monetary assets, the profit or loss of the transaction corresponding to the latter is recognised. In non-monetary contributions of Group businesses to associates, profits and losses are recognised in their entirety. The Group applies the criteria indicated in the financial instrument accounting policy, including any impairment adjustments to the other financial instruments to which the equity method is not applied, including those that form part of the net investment in the associate. ----- The recognition of losses from applying the equity method or impairment of the financial instruments that form part of the net investment in the associate are not considered in applying the measurement criteria indicated in the financial instrument policy. Once the equity method is applied, the Group assesses whether objective evidence of net impairment exists in the associate. Calculation of impairment is determined as a result of the comparison of the book value relating to the net investment in the associate with its recoverable value, with recoverable value deemed to be the greater of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell or of disposal by other means. In this connection, the value in use is calculated on the basis of the Group's interest in the present value of the estimated cash flows from ordinary activities and from any amounts that could result from the final sale of the associate. The recoverable amount of the investment in an associate is measured with regard to each associate, unless it is not a cash generating unit (CGU). The impairment loss is not assigned to goodwill or to other implicit assets in the investment in associates deriving from the application of the acquisition method. In subsequent years value reversals of investments are recognised against profit or loss, to the extent that an increase in recoverable value exists. Impairment loss is presented separately from the Group's interest in associate profit or loss. Joint agreements Joint agreements are considered to be those in which a contractual agreement exists to share control over an economic activity, so that any decisions on relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group and the rest of the investors or operators. The assessment of the existence of joint control takes place by considering the subsidiaries' definition of control. i) Joint operations In joint operations, the Group recognises its assets in the consolidated financial statements, including its interest in jointly-controlled assets; its liabilities, including its interest in any liabilities incurred jointly with other operators; the revenue obtained from the sale of its part of the production deriving from the joint operation, its part of revenue obtained from the sale of the production deriving from the joint operation, its expenses, including the part of the joint expenses that corresponds to it. The Group's acquisition of the initial and subsequent interest in a joint operation constituting a business is recognised by applying the criteria for business combinations as the percentage interest it holds in the individual assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, in the subsequent acquisition of additional interest in a joint operation, the prior interest in the individual assets and liabilities is not subject to revaluation, insofar as the Group maintains joint control. In sale or contribution transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit or loss corresponding to the interest of the rest of the operators is recognised, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or impairment of the assets transferred, in which case they are recognised in their entirety. In purchase transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit or loss is recognised when the assets acquired are sold to third parties, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or impairment of the assets acquired, in which case the Group recognises the proportional part of any losses that correspond to it in their entirety. ----- Transactions and balances in foreign currency i) Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, which is the Parent's functional and presentation currency, rounded off to the nearest thousand. ii) Transactions, balances and cash flows in foreign currency Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency on the dates on which the transactions take place. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into euros by applying the existing rate at year-end, while non-monetary ones measured at historical cost are translated by applying the exchange rights applied on the date on which the transaction took place. For these purposes, supplier and customer advances are considered non-monetary items, whereby they are translated at the exchange rate on the date on which the payment or collection took place. The subsequent posting of the reception of inventories or revenue from sales, for the part of the advance, takes place at the original exchange rate and not the one on the transaction date. Finally, the translation into euros of non-monetary assets measured at fair value is performed by applying the exchange rate on the date of their quantification. In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statement, flows from foreign currency transactions are translated into euros by applying the exchange rates existing on the date on which they took place. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are presented separately in the cash flow statement as “Effect of exchange rate differences on cash”. The differences revealed in the settlement of transactions in foreign currency and in the translation into euros of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are recognised in profit or loss. However, the exchange differences arising in monetary items that form part of the net business investment abroad are recorded as translation differences in other comprehensive income. Exchange gains or losses relating to monetary financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency are also recognised in profit or loss. Monetary financial assets denominated in foreign currency classified at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, are considered to be posted at amortised cost in the foreign currency and, therefore, the exchange differences associated with any changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit or loss and the rest of the change in fair value is recognised as set out in section i). The Group presents the effect of the translation of deferred tax assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency jointly with the deferred income tax in profit or loss). Exchange gains or losses of non-monetary financial assets and liabilities and monetary financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit or loss, are recognised jointly with a change in the fair value in other comprehensive income or in profit or loss. The rest of the change in fair value is recognised as set out in section i). Nevertheless, the component of the change to the exchange rate of equity instruments denominated in foreign currency and measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income and classified as fair value hedges of that component, is recognised in other comprehensive income. ----- iii) Translation of foreign businesses The Group availed itself of the exemption in IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, regarding cumulative translation differences, whereby the translation differences recognised in the consolidated financial statements generated prior to 1 January 2004 were included in reserves for cumulative gains. As of that date, the translation into euros of foreign businesses whose functional currency is not from a hyper-inflationary country was performed by the application of the following criteria: - Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and adjustments to net assets deriving from business acquisition, including comparative balances, are translated at the closing rate on the date of each balance sheet; - Revenue and expenses, including comparative balances, are translated at the exchange rates in force on the date of each transaction; and - Exchange rate differences resulting from the application of the above criteria are recognised as translation differences in other comprehensive income; This same criterion is applicable to the translation of financial statements of companies accounted for using the equity method, whose translation differences that correspond to the Group's interest are recognised in other comprehensive income. In the presentation of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows, including comparative balances, of foreign subsidiaries and joint businesses are translated into euros by applying exchange rates existing on the date on which they took place. Translation differences recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss, as an adjustment to the profit or loss from the sale, following the criteria set out in the sections on subsidiaries and associates.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Revenues and expenses and the profit or loss obtained relating to the companies disposed of and dissolved in the period from the beginning of 2023 and the date of disposal or dissolution thereof, were scantly material, as were net changes in the assets and liabilities of those companies over the same period, with the exception of Antolin Ebergassing, GmbH, the revenue and accumulated loss before taxes of which at the date of disposal amounted to 132,637 and 3,937 thousand euros, respectively. As a result of the disposal in 2023 of Grupo Antolin-Saint Petersburg, Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Nóvgorod, Ltd., Slovakian Door Company, s.r.o., Antolin Austria Holding, GmbH and Antolin Ebergassing, GmbH, together with the dissolution and liquidation of Chongqing Zhenneng Antolin Auto Parts, Co., Ltd., Antolin incurred a net loss of 5,065 thousand euros, which is recognised under “Gains or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests” of the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2023. Also, the effect of the addition of companies in the Group’s scope of consolidation in 2023 on the consolidated financial statements of the Group taken as a whole was scantly material. 2022: The changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in 2022 were as follows: - In March 2022, Antolin sold all of its 61% holding in the Chinese joint ventures Chongqing Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hangzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and Harbin Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., to their current shareholder, Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. - In March 2022 Antolin sold 100% of its ownership interest in the US subsidiary Antolin Spartanburg Assembly, Inc. to the Motus Integrated Technologies Group. ----- - In the second half of 2022 Antolin incorporated the Indian company Grupo Antolin Design and Business Services Private Limited, whose main object is to provide engineering and CAD services, as well as the North American companies Antolin Nashville, LLC and Antolin Insurance Company, LLC, in which the Group has a 100% interest in its share capital. - In July 2022 the Group acquired an additional 51% stake in the share capital of Wuhan Antolin Auto Parts, Co. Ltd, in which it had previously held 49%, for a price of practically zero. As a result of this transaction, the Group now has a 100% shareholding in said company and exercises control over it. Accordingly, this company, over which the Group exercised significant influence, has changed from an associate to a subsidiary and, in consequence, is now “fully consolidated”. - The dissolution and liquidation of the subsidiary Gestión Industrial de Sonora, S.A. de C.V., which was inactive. Also in 2022 the Group acquired the shareholding held by non-controlling interests in the subsidiary Wuhan Antolin Automotive Interiors Co., Ltd., over which the Group exercised control, for an amount of 1,379 thousand euros. As a result of this transaction, the Group's holding in this company increased from 51% to 100%. This transaction has not resulted in any changes to the scope of consolidation. The income and expenses and gains and losses derived from the companies disposed of during the period between the start of 2022 and the date on which these companies were disposed of or dissolved were of scant significance, and the net changes in their assets and liabilities over the same period were also immaterial. As a result of the sale of these companies, as well as the dissolution and liquidation of Gestión Industrial de Sonora, S.A. de C.V., the Group incurred a net loss of 324 thousand euros, which is recognised under “Gains or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests” in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2022. The effect of the additions of companies to the scope of consolidation in 2022 on the Group’s consolidated financial statements has not been significant. **(3)** **ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND MEASUREMENT CRITERIA** In preparing the consolidated financial statements for 2023 the following accounting principles and policies and measurement criteria were applied:",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1996,ASSETS-,1996.3,a) Goodwill-,1996.3.1,,"“Goodwill” is only recorded when it has been acquired for a consideration and represents, therefore, advance payments made by the acquiring entity for the future economic benefits deriving from the assets of the acquired entity that are not individually and separately identifiable and recognisable. Impairment losses In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment (i.e., a reduction in the recoverable amount of the “Goodwill” to below its book value) at the end of each reporting period and if there is any impairment, the goodwill is written down with a charge to “Net impairment losses on noncurrent assets” in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses relating to “Goodwill” cannot subsequently be reversed. ----- The recoverable value of goodwill and of other intangible and tangible assets is measured as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, understood to be the present value of expected future cash flows from the investment. The Group's Directors apply the following methodology to test goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment (see Notes 7 and 8): - The recoverable amounts are calculated for each cash generating unit (CGU). The goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to each one of the cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination synergies. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is assigned represents the lowest level in the entity at which goodwill is controlled for internal management purposes (see Note 7). For the purpose of intangible and tangible fixed assets, cash generating units are associated with the projects. - The Group's Directors regularly prepare a business plan for each cash generating unit, broken down by market and activity, covering a period of at least five years. An annual budget is also prepared each year for the following financial year. The main components of said plan and budget are: - Results forecasts. - Investment and working capital forecasts. - Other variables influencing the calculation of recoverable value are: - The discount rate to be applied, i.e., the weighted average cost of capital. The main factors affecting this are the cost of the liabilities and specific risks related to the assets. - The growth rate applied to cash flows to extrapolate them beyond the period covered by budgets and forecasts, up to five financial years. Forecasts are prepared on the basis of past experience and the best available estimates in line with externally obtained information. The business plans thus prepared are reviewed and approved by the Parent's Board of Directors. If an impairment loss must be recognised for a cash generating unit to which all or part of the goodwill has been assigned, first the book value of the goodwill corresponding to the cash generating unit will be reduced. If the impairment loss exceeds the amount of goodwill, the rest of assets allocated to the CGU are then written down, in proportion to their book values, up to the limit of the higher of the following: fair value less cost to sell, value in use and zero. At 2023 and 2022 year-end no goodwill impairment was recorded. “Goodwill” recognised in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 corresponds basically to the consolidated subsidiaries and plants acquired in 2015 from the international Magna Automotive group and other companies forming part of the “Lighting” business acquired from the “CML Innovative Technologies” group in 2012, and other non-material goodwill recognised (see Note 7).",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Development expenditure incurred using the Group's own resources are recorded (by type) in the consolidated income statement, while development expenditure for projects which meet the above conditions are debited against “Development expenditure” in the consolidated statement of financial position and credited to “Own work capitalised” in the consolidated income statement. Capitalised development expenditure are in practically all cases amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the projects as from the date the related projects are completed. Development expenditure relate mainly to the costs incurred in this connection by the consolidated subsidiary Grupo Antolin-Ingeniería, S.A.U. and the Group's other research and development centres. Research expenses are taken directly to income in the financial year in which they are incurred. Software and other intangible assets Other intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised accordingly, using criteria similar to those used to depreciate property, plant and equipment. Specifically, “Computer software” is written off over a period of 5 years as from when it starts to be used. When accounting for the business combination involving the companies and plants acquired in 2015 from the international Magna Automotive group, “Customer relations” in the automobile industry was identified as an intangible asset, on the basis that one of the Group's aims in carrying out said operation was to develop new services and products in this sector. This intangible asset has been measured at its fair value. The remaining useful life of this intangible asset was estimated between 2 and 7 years, over which period it will be amortised. The annual amortisation charge for intangible assets with finite useful lives is charged to “Depreciation and amortisation charge” in the consolidated income statement. Impairment losses The consolidated companies recognise any impairment loss in the book value of the assets associated with the CGUs with a charge to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement. The criteria used to recognise the impairment losses on these assets associated with the CGUs and, where applicable, the recovery of impairment losses recorded in prior years, are similar to those applied for property, plant and equipment for own use.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Property, plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at their acquisition or production cost, adjusted or revalued, whenever applicable, in accordance with applicable legal provisions, or at their “fair value” as determined by independent experts on the date of transition to IFRS-EU (1 January 2006) or the date of the business combination, the amount of which is recorded as an attributed cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. ----- The cost of extensions, modernisations or improvements that increase the productivity, capacity or efficiency or prolong the useful life of an asset are capitalised as an increase in the cost of said asset. Borrowing costs directly attributable to building or developing property, plant and equipment that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are ready to become operational. In cases where financing has been received specifically for building said assets, the amount of the interest and other finance costs capitalised reflects the actual costs incurred during the period, less income earned from temporarily reinvesting the financing that has not yet been invested in the qualifying assets. Where the financing received is of a general nature, the amount of interest capitalised is calculated using a rate based on the weighted average of the interest costs applicable to the average unrepaid financing in the year excluding financing for specific purposes. However, the capitalisation of interest is suspended during the periods in which the construction work is at a standstill, provided that such periods are not particularly long. In 2023 and 2022, the Group had not capitalised any finance costs as an increase in the book value of “Property, plant and equipment”. Upkeep and maintenance expenses for property, plant and equipment for own use are expensed in the year they are incurred. The Group transfers PP&E under construction to PP&E used in operations when the assets in question become operational, from which time depreciation is charged. Property, plant and equipment used in operations are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on the acquisition or production cost of the assets or their restated value, less their residual value. The land on which buildings and other constructions are located is deemed to have an indefinite lifespan and is therefore not subject to depreciation.

Depreciation is charged on these assets in accordance with the policies adopted for similar PP&E items for own use, and the revenues from the lease contracts are released to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis. _As lessee-_ In agreements that contain one or more lease and non-lease components, the Group assigns the consideration to each lease component in accordance with the separate sale price of the lease component and the individual aggregate price of the various lease components. Payments made by the Group that do not entail the transfer of goods or services to it by the lessor do not constitute a separate lease component, and instead form part of the total lease consideration. At the start of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset comprises the amount of the lease liability, any lease payment made on or prior to the starting date, less any incentives received, any direct start-up costs incurred and an estimate of the decommissioning or restoration costs to be incurred, as indicated in the provision accounting policy. The Group measures the lease liability as the present value of outstanding lease payments on the starting date. The Group discounts lease payments at the appropriate incremental interest rate, unless the lessor's implicit interest rate can be reliably determined. Outstanding lease payments are composed of fixed payments, less any incentive receivable, variable payments dependent on an index or rate, initially measured by the index or rate applicable on the starting date, amounts to be paid by residual value guarantees, the price for the purchase option whose exercise is reasonably expected and the payments of compensation for lease cancellation, providing the term of the lease reflects the exercise of the cancellation option. The Group measures right-of-use assets at cost, less any depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, adjusted by any re-calculation of the lease liability. If the agreement transfers ownership of the asset to the Group at the end of the lease or the right-of-use asset includes the purchase option price, the depreciation method indicated in the property, plant and equipment section from the starting date of the lease to the end of the useful life of the asset is applied. Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the starting date to the earlier date between the useful life of the right or the end of the lease term. The Group applies non-current asset impairment loss criteria to the right-of-use asset, in accordance with the contents of Notes 3-b, 3-c and 3-d. The Group measures lease liability by increasing it by the accrued financial expense, decreasing it by payments made and re-calculating the book value for lease modifications or to reflect updates of in-substance fixed ----- The Group records variable payments not included in the initial measurement of profit/(loss) for the period in which the events that trigger its payment take place. The Group records liability re-calculations as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset, until this is reduced to zero and subsequently in profit/(loss). The Group reassesses the lease liability, discounting lease payments at an updated rate, if a change to the term of the lease or a change in the expectations of exercising the purchase option for the underlying asset take place. The Group reassesses the lease liability if a change takes place in the amounts to be paid by residual value guarantees or a change to the index or rate used to determine the payments, including a change to reflect changes in market rents once a revision takes place. The Group recognises a lease modification as a separate lease if this increases the scope of the lease by adding one or more usage rights and the amount of the consideration for the lease increases by an amount consistent with the individual price for the increase in scope, and any adjustment to the individual price to reflect the specific circumstances of the contract. If the modification does not result in a separate lease on the modification date, the Group assigns the consideration to the modified lease as indicated above, re-determines the lease term and reassesses the value of the liability less the revised payments at the revised interest rate. The Group decreases the book value of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or total conclusion of the lease, in those modifications that decrease the scope of the lease and records it in profit/(loss). For all other modifications the Group adjusts the book value of the right-of-use asset. _i)_ _Short-term leases and leases where the asset is of low value-_ The Group applies the exemptions for recognising short-term leases _(those leases with terms of 12 _months or less from the inception date and that do not include a purchase option) and leases in which the_ underlying asset is of low value (for example, less than 6,000 euros). The lease payments deriving from these contracts are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term under “Other operating expenses” in the consolidated income statement. _ii)_ _Establishing the lease terms of contracts with options to extend-_ The Group establishes the lease term as the irrevocable period of a lease plus: (i) any periods covered by an option to extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise this option; and (ii) any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will not exercise this option. When evaluating if it is reasonably likely the option to extend a lease will be exercised or the option to terminate a lease will not be exercised, the Group takes into account any relevant events and circumstances prompting the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease or not exercise the option to terminate the lease. After the inception date, the Group will re-evaluate the lease term whenever there is a significant event or change in the circumstances under the Group's control which affects whether or not there is reasonable certainty the options will or will not be exercised.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Assets classified as “Non-current assets held for sale” are stated at the lower of their book value ----- when they are classified as such and their fair value net of their estimated cost to sell. Amortisable intangible assets and depreciable PP&E are not amortised or depreciated while classified as held for sale. In 2022 and 2021 the Group held land in Tangiers (Morocco) acquired in 2014 classified under “Non-current assets held for sale”. Based on assessments made by an independent expert and offers recently received, the fair value of this building is at least equal to its book value. It is expected to be sold over the next twelve months.

Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party bound to a contract or legal transaction in accordance with its provisions. For valuation purposes, the Group classifies financial instruments in categories of financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), separating those initially designated from those held for trading or obligatorily measured at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, separating equity instruments designated as such from the rest of the financial assets. The Group classifies financial assets, other than those designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss) and equity instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income in accordance with the ----- measured at amortised cost, except those designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss) and those held for trading. The Group classifies a financial asset or liability as held for trading if: - It is acquired or incurred mainly to sell or repurchase it in the immediate future; - During initial recognition it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that are jointly managed and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking; - It is a derivative, except a derivative designated as a hedging instrument and complies with conditions for effectiveness, and a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract, or - It is an obligation to deliver financial assets borrowed but not yet owned. The Group classifies a financial asset at amortised cost, if it is maintained within the scope of a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows and the contractual conditions of the financial asset generate, on specified dates, cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only on the amount of outstanding principle. The Group classifies a financial asset at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income if it is maintained within the scope of a business model whose objective is attained by obtaining contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual conditions of the financial asset generate, on specified dates, cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only. The business model is determined by core Group personnel and at a level that reflects the way in which groups of financial assets are jointly managed to attain a specific business objective. The Group's business model represents the way in which it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections throughout the instrument's life. The Group manages the assets held in the portfolio to collect the specific contractual cash flows. To determine whether the cash flows are obtained through the collection of contractual cash flows from the financial assets, the Group considers the frequency, value and sale calendar in prior years, the reasons for those sales and expectations with regard to future sales activity. Nevertheless, the sales themselves do not determine the business model and, therefore, may not be considered on their own. Instead, it is the information on past sales and future sale expectations that provides indicative data on the means of attaining the Group's stated purpose with respect to the management of financial assets and, more specifically, the way in which cash flows are obtained. The Group considers the information on past sales within the context of the reasons for these sales and of the conditions that existed at that time in comparison with current ones. For these purposes, the Group considers that trade and other receivables that will be transferred to third parties and do not involve derecognition are maintained in this business model. While the purpose of the Group's business model is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows, the Group does not hold all instruments to maturity. Thus, the Group's business model is holding financial assets to receive contractual cash flows even when sales of those assets take place or are expected to take place in the future. The Group understands that it complies with the requirement, providing that the sales occur owing to an increased credit risk of the financial assets. In all other cases, at the individual and aggregate level, sales must be of minor significance, whether they are frequent or infrequent, even if they may be significant. Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell them, are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections and to sell them according to the Group's varying needs. In this type of business model and in order to comply with this objective, the Group's core management personnel have decided that the attainment of contractual cash flows and sale of financial assets are essential. To achieve this objective, the Group obtains contractual cash flows and sells financial assets. Compared to the previous business model, in this business model the Group regularly makes asset sales more frequently and of greater value. ----- The contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only are consistent with a basic loan agreement. In a basic loan agreement, the most significant elements of interest are generally the consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk. Nevertheless, in an agreement of this type, the interest also includes the consideration for other risks, such as the risk of liquidity and costs, like the administrative costs of a basic loan associated with holding the financial asset for a given period. Furthermore, the interest may include a profit mark-up that may be consistent with a basic loan agreement. The Group designates a financial asset initially at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), if by doing so it eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition that may otherwise arise, if the measurement of the assets or liabilities or recognition of the profit/(loss) were to take place made on different bases. All other financial assets are classified at fair value with changes in profit/(loss). Financial assets and liabilities arising from contingent consideration in a business combination are classified as financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit/(loss). The Group initially designates a financial liability at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), if by doing so it eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition of its profit/(loss) that would otherwise derive, if the assets or liability or the recognition of the profit/(loss) is made on different bases or a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and liabilities is managed, and its return is evaluated, based on fair value, in keeping with an investment or documented risk management strategy, and information is furnished internally to that group on that same basis to the Group's core management personnel. The Group classifies all other financial liabilities, except financial guarantee contracts, loan commitments below market interest rate and financial liabilities resulting from a transfer of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition or are recorded using the continuing involvement approach, as financial liabilities at amortised cost. _Offset principles-_ Financial assets and financial liabilities may be offset only when the Group currently has the legal right to offset recognised amounts and intends to settle by offset or simultaneously realise the assets and cancel the liabilities. For the Group to have the currently legal right, it may not be contingent on a future event and should be legally required in the ordinary course of operations, in the event of insolvency or legally declared liquidation and in the event of non-payment. _Financial assets measured at cost-_ Investments in equity instruments for which there is insufficient information for measurement or in which a broad range of measurements exist and the related derivatives have to be settled by the delivery of those investments, are measured at cost. However, if the Group may at any time have a reliable measurement of the asset or the contract, these will be recognised at fair value at that time, recording the profits or losses in profit/(loss) or other comprehensive income, if the instrument is designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. _Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost- Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost are initially recognised at their fair value, plus or minus any transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest_ method. ----- _Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit/(Ioss)-_ Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit/(loss) are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase or issue are recognised as an expense when they are incurred. Initially, the fair value of a financial instrument is normally the transaction price, unless that price contains several instrument elements, in which case the Group determines its fair value. If the Group determines that an instrument's fair value differs from the transaction price, it records the difference in profit/(loss), to the extent that the value is obtained by reference to a price of an identical asset or liability quoted on an active market, or was obtained by a valuation technique that only uses observable data. In other cases, the Group recognises the difference in profit/(loss), to the extent that it derives from a change in a factor that market participants would consider when determining the price of the asset or liability. Subsequently to its initial recognition, it is recognised at fair value with changes in profit/(loss). Changes in fair value include the interest and dividend component. Fair value does not decrease due to the transaction costs that may be incurred through its eventual sale or disposal by other means. Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), the Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income. Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income statement. The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the internal rate of return at the start of the period using fair value and contractual cash flows, and deducts the reference interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, providing that the change in reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could entail significant changes to fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change linked to the credit risk. Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), the Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income. Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income statement. The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the internal rate of return at the start of the period using fair value and contractual cash flows, and deducts the reference interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, providing that the change in reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could entail significant changes to the fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change linked to the credit risk. _Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income- Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair_ value plus any transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase. Following initial recognition, the financial assets classified in this category are measured at fair value, recognising profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the exception of profit and loss by exchange rate, as set out in the section on foreign currency transactions, and expected credit losses. The amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit/(loss) as soon as financial asset derecognition takes place. However, the interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised ----- As indicated above, the Group has designated certain equity instruments as measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. Following initial recognition, the equity instruments are measured at fair value, recognising the profit or loss in other comprehensive income. The amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are not re-classified to profit/(loss), without prejudice to their re-classification to reserves at the moment of instrument derecognition. _Fair value of financial instruments-_ The “fair value” of a financial instrument on a particular date is defined as the amount at which it could have been exchanged at that date between knowledgeable parties in arm's length transactions. The most objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid for it on an organised, transparent and deep market (“quoted price” or “market price”). When there is no market price for a specific financial instrument, fair value is estimated on the basis of recent arm's length transactions in similar instruments and, if there are none, using measurement models that have been sufficiently verified by the international financial community, bearing in mind the specific nature of the instrument to be valued and, in particular, the different types of risk associated with it. For financial reporting purposes, measurements of fair value are classified under three levels according to the extent to which the inputs applied are observable and according to how significant said inputs are for the entire measurement: - Level 1: inputs are quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs are quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities (not included within Level _1), quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and techniques_ based on measurement models for which all the significant inputs are derived from or corroborated by observable market data. - Level 3: inputs are generally unobservable and reflect estimates based on market assumptions to determine the price of the asset or liability. Unobservable data used in measurement models are a significant part of the fair value of the assets and liabilities. _Impairment-_ Since 1 January 2018, financial assets valued at amortised cost, trade receivables and other loans, in addition to financial guarantee contracts, have been subject to the recording of an impairment loss based on the expected loss of credit, either at 12 months (assets classified as investments available for sale) or over the whole lifetime (trade debtor accounts). In order to calculate the impairment loss based on the expected loss, the Group has established a model which requires estimates of future credit losses using a simplified approach. Given the nature, conditions and high credit quality of its accounts receivable and loans, the amount of impairment losses required as a result of the application of the new model to the financial asset balances is usually of little significance. _Financial instrument derecognition, modifications or cancellations-_ The Group applies financial asset derecognition criteria to part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets, or to financial assets or a group of similar financial assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them are terminated or transferred, and the Group substantially transfers the risks and benefits deriving from their ownership. Furthermore, the derecognition of financial assets in those circumstances in which the Group retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows only occurs when contractual obligations that determine the payment of those flows to one or more recipients have been assumed, and the following requirements are fulfilled: - Payment of cash flows is conditioned on its prior collection; ----- - The Group may not proceed to sell or pledge the financial asset; and - Cash flows collected on behalf of the eventual recipients are sent with significant delay, and the Group is not entitled to reinvest the cash flows. The application of this criterion does not include investments in cash or cash equivalents made by the Group during the settlement period between the collection date and delivery date stipulated with the eventual recipients, providing any interest accrued is attributed to the eventual recipients. In those cases in which the Group transfers a financial asset in its entirety but retains the administration rights to them in exchange for a fee, an asset or liability is recognised in keeping with the rendering of that service. If the consideration received is less than the expenses to be incurred as a result of rendering the service, a liability is recognised for an amount equivalent to the obligations assumed measured at fair value. If the consideration for the service is greater than what would result from applying adequate remuneration, an asset is recognised for the administration rights. In transactions in which the total derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the financial assets obtained or the financial liabilities, including the liabilities corresponding to administration services incurred, are recorded at fair value. In transactions in which the partial derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the book value of the complete financial asset is assigned to the part sold and to the part held, including any assets corresponding to administration services, in proportion to the relative fair value of each of them. The total derecognition of a financial asset entails the recognition of profit/(loss) of the difference between its book value and the sum of the consideration received, net of transaction expenses, including any assets obtained or liabilities assumed and any deferred profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the exception of equity instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. The criteria for the derecognition of financial assets in transactions in which the Group neither transfers nor substantially maintains the risks and benefits inherent to ownership are based on the analysis of the degree of control maintained. In this way: - If the Group does not retain control, the financial asset is derecognised and any rights or obligations created or retained as a result of the transfer are recognised separately as assets or liabilities. - If the control is retained, the financial asset will continue to be recognised for the Group's continued commitment in it and an associated liability is recorded. The continued commitment in the financial asset is determined by the amount of its exposure to changes in value of that asset. The associated asset and liability are measured on the basis of the rights and obligations recognised by the Group. The associated liability is recognised so that the book value of the asset and associated liability is equal to the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by the Group, when the asset is measured at amortised cost, or at the fair value of the rights and obligations maintained by the Group if the asset is measured at fair value. The Group continues to recognise revenue deriving from the asset to the extent of its continued commitment and expenses deriving from the associated liability. Changes in the fair value of the asset and associated liability are consistently recognised in profit/(loss) or in equity, in keeping with the general recognition criteria set out above, and should not be offset. Those transactions in which the Group substantially retains all risks and benefits inherent to the ownership of a transferred financial asset are recorded by recognition of the consideration received in the liability accounts. Transaction expenses are recognised in profit/(loss) following the effective interest method. The Group applies weighted average price criteria to measure and derecognise the cost of equity instruments that form part of homogeneous portfolios and that have the same rights, unless the instruments sold and their individual cost may be clearly identified. For debt instruments, it determines the cost at the individual or group level consistently with the unit of account used to determine impairment ----- If the Group modifies the contractual cash flows of a financial asset, insofar as this does not entail its derecognition, the book value is re-calculated by the present value of the flows modified at the effective interest rate or effective interest rate adjusted by the original credit risk, and recognises the difference in profit/(loss). The costs and fees invoiced by the Group adjust the book value of the financial asset and depreciates them during the remaining life of the modified financial asset. At 31 December 2022 the outstanding receivables transferred without recourse to financial institutions and pending maturity at that date amounted to 122,605 thousand euros (86,264 thousand euros at 31 December _2021). Interest and dividends-_ The Group recognises interest by the effective interest method, which is the update rate that makes a financial instrument's book value equal to the estimated cash flows throughout the instrument's expected life, based on its contractual conditions and without considering expected credit losses, except for financial assets acquired or arising from incurred losses. The interest recognised on the gross book value of the financial assets, except for financial assets acquired or arising from incurred credit losses and financial assets with impaired credit. For the former, the Group recognises interest by the effective interest rate adjusted by the initial credit risk, and for the latter, the Group recognises the interest on the amortised cost. Changes in cash flow estimates are deducted at the effective interest rate or the interest rate adjusted by the original credit risk and are recognised in profit/(loss). Revenue for dividends from investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit/(loss) when rights arise for the Group upon collecting them, financial profit collection is probable, and the amount may be reliably estimated. Dividends from equity instruments classified at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit/(loss), unless they represent a return on the investment, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group recognises default interest in commercial transactions as financial income and expenses in keeping with the legal and contractual conditions stipulated. If that interest is ultimately offset or condoned, the Group recognises the transaction in accordance with its substance. The Group recognises the legal right to offset collection management costs incurred when collection is probable. The Group recognises the expense for the claim of collection management costs as indicated in the provision accounting policy. _Financial liability derecognition and modification-_ The Group derecognises a financial liability or part thereof following compliance with the obligation contained in the liability or when it is legally dispensed from the main accountability in the liability, whether by judicial process or by the creditor. The exchange of debt instruments between the Group and the counterparty or substantial modifications to initially recognised liabilities are recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability, providing that the instruments have substantially different conditions. The Group considers the conditions to be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows deducted under the new conditions, including any fee paid net of any fee received, and using the original effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by at least 10% from the present discounted value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. If the exchange is recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability the costs or fees are recognised ----- effective interest rate, recognising any difference with the prior book value in profit/(loss). Furthermore, the costs or fees adjust the book value of the financial liabilities and are amortised by the amortised cost method during the remaining life of the modified liability. The Group recognises the difference between the book value of the financial liability or part thereof that is cancelled or transferred to a third party and the consideration paid, including any asset transferred other than the cash or liability assumed in profit/(loss).",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group, arising as a result of past events, which depend on whether or not one or more events beyond the Group's control occur in the future. They include the Group's current obligations whose settlement will probably not require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, or where a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be made. Provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position wherever it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, but rather, whenever applicable, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Provisions are measured using the best information available of the expenditures required to settle the obligation and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the current best estimate. They are used to meet the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised and are fully or partially reversed when those obligations cease to exist or are reduced. The value of these provisions corresponds to the current value of the best estimate possible of the amount necessary to cancel or transfer the obligation, recording the adjustments made from updating said provisions as financial costs as they accrue. Specifically, the liabilities recorded under “Current provisions” in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 correspond to provisions made to cover losses which certain subsidiaries are expected to incur to comply with contracts signed prior to the end of the reporting period and whose costs will exceed the expected returns generated.

These commitments affect, primarily, group companies located in Germany, Austria, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico and India. A significant portion of these commitments has been outsourced and is covered by insurance policies or pension plans with insurance companies. The Group pays fixed contributions into a fund and is obliged to make additional contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all the employees the benefits to which it is committed. The Group records the present value of these defined benefit commitments as liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position under “Non-current provisions”, net of the fair value of the assets that meet the requirements to be treated as “assets earmarked for the plan”. The aforementioned insurance policies _(or pension plans) are treated as earmarked assets as they are not owned by the Group but by an unrelated_ third party, they may only be used to pay or finance employee benefits and may not be returned to the Group unless the assets held within the plan are sufficient to meet all obligations. Changes in the provision recognised for these commitments in the consolidated statement of financial position corresponding to the cost of the services during the current period or to interest, are taken to the consolidated income statement in the financial year in which they are incurred, to the extent that “actuarial profits and losses” _(that result from differences existing between previous actuarial assumptions and real outcomes and changes to the actuarial assumptions used)_ are taken directly to equity as “Adjustments for changes in value”.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Until 31 December 2014 the parent of the consolidated tax group was Grupo AntolinIrausa, S.A.U. Since 1 January 2015 the parent of the consolidated tax group under which these companies file has been Avot Inversiones, S.L., the Group's indirect shareholder (see Notes 1, 13 and 19). The income tax expense is calculated as the tax payable with respect to the taxable profit for the year, after considering any changes in the assets and liabilities recognised arising from timing differences and from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards (see Note 19). The Group considers that a timing difference exists when there is a difference between the book value of an asset or liability and its tax base. The tax base for assets and liabilities is treated as the amount attributed to it for tax purposes. A taxable timing difference is understood to be a difference that will generate a future obligation for the Group to pay taxes to the relevant tax authorities. A deductible timing difference is one that will generate a right for the Group to a refund or to make a lower payment to the relevant tax authorities in the future. Tax credits and deductions and tax loss carryforwards are amounts that, after performance of the activity or generation of the profit or loss giving entitlement to them, are not used for tax purposes in the related tax return until the conditions for doing so established in tax regulations are met, provided that the Group considers it probable that they will be used in future periods ----- Current tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the related tax authorities within twelve months from the date they are recognised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are those amounts that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the relevant tax authorities in future years. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences. In this regard, a deferred tax liability is recognised for the taxable timing differences resulting from investments in subsidiaries and associate companies, and from holdings in joint ventures, except when the Group can control the reversal of the timing differences and they are not expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future. The consolidated companies only recognise deferred tax assets arising from deductible timing differences and from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that they will have sufficient future taxable profits against which these assets can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability (other than in a business combination) that at the time of recognition affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are reassessed each year in order to ascertain whether they still exist, and the appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed. _Tax uncertainties-_ If the Group determines that it is not likely that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment or a group of uncertain tax treatments, it considers that uncertainty in determining taxable income, tax bases, tax loss carryforwards, deductions or tax rates. The Group determines the effect of the uncertainty in the corporate income tax return by the expected value method, when the range of possible outcomes is highly disperse or the most probable outcome method, when the outcome is binary or concentrated around one amount. In those cases in which the tax asset or liability calculated with these criteria exceeds the selfassessed amount, it is presented as current or non-current in the consolidated statement of financial position according to the expected recovery or settlement date and considering, where appropriate, the amount of any corresponding default interest on the liability as it accrues in the income statement. The Group records changes in events and circumstances on tax uncertainties as a change in estimate. The Group recognises and presents penalties in keeping with the accounting policy for provisions. _Offset and classification-_ The Group only offsets tax assets and liabilities on current income tax if a legal right exists vis-à-vis the tax authorities and it intends to settle any resulting debts at its net amount, or realise the assets and settle the debts simultaneously. The Group only offsets tax assets and liabilities on deferred income tax if a legal offset right exists vis-à-vis the tax authorities and those assets and liabilities correspond to the same tax authority, and to the same taxpayer or to different taxpayers that seek to settle or realise the current tax assets and liabilities at their net amount or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each one of the future tax periods in which they expect to settle or recover significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities.

Ordinary revenue represents the transfer of goods or services promised to customers for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to have a right in exchange for those goods and services. Five steps are established for the recognition of revenue: ─ Identify the customer contract/s. ─ Identify the performance obligations. ─ Determine the transaction price. ─ Assign the transaction price to the various performance obligations. ─ Recognise the revenue according to fulfilment of each obligation. On the basis of this recognition model, sales of goods are recognised when the products are delivered to the customer and the customer accepts them, even if they have not yet been invoiced or, if applicable, the services have been rendered and it is reasonably assured that the corresponding receivable will be collected. Expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, immediately in the case of outlays that are not going to generate future financial profits or when they fail to comply with the necessary requirements for asset recognition. Income and expenses are taken to the consolidated income statement on an accrual basis. ❖ Revenues on sales of assets are recognised when control of the assets is transferred, which generally occurs when the assets are delivered (sent to the customer's specific location). The Group engages in the manufacture and sale of parts for the automotive sector. While the parts are exclusively designed and manufactured for the customers and have no alternative uses for the Group, revenue is recognised when control over them is transferred and not over time, since the Group does not have an unconditional collection right for the execution performed at the close of each year. ❖ Revenues on the sale of project tools. To be able to specifically manufacture the parts for customers, the Group incurs costs for mould design and manufacture. Once manufactured and approved by the customers, the moulds become customer property and the contracts indicate a separate price for these. To recognise this revenue, the Group follows the criteria under “Net Turnover” in the consolidated income statement, when control of the tools is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs when they pass the corresponding technical certification or verification by the customer. The Company's Directors consider that even when the tools made for customers have no alternative use for the Group, in the event that the order is rescinded by the customer, the Group has no right to receive payment for performance until that date, given that it would only have the right to collect the costs incurred but not to a reasonable profit margin. For this reason, tool manufacture is recorded as a performance obligation satisfied at a specific moment. Amounts billed in advance by the Group until control of these tools has been transferred are recorded as a liability under “Trade and other payables” on the consolidated statement of financial position. Moreover, any final losses expected to be sustained on tools are recognised in full when such a loss becomes apparent, and the related provisions are recognised under this heading in the consolidated income statement. ----- ii) Recognition of other revenue ❖ Ordinary revenue from the provision of services is recognised in line with the stage of completion of the transaction as at the end of the reporting period. ❖ Rental income is recorded on an accrual basis, with incentive benefits and the up-front costs of the lease agreements released on a straight-line basis. ❖ Capital grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as deferred income when the Group has met the relevant qualifying conditions and there are, therefore, no reasonable doubts about their being collected. These capital grants are taken to the consolidated income statement under “Capital grants and other grants taken to income” on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the assets. Government grants to cover or finance expenses incurred by the Group are recognised once all the conditions attaching to them have been fulfilled and will be taken to income when the financed expenses are incurred. ❖ Interest income and expense is recognised on an accrual basis using the “effective interest rate method”. ❖ Dividends received from other companies are recognised as income in the income statement when the consolidated companies' right to receive them arises. An expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement when there is a decrease in the future economic benefits related to a reduction of an asset, or an increase in a liability, which can be measured reliably. This means that the recognition of an expense takes place simultaneously with the recognition of the increase in the liability or the depletion of the asset. An expense is recognised immediately when a disbursement does not give rise to future economic benefits or when the requirements for recognition as an asset are not met. An expense is also recognised when a liability is incurred and no asset is recognised, as in the case of a liability relating to a guarantee.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Depreciation is charged on these assets in accordance with the policies adopted for similar PP&E items for own use, and the revenues from the lease contracts are released to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis. As lessee In agreements that contain one or more lease and non-lease components, the Group assigns the consideration to each lease component in accordance with the separate sale price of the lease component and the individual aggregate price of the various lease components. Payments made by the Group that do not entail the transfer of goods or services to it by the lessor do not constitute a separate lease component, and instead form part of the total lease consideration. At the start of the lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset comprises the amount of the lease liability, any lease payment made on or prior to the starting date, less any incentives received, any direct start-up costs incurred and an estimate of the decommissioning or restoration costs to be incurred, as indicated in the provision accounting policy. The Group measures the lease liability as the present value of outstanding lease payments on the starting date. The Group discounts lease payments at the appropriate incremental interest rate, unless the lessor's implicit interest rate can be reliably determined. Outstanding lease payments are composed of fixed payments, less any incentive receivable, variable payments dependent on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate applicable on the inception date, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, the price for the purchase option whose exercise is reasonably expected and the payments of compensation for lease cancellation, provided that the term of the lease reflects the exercise of the cancellation option.

If the agreement transfers ownership of the asset to the Group at the end of the lease or the right-of-use asset includes the purchase option price, the depreciation method indicated in the property, plant and equipment section from the inception date of the lease to the end of the useful life of the asset is applied. Otherwise, the Group depreciates the right-of-use asset from the starting date to the earlier date between the useful life of the right or the end of the lease term. ----- The Group applies non-current asset impairment loss criteria to the right-of-use asset, in accordance with the contents of Notes 3-a, 3-b and 3-c. The Group measures lease liability by increasing it by the accrued financial expense, decreasing it by payments made and re-calculating the book value for lease modifications or to reflect updates of in-substance fixed payments. The Group records variable payments not included in the initial measurement of profit or loss for the period in which the events that trigger its payment take place. The Group records liability re-calculations as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset until this is reduced to zero and subsequently in profit or loss. The Group reassesses the lease liability by discounting lease payments at an updated rate, if a change in the term of the lease or a change in the expectations of exercising the purchase option for the underlying asset take place. The Group reassesses the lease liability if a change takes place in the amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees or in the index or rate used to determine the payments, including a change to reflect changes in market rents once a revision takes place. The Group recognises a lease modification as a separate lease if this increases the scope of the lease by adding one or more usage rights and the amount of the consideration for the lease increases by an amount consistent with the individual price for the increase in scope, and any adjustment to the individual price to reflect the specific circumstances of the contract. If the modification does not result in a separate lease on the modification date, the Group assigns the consideration to the modified lease as indicated above, re-determines the lease term and reassesses the value of the liability less the revised payments at the revised interest rate. The Group decreases the book value of the right-of-use asset to reflect the partial or total conclusion of the lease, in those modifications that decrease the scope of the lease and records it in profit or loss. For all other modifications the Group adjusts the book value of the right-of-use asset. i) Short-term leases and leases where the asset is of low value The Group applies the exemptions for recognising short-term leases (those leases with terms of 12 months or less from the inception date and that do not include a purchase option) and leases in which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments deriving from these contracts are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term under “Other operating expenses” in the consolidated income statement. ii) Establishing the lease terms of contracts with options to extend The Group establishes the lease term as the irrevocable period of a lease plus: (i) any periods covered by an option to extend the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise this option; and (ii) any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain that it will not exercise this option. When evaluating if it is reasonably likely the option to extend a lease will be exercised or the option to terminate a lease will not be exercised, the Group takes into account any relevant events and circumstances prompting the Group to exercise the option to extend the lease or not exercise the option to terminate the lease. ----- After the inception date, the Group will re-evaluate the lease term whenever there is a significant event or change in the circumstances under the Group's control which affects whether or not there is reasonable certainty the options will or will not be exercised.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Assets classified as “Non-current assets held for sale” are stated at the lower of their book value when they are classified as such and their fair value net of their estimated cost to sell. Amortisable intangible assets and depreciable PP&E are not amortised or depreciated while classified as held for sale. In 2023 and 2022 the Group held land in Tangiers (Morocco) acquired in 2014, which is classified under “Non-current assets held for sale”.

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1996,ASSETS-,1996.13,h) Financial instruments-,1996.13.1,,"Recognition and classification of financial instruments Financial instruments are classified at initial recognition as financial assets, financial liabilities or equity instruments, in accordance with the underlying economic value of the agreement and with the definitions of financial asset, financial liability or equity instrument provided in IAS 32 “Financial instruments: Presentation”. Financial instruments are recognised when the Group becomes a party bound to a contract or legal transaction in accordance with its provisions. For valuation purposes, the Group classifies financial instruments in categories of financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit or loss, separating those initially designated from those held for trading or obligatorily measured at fair value with changes in profit or loss, financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost and financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, separating equity instruments designated as such from the rest of the financial assets. The Group classifies financial assets, other than those designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss and equity instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, in accordance with the business model and the characteristics of contractual cash flows. The Group classifies financial liabilities as measured at amortised cost, except those designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss and those held for trading. The Group classifies a financial asset or liability as held for trading if: - It is acquired or incurred mainly to sell or repurchase it in the immediate future; - During initial recognition it is part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that are jointly managed and for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of short-term profit-taking; - It is a derivative, except a derivative designated as a hedging instrument and complies with conditions for effectiveness, and a derivative that is a financial guarantee contract; or - It is an obligation to deliver financial assets borrowed but not yet owned. The Group classifies a financial asset at amortised cost, if it is maintained within the scope of a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows and the contractual conditions of the financial asset generate, on specified dates, cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount of outstanding principle. The Group classifies a financial asset at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income if it is maintained within the scope of a business model whose objective is attained by obtaining contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual conditions of the financial asset generate, on specified dates, cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest. The business model is determined by core Group personnel and at a level that reflects the way in which groups of financial assets are jointly managed to attain a specific business objective. The Group's business model represents the way in which it manages its financial assets to generate cash flows. Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections throughout the instrument's life. The Group manages the assets held in the portfolio to collect the specific contractual cash flows. To determine whether the cash flows are obtained through the collection of contractual cash flows from the financial assets, the Group considers the frequency, value and sale calendar in prior years, the reasons for those sales and expectations with regard to future sales activity. Nevertheless, the sales themselves do not determine the business model and, therefore, may not be considered on their own. Instead, it is the information on past sales and future sale expectations that provides indicative data on the means of attaining the Group's stated ----- purpose with respect to the management of financial assets and, more specifically, the way in which cash flows are obtained. The Group considers the information on past sales within the context of the reasons for these sales and of the conditions that existed at that time in comparison with current ones. For these purposes, the Group considers that trade and other receivables that will be transferred to third parties and do not involve derecognition are maintained in this business model. While the purpose of the Group's business model is to hold financial assets for contractual cash flows, the Group does not hold all instruments to maturity. Thus, the Group's business model is to hold financial assets to receive contractual cash flows even if sales of those assets have taken place or are expected to take place in the future. The Group understands that it complies with this requirement, provided that the sales are due to an increase in the credit risk of the financial assets. In all other cases, at the individual and aggregate level, sales must be of minor significance, whether they are frequent or infrequent, even if they may be significant. Financial assets set in a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows and sell them, are managed to generate cash flows as contract collections and to sell them according to the Group's varying needs. In this type of business model and in order to comply with this objective, the Group's core management personnel have decided that the attainment of contractual cash flows and the sale of financial assets are essential. To achieve this objective, the Group obtains contractual cash flows and sells financial assets. Compared to the previous business model, in this business model the Group regularly makes asset sales more frequently and of greater value. The contractual cash flows that are payments of principal and interest only are consistent with a basic loan agreement. In a basic loan agreement, the most significant elements of interest are generally the consideration for the time value of money and the credit risk. Nevertheless, in an agreement of this type, the interest also includes the consideration for other risks, such as the risk of liquidity and costs, like the administrative costs of a basic loan associated with holding the financial asset for a given period. Furthermore, the interest may include a profit mark-up that may be consistent with a basic loan agreement. The Group designates a financial asset initially at fair value with changes in profit or loss) if, by doing so, it eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition of its profit or loss that would otherwise arise if the measurement of the assets or liabilities or recognition of the profit or loss is made on different bases. All other financial assets are classified at fair value with changes in profit or loss. Financial assets and liabilities arising from contingent consideration in a business combination are classified as financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit or loss. The Group initially designates a financial liability at fair value with changes in profit or loss if, by doing so, it eliminates or significantly decreases any inconsistency in the measurement or recognition of its profit or loss that would otherwise arise if the measurement of the assets or liability or the recognition of the profit or loss is made on different bases or a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and liabilities is managed, and its return is evaluated, based on fair value, in accordance with an investment or documented risk management strategy, and information is furnished internally to the Group's core management personnel about that group on that same basis. The Group classifies all other financial liabilities, except financial guarantee contracts, loan commitments below market interest rate and financial liabilities resulting from a transfer of financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition or are recorded using the continuing involvement approach, as financial liabilities at amortised cost. ----- Offset principles Financial assets and financial liabilities may only be offset when the Group currently has the legal right to offset recognised amounts and intends to either settle by offset or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. For the Group to have the currently legal right, it may not be contingent on a future event and should be legally required in the ordinary course of operations, in the event of insolvency or legally declared liquidation and in the event of non-payment. Financial assets measured at cost Investments in equity instruments for which there is insufficient information for measurement or in which a broad range of measurements exist and the related derivatives have to be settled by the delivery of those investments, are measured at cost. However, if the Group may at any time have a reliable measurement of the asset or the contract, these will be recognised at fair value at that time, recording the profits or losses in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, if the instrument is designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost Financial assets and liabilities at amortised cost are initially recognised at their fair value, plus or minus any transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit or Ioss Financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in profit or loss are initially recognised at fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase or issue are recognised as an expense when they are incurred. Initially, the fair value of a financial instrument is normally the transaction price, unless that price contains several instrument elements, in which case the Group determines its fair value. If the Group determines that an instrument's fair value differs from the transaction price, it records the difference in profit or loss, to the extent that the value is obtained by reference to a price of an identical asset or liability quoted on an active market, or was obtained by a valuation technique that only uses observable data. In all other cases, the Group recognises the difference in profit or loss, to the extent that it derives from a change in a factor that market participants would consider when determining the price of the asset or liability. Subsequent to its initial recognition, it is recognised at fair value with changes in profit or loss. Changes in fair value include the interest component and dividends. Fair value does not decrease due to the transaction costs that may be incurred through its eventual sale or disposal by any other means. Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss, the Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income. Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income statement. The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the internal rate of return at the start of the period using the fair value and contractual cash flows and deducting the reference interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, provided that the change in reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could entail significant changes to fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change linked to the credit risk. ----- Notwithstanding the above, for financial liabilities designated at fair value with changes in profit or loss, the Group recognises changes in fair value attributable to its own credit risk in other comprehensive income. Deferred amounts in other comprehensive income are not subsequently re-classified to the income statement. The Group determines the change in fair value attributable to the credit risk by initially calculating the internal rate of return at the start of the period using fair value and contractual cash flows, and deducts the reference interest rate from that rate to determine the specific rate of the credit risk component, provided that the change in the reference interest rate is not significant and that there are no other factors that could entail significant changes in the fair value. At the closing date, the Group discounts contractual cash flows at the rate determined as the sum of the reference rate on that date, plus the specific rate of the credit risk component. The difference between the fair value at year-end and the previous amount represents the change linked to the credit risk. Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income Financial assets at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are initially recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs directly attributable to the purchase. Following initial recognition, the financial assets classified in this category are measured at fair value, recognising profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the exception of profit and loss by exchange rate, as set out in the section on foreign currency transactions, and expected credit losses. The amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss as soon as financial asset derecognition takes place. However, the interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss. As indicated above, the Group has designated certain equity instruments as measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. Following initial recognition, the equity instruments are measured at fair value, recognising the profit or loss in other comprehensive income. The amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are not re-classified to profit or loss, without prejudice to their re-classification to reserves at the moment of instrument derecognition. Fair value of financial instruments The “fair value” of a financial instrument on a particular date is defined as the amount at which it could be bought or sold on that date between knowledgeable parties in an arm's length transaction. The most objective and common reference for the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be paid for it on an organised, transparent and deep market (“quoted price” or “market price”). When there is no market price for a specific financial instrument, its fair value is estimated on the basis of recent transactions involving similar instruments and, if there are none, using measurement models that have been sufficiently verified by the international financial community, bearing in mind the specific nature of the instrument to be valued and, in particular, the different types of risk associated with it. For financial reporting purposes, measurements of fair value are classified under three levels according to the extent to which the inputs applied are observable and according to how significant said inputs are for the entire measurement, as described below: - Level 1: inputs are based on quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. - Level 2: inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities (not included in Level 1), quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and techniques based on measurement models for which all the significant inputs are derived from or may be corroborated by observable market data. ----- - Level 3: inputs are generally unobservable and, in general, reflect estimates based on market assumptions to determine the price of the asset or liability. Unobservable data used in measurement models are a significant part of the fair value of the assets and liabilities. Impairment losses Since 1 January 2018, financial assets valued at amortised cost, trade receivables and other loans, in addition to financial guarantee contracts, have been subject to the recording of an impairment loss based on the expected loss of credit, either at 12 months (assets classified as investments available for sale) or over the whole lifetime (trade debtor accounts). In order to calculate the impairment loss based on the expected loss, the Group has established a model which requires estimates of future credit losses using a simplified approach. Given the nature, conditions and high credit quality of its accounts receivable and loans, the amount of impairment losses required as a result of the application of the new model to the financial asset balances is usually of little significance. Financial instrument derecognition, modifications or cancellations The Group applies financial asset derecognition criteria to part of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets, or all of a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets. Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from them are terminated or transferred, and the Group substantially transfers the risks and benefits deriving from their ownership. Furthermore, the derecognition of financial assets in those circumstances in which the Group retains the contractual rights to receive cash flows only occurs when contractual obligations that determine the payment of those flows to one or more recipients have been assumed, and the following requirements are fulfilled: - Payment of cash flows is conditioned on its prior collection; - The Group may not proceed to sell or pledge the financial asset; and - Cash flows collected on behalf of the eventual recipients are sent with significant delay, and the Group is not entitled to reinvest the cash flows. The application of this criterion does not include investments in cash or cash equivalents made by the Group during the settlement period between the collection date and delivery date stipulated with the eventual recipients, provided that any interest accrued is attributed to the eventual recipients. In those cases in which the Group transfers a financial asset in its entirety but retains the administration rights to them in exchange for a fee, an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with the rendering of that service. If the consideration received is less than the expenses to be incurred as a result of rendering the service, a liability is recognised for an amount equivalent to the obligations assumed measured at fair value. If the consideration for the service is greater than what would result from applying adequate remuneration, an asset is recognised for the administration rights. In transactions in which the total derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the financial assets obtained or the financial liabilities, including the liabilities corresponding to administration services incurred, are recorded at fair value. In transactions in which the partial derecognition of a financial asset is recorded, the book value of the complete financial asset is assigned to the part sold and to the part retained, including any assets corresponding to administration services, in proportion to the relative fair value of each of them. The total derecognition of a financial asset entails the recognition of profit or loss for the difference between its book value and the sum of the consideration received, net of transaction expenses, including any assets obtained or liabilities assumed and any deferred profit or loss in other comprehensive income, with the exception of equity instruments designated at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income. ----- The criteria for the derecognition of financial assets in transactions in which the Group neither transfers nor substantially maintains the risks and benefits inherent to ownership are based on the analysis of the degree of control maintained. In this way: - If the Group has not retained control, the financial asset is derecognised and any rights or obligations created or retained as a result of the transfer are recognised separately as assets or liabilities. - If control has been retained, the financial asset will continue to be recognised due to the Group's continued commitment in it and an associated liability is recorded. The continued commitment in the financial asset is determined by the amount of its exposure to changes in value of that asset. The asset and associated liability are measured on the basis of the rights and obligations recognised by the Group. The associated liability is recognised so that the book value of the asset and the associated liability is equal to the amortised cost of the rights and obligations retained by the Group, when the asset is measured at amortised cost, or at the fair value of the rights and obligations maintained by the Group if the asset is measured at fair value. The Group continues to recognise revenue deriving from the asset to the extent of its continued commitment and expenses deriving from the associated liability. Changes in the fair value of the asset and associated liability are consistently recognised in profit or loss or in equity, in accordance with the general recognition criteria set out above, and should not be offset. The transactions in which the Group retains substantially all the risks and benefits inherent to the ownership of a transferred financial asset are recorded through the recognition of the consideration received in liability accounts. Transaction expenses are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. The Group applies weighted average price criteria to measure and derecognise the cost of equity instruments that form part of homogeneous portfolios and that have the same rights, unless the instruments sold and their individual cost may be clearly identified. For debt instruments, it determines the cost at the individual or group level in accordance with the unit of account used to determine impairment. If the Group modifies the contractual cash flows of a financial asset, insofar as this does not entail its derecognition, the book value is re-calculated by the present value of the flows modified at the effective interest rate or effective interest rate adjusted by the original credit risk, and recognises the difference in profit or loss. The costs and fees invoiced by the Group adjust the book value of the financial asset and depreciates them during the remaining life of the modified financial asset. At 31 December 2023, the outstanding receivables transferred without recourse to financial institutions and pending maturity at that date amounted to 193,236 thousand euros (122,605 thousand euros at 31 December 2022). Interest and dividends The Group recognises interest by the effective interest method, which is the update rate that makes a financial instrument's book value equal to the estimated cash flows throughout the instrument's expected life, based on its contractual conditions and without considering expected credit losses, except for financial assets acquired or arising from incurred losses. The interest recognised on the gross book value of the financial assets, except for financial assets acquired or arising from incurred credit losses and financial assets with impaired credit. For the former, the Group recognises interest by the effective interest rate adjusted by the initial credit risk, and for the latter, the Group recognises the interest on the amortised cost. Changes in cash flow estimates are deducted at the effective interest rate or the interest rate adjusted by the original credit risk and are recognised in profit or loss. ----- Revenue for dividends from investments in equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when rights arise for the Group upon collecting them, financial profit collection is probable, and the amount may be reliably estimated. Dividends from equity instruments classified at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit or loss, unless they represent a return on the investment, in which case they are recognised in other comprehensive income. The Group recognises default interest in commercial transactions as financial income and expenses in accordance with the legal and contractual conditions stipulated. If that interest is ultimately offset or condoned, the Group recognises the transaction in accordance with its substance. The Group recognises the legal right to offset collection management costs incurred when collection is probable. The Group recognises the expense for the claim of collection management costs as indicated in the provision accounting policy. Financial liability derecognition and modification The Group derecognises a financial liability or a part thereof following compliance with the obligation contained in the financial liability contract or when it is legally released from main responsibility for the liability, either by judicial process or by the creditor. The exchange of debt instruments between the Group and the counterparty or substantial modifications to initially recognised liabilities are recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability, provided that the instruments have substantially different conditions. The Group considers the conditions to be substantially different if the present value of the cash flows deducted under the new conditions, including any fees paid net of any fees received, and using the original effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by at least 10% from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. If the exchange is recorded as a cancellation of the original financial liability, the costs or fees are recognised in profit or loss, forming part of the gain or loss on the cancellation. Otherwise, the modified cash flows are deducted at the original effective interest rate, recognising any difference with respect to the prior book value in profit or loss. Furthermore, the costs or fees adjust the book value of the financial liability and are amortised using the amortised cost method over the remaining life of the modified liability. The Group recognises the difference between the book value of the financial liability or part thereof that is cancelled or transferred to a third party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed in profit or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Consequently, transactions in other currencies are considered to be denominated in foreign currency and are recorded according to the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Gains or losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies are taken to the consolidated income statement as and when they occur.

Contingent liabilities are possible obligations of the Group arising as a result of past events which depend on whether or not one or more events beyond the Group's control occur in the future. They include the Group's current obligations whose settlement will probably not require an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits, or where a sufficiently reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation cannot be quantified. Significant provisions are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position wherever it is considered more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, but rather, where applicable, are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Provisions are measured using the best information available of the expenditures required to settle the obligation and are reviewed and adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the current best estimate. They are used to meet the specific obligations for which they were originally recognised and are fully or partially reversed when those obligations cease to exist or are reduced. The value of these provisions corresponds to the current value of the best estimate possible of the amount necessary to cancel or transfer the obligation, recording the adjustments made from updating said provisions as financial costs as they accrue. Specifically, the liabilities recorded under “Current provisions” in the accompanying consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 correspond to provisions made to cover losses which certain subsidiaries are expected to incur to comply with contracts signed prior to the end of the reporting period and whose costs will exceed the expected returns generated.

These commitments affect, primarily, group companies located in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico and India. ----- A significant portion of these commitments has been outsourced and are covered by insurance policies or pension plans with insurance companies. The Group pays fixed contributions into a fund and is obliged to make additional contributions if the fund does not have sufficient assets to pay all the employees the benefits to which it is committed.

The income tax expense is calculated as the tax payable with respect to the taxable profit for the year, after considering any changes in the year in the assets and liabilities recognised arising from temporary differences and from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards (see Note 19). The Group considers that a temporary difference exists when there is a difference between the book value of an asset or liability and its tax base. The tax base for assets and liabilities is treated as the amount attributed to it for tax purposes. A taxable temporary difference is understood to be a difference that will generate a future obligation for the Group to pay taxes to the relevant tax authorities. A deductible temporary difference is one that will generate a right for the Group to a refund or to make a lower payment to the relevant tax authorities in the future. Tax credits and deductions and tax loss carryforwards are amounts that, after the performance of the activity or generation of the profit or loss giving entitlement to them, are not used for tax purposes in the related tax return until the conditions for doing so established in tax regulations are met, provided that the Group considers it probable that they will be used in future periods. Current tax assets and liabilities are the taxes that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the related tax authorities within twelve months from the date they are recognised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are those amounts that are expected to be recoverable from or payable to the relevant tax authorities in future years. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. In this regard, a deferred tax liability is recognised for the taxable temporary differences resulting from investments in subsidiaries and associate companies, and from holdings in joint ventures, except when the Group can control the reversal of the temporary differences and they are not expected to be reversed in the foreseeable future. The consolidated companies only recognise deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences and from tax credit and tax loss carryforwards to the extent that it is probable that they will have sufficient future taxable profits against which these assets can be utilised. ----- Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability (other than in a business combination) that at the time of recognition affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. The deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are reassessed at each reporting date in order to ascertain whether they still exist, and the appropriate adjustments are made on the basis of the findings of the analyses performed. Tax uncertainties If the Group determines that it is not likely that a tax authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment or a group of uncertain tax treatments, it considers that uncertainty in determining taxable income, tax base, tax loss carryforwards, deductions or tax rates. The Group determines the effect of the uncertainty in the corporate income tax return using the expected value method, when the range of possible outcomes is highly disperse, or the most probable outcome method, when the outcome is binary or concentrated in one amount. In those cases in which the tax asset or liability calculated with these criteria exceeds the self-assessed amount, it is presented as current or non-current in the consolidated statement of financial position according to the expected recovery or settlement date and considering, where appropriate, the amount of any corresponding default interest on the liability as it accrues in the consolidated income statement. The Group records changes in events and circumstances regarding tax uncertainties as a change in estimate. The Group recognises and presents penalties in accordance with the accounting policy for provisions. Offset and classification The Group only offsets current income tax assets and liabilities if a legal right exists vis-à-vis the tax authorities and it intends to settle any resulting debts at their net amount, or realise the assets and settle the debts simultaneously. The Group only offsets deferred tax assets and liabilities if a legal offset right exists vis-à-vis the tax authorities and these assets and liabilities correspond to the same tax authority, and to the same taxpayer or to different taxpayers that seek to settle or realise the current tax assets and liabilities at their net amount or realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each one of the future tax periods in which they expect to settle or recover significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as noncurrent assets or liabilities, regardless of the anticipated date of realisation or settlement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523
441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1996,ASSETS-,1996.19,n) Recognition of income and expense-,1996.19.1,,"i) Recognition of revenue from customer contracts Revenue from customer contracts is recognised based on fulfilment of the performance obligations with those customers. Ordinary revenue represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers for an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to have a right in exchange for those goods and services. Five steps are established for the recognition of revenue: ─ Identify the customer contract/s. ─ Identify the performance obligations. ----- ─ Determine the transaction price. ─ Assign the transaction price to the various performance obligations. ─ Recognise the revenue according to fulfilment of each obligation. On the basis of this recognition model, sales of goods are recognised when the products are delivered to the customer and the customer accepts them, even if they have not yet been invoiced or, if applicable, the services have been rendered and it is reasonably assured that the corresponding receivable will be collected. Expenses are recognised on an accrual basis, immediately in the case of outlays that are not going to generate future financial profits or when they fail to comply with the necessary requirements for asset recognition. Income and expenses are taken to the consolidated income statement on an accrual basis. ❖ Revenues on sales of assets are recognised when control of the assets is transferred, which generally occurs when the assets are delivered (sent to the customer's specific location). The Group engages in the manufacture and sale of parts for the automotive sector. Although the parts are designed and manufactured exclusively for the customers and have no alternative uses for the Group, revenue is recognised when control over them is transferred and not over time, since the Group does not have an unconditional collection right for the execution performed at the close of each year. ❖ Revenues on the sale of project tools. In order to be able to manufacture the parts specifically for customers, the Group incurs costs for mould design and manufacture. Once manufactured and approved by the customer, the moulds become the property of the customer and the contracts indicate a separate price for these moulds. The Group recognises this revenue under “Net turnover” in the consolidated income statement when control of the tools is transferred to the customer, which usually occurs when they pass the corresponding technical certification or verification by the customer. The Company's Directors consider that even when the tools made for customers have no alternative use for the Group, in the event that the order were to be rescinded by the customer, the Group has no right to receive payment for performance up to that date, given that it would only have the right to collect the costs incurred and not a reasonable profit margin. For this reason, tool manufacture is recorded as a performance obligation satisfied at a specific moment. Amounts billed in advance by the Group until control of these tools is transferred are recorded as a liability under “Trade and other payables” in the consolidated statement of financial position. Moreover, any final losses expected to be sustained on tools are recognised in full when such losses become apparent, and the related provisions are recognised under this heading in the consolidated income statement. ii) Recognition of other revenue ❖ Ordinary revenue from the provision of services is recognised in line with the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. ❖ Rental income is recorded on an accrual basis, with incentive benefits and the up-front costs of the lease agreements being released on a straight-line basis. ❖ Capital grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position as deferred income when the Group has met the relevant qualifying conditions and there are, therefore, no reasonable doubts about their collection. These capital grants are taken to profit or loss, under “Capital grants and other grants taken to income” in the consolidated income statement, on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of the subsidised assets. ----- Government grants to cover or finance expenses incurred by the Group are recognised once all the conditions attaching to them have been fulfilled and will be taken to income when the financed expenses are incurred. ❖ Interest income and expense is recognised on an accrual basis using the effective interest rate method. ❖ Dividends received from other companies are recognised as income in the income statement when the consolidated companies' right to receive them arises. An expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement when there is a decrease in the future economic benefits related to a reduction of an asset, or an increase in a liability, which can be measured reliably. This means that the recognition of an expense takes place simultaneously to the recognition of the increase in a liability or the reduction of an asset. An expense is recognised immediately when a disbursement does not give rise to future economic benefits or when the requirements for recognition as an asset are not met. An expense is also recognised when a liability is incurred and no asset is recognised, as in the case of a liability relating to a guarantee.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Revenues and expenses of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement. In 2022 the business activities of the Group’s subsidiaries in Russia were discontinued. In this connection, as described in Note 6, in view of the specific monitoring of the impact of the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia on the Group’s business in Russia, for management purposes a specific geographical segment was created for the Russian market, which was effective from 1 January 2022. Subsequently, in the last months of 2022 as a result of the continuation of the military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and the fact that it was impossible for the Group’s two industrial subsidiaries in Russia (Grupo Antolin-Saint Petersburg and Antolin Avtotechnika Nizhny Nóvgorod, Ltd.) to continue operating, the Group decided to discontinue its business activities in Russia and launched a plan to sell these companies that comprise the “Russian” market segment, which were classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for 2022 (see Note 25). For this reason, the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries at 31 December 2022 were fully consolidated, but were recognised under “Non-current assets classified as held for sale” and “Liabilities associated with non-current assets classified as held for sale” in the consolidated statement of financial position, and the related income and expenses were included in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2022 separately under a single heading, “Profit/(Loss) for the year from discontinued operations, net of tax”.

In each business unit the production plants are grouped in accordance with the specific product or activity, rather than in accordance with the main activity of the company to which each plant belongs. This business unit or segment structure is focused on the production and development of each type of product and allows the operations of the businesses to be managed more efficiently. Antolin’s main business units or segments, defined taking into account the nature of the products, are as follows: “Technology Solutions” (formerly the “Lighting” segment), “Product Systems” (formerly the “Overheads & Soft Trim” and the “Doors & Cockpits” segments) and “Other”. Moreover, in the later months of 2019 approval was given to establish a new “Electronic Systems” business unit, that has been fully operational from a management perspective since 2021 (part of the “Lighting” business unit, now “Technology Solutions”). Also, effective from 1 January 2023, the subsidiary Grupo Antolin-Saltillo, S. de R.L. de C.V., which was formerly included in the “Product Systems” segment, forms part of the “Technology Solutions” segment, although the impact of this change in the information by segment from one reporting period to the other is scantly material. In addition, there is a “Corporate Unit” (forming part of “Other”) that carries out global management of certain assets and of the financing received by Antolin from third parties, as well as other minor activities. From 2022, it also manages the expenses of the Technical - Commercial Offices (TCOs). Moreover, up to and including 2022, the reported geographical segments related to “Asia-Pacific”, “Europe”, “Mercosur”, “NAFTA” and “Africa” and, moreover, in 2022, due to the continuation of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it was decided to specifically monitor the Russian market, and management information was prepared separately for the “Russia” geographical segment. However, in the last few months of 2022 Antolin decided to discontinue these activities (see Notes 3-p and 25). Also, as indicated in the preceding paragraph, a geographical segment entitled “Other” has been defined. In 2023, following a review conducted by Antolin in 2023 of the performance system by geographical segment, the “Europe”, “Mercosur” and “Africa” geographical segments now report to the geographical segment entitled “Europe & ROW (“Rest Of the World”)” and the “Asia-Pacific” and “NAFTA” geographical segments are now entitled Asia” and “North America”, respectively. ----- As a result of the changes in the segment reporting carried out in 2023, the segment information included in this note for 2022 has been adapted to make it comparable to the information for 2023 and, therefore, differs from the information reported in the consolidated financial statements for 2022.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The policies applied by the Group to test goodwill for impairment are described in Note 3-a. In this respect, at 31 December 2023, the Group carried out the corresponding analyses, evaluating the recoverable amount of the cash generating units associated with goodwill (substantially all of which corresponds to consolidated subsidiaries which are currently generating profits or are expected to do so in coming years as certain projects are launched) by reference to the fair value less costs to sell, calculated on the basis of cash flow projections that represent best estimates, covering a period of five years and with a terminal value estimated assuming a perpetuity growth rate. To determine the recoverable amounts, at the close of 2023 the Group's Directors reviewed and updated the assumptions of their forecasts relating to the activities and future results of the corresponding businesses and their impact on cash flows, and the performance of the main variables foreseen in the budgets approved for 2024 and the business plans (approved by the Board of Directors). The fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13, in which fair value measurement was classified in its entirety, was Level 3, without considering whether the costs of sale or disposable by any other means are observable. The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of this impairment test varies from country to country and ranges from 9% to 12.5%, while in 2022 this range was at levels between 8.5% and 12%. The terminal value is calculated assuming sustainable average cash flows and a forecast growth rate of 1%. The conclusion drawn by the Group from this analysis is that the recoverable value of its goodwill is greater than the book value recorded. Therefore, at 2023 and 2022 year-end, the Group had not adjusted any amount whatsoever for this goodwill. Group Management has also performed a sensitivity analysis and estimates that, even if the anticipated growth in sales is not achieved (and current levels are maintained) and/or the discount rates increase, no significant risks of impairment are foreseen. The main assumptions used were a +0.5% increase in the discount rate and a -0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The main additions to development expenditure in 2023 (which amounts to 106.6 million euros) correspond to the Chevrolet “G1Yx (Traverse)”, Porsche “Macan NF PO426 EU22 IP”, Jeep “Cherokee Panel”, Audi “Q7/Q9 Panel”, Mini “F6X EU24 IP”, Cadillac “l232 EV” PlasticP, Ford “Puma Console” and Renault “5 ECHO Panel” projects. Mass production for some of these projects began in 2023. ----- The main reductions in development expenditure in 2023 correspond principally to the derecognition of development expenditure for certain projects that had been almost fully amortised and/or had become impaired. As a result of these derecognitions, the Group recognised a net loss of 229 thousand euros in 2023 under “Profit/(Loss) on the disposal of non-current assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statement (424 thousand euros in 2022). Other intangible assets At 31 December 2023, the balance of this heading basically corresponds to certain considerations paid by the Group to customers for being awarded and securing contracts to produce and supply parts and components for these customers' projects. These incremental costs of securing orders or contracts were capitalised as it is deemed likely that profits or economic benefits will be obtained from the production and sale of the corresponding parts and components, enabling these costs to be recovered. No individual intangible assets exist that are significant in the entity's financial statements. Impairment losses Intangible assets not available for use are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with IAS 36. In this regard, at 31 December 2023, the Group analysed asset recoverability at individual project level and production plant, on the basis of the technical and financial viability of the projects under development, using the fair value less costs to sell method. In addition, at the end of every reporting period, Antolin reviews the book values of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss. Should any such signs of impairment exist, the recoverable amount of these assets is determined in order to quantify any impairment loss suffered. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit associated with these intangible assets was measured by reference to its value in use which was calculated based on best estimates of cash flows over the life of the corresponding project. The pre-tax discount rate used for the purposes of these impairment tests varies from country to country and ranges between 9% and 12.5% (for businesses in Western Europe, the US, Morocco, China, Korea, Thailand, India and Mexico), is 14% (for businesses in Brazil and South Africa), 22% (for businesses in Turkey) and 75% (for businesses in Argentina), In 2022, these rates ranged between 8.5% and 18%. In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in use. This analysis did not lead to the conclusion that there was any significant risk of impairment. The main assumptions used were a +0.5% increase in the discount rate and a -0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate. Accordingly, at 31 December 2023, the Group recorded provisions for impairment totalling 110,589 thousand euros (138,042 thousand at 31 December 2022), corresponding to a decrease in the value of the development expenditure and other intangible assets capitalised for certain projects which are currently loss-making, and for which the recoverable value is lower than their book value. Approximately 27,347 thousand euros of this amount was recognised under ""Net impairment losses on non-current assets"" in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2023 (approximately 85,025 thousand euros in 2022). In addition, impairment losses of 2,877 thousand euros were reversed in 2023 with a charge to the aforementioned balance of the consolidated income statement (no impairment provisions were reversed with a charge to this heading of the consolidated income statement for 2022). Fully amortised assets The Group's intangible assets include certain assets which had been fully amortised at 31 December 2023 and 2022. The total cost and related accumulated amortisation of these assets amounted to 313 and 277 million euros, respectively. ----- The movements under this heading and the related accumulated amortisation and impairment allowances in the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2022 were as follows: Thousands of Euros Other Development Computer Intangible Expenses Software Assets Total",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The most significant derecognitions in 2023 correspond to the retirement of machinery and other items, most of which had been depreciated in full and were not being used by the companies in their production activities. The most significant derecognitions in 2022 corresponded to the derecognition of property, plant and equipment of Chongqing Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hanzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and Antolin Spartanburg Assembly, Inc., which were excluded from the scope of consolidation during the year (see Note 2-g); and to the retirement of machinery and other items of other plants, most of which had been fully depreciated and were not being used by the companies in their production activities. As a result of these derecognitions the Group recognised a loss of 8.608 thousand euros in 2023, which was taken to income under “Gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statement (834 thousand euros in 2022). On the other hand, in 2022 the Group sold land located in Burgos, which was recognised under “Investment property” in the consolidated statement of financial position.

If so, the book value is reduced to the recoverable value and the future charges for depreciation are adjusted in proportion to their adjusted book value and the new remaining useful life if it was also necessary to re-estimate this. Any such reduction in the book value of property, plant and equipment for own use is charged to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement. |Description of Asset|Contract Term (Months)|Months Elapsed to 31/12/23|Thousands of Euros (Excluding VAT and Interest)|Col5|Col6|Col7| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| ||||Original Cost|Lease Payments Paid in Prior Years|Lease Payments Paid in 2023|Lease Payments Outstanding, Including Purchase Option| |Solar panels Printer|72 48|42 7|317 89|117 -|54 11|146 78| ||||406|117|65|224| |Description of Asset|Contract Term (Months)|Months Elapsed to 31/12/22|Thousands of Euros (Excluding VAT and Interest)|Col5|Col6|Col7| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| ||||Original Cost|Lease Payments Paid in Prior Years|Lease Payments Paid in 2022|Lease Payments Outstanding, Including Purchase Option| |Solar panels|72|30|296|70|41|185| |Period|Thousands of Euros| |---|---| |Less than one year Between one and five years More than five years|3,689 7,788 -| ||11,477| ----- Similarly, whenever there are signs that the value of an impaired asset has recovered, the consolidated companies reverse impairment losses recognised in prior years. The increased book value may not exceed the book value that would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset. In this regard, at 31 December 2023 the Group's consolidated companies tested for signs of impairment of their property, plant and equipment, of their cash-generating units (productive plant) and at the level of each project for development expenses to which those assets are assigned and at production plant level, and when identified, they proceeded to quantify the related recoverable amount. Where the asset does not itself generate cash inflows that are independent of those from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value (less costs to sell) and its value in use. In calculating value in use at 31 December 2023, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. These future cash flows are derived from the forecasts made by Antolin for each cash generating unit for a period of five years (using assumptions concerning changes in sale prices, costs and volumes based on experience and future expectations in accordance with the currently approved strategic plan and the budget for the coming year), with a residual value calculated using a growth rate of 1%. The pre-tax discount rate used for the purposes of these impairment tests varies from country to country and ranges between 9% and 12.5% (for businesses in Western Europe, the US, Morocco, China, Korea, Thailand, India and Mexico), is 14% (for businesses in Brazil and South Africa), 22% (for businesses in Turkey) and 75% (for businesses in Argentina), In 2022, these rates ranged between 8.5% and 18%. In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in use. This analysis did not lead to the conclusion that there was any risk of impairment. The main assumptions used were a +0.5 basis points increase in the discount rate and a -0.5 basis points reduction in the perpetuity growth rate. Based on this analysis, at 31 December 2023 the Group recognise impairment losses on property, plant and equipment totalling 64,202 thousand euros (of which a net amount of 3,987 thousand euros were recognised in 2023, 59,547 thousand euros in 2022 and the rest in years prior to 2022). These losses basically correspond to the loss of property, plant and equipment at the plants owned by Grupo Antolin-Kentucky, Inc., Grupo AntolinMichigan, Inc., Antolin Liban, s.r.o., Grupo Antolin Bohemia, a.s. and Grupo Antolin Bratislava, s.r.o. for projects that are currently generating losses or have done so in the past and whose recoverable amount is below their book value (at 31 December 2022, the Group had recognised impairment losses in the amount of 62,683 thousand euros).",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

This heading in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 and 2021 includes the following reserves: _Legal reserve-_ The revised text of the Spanish Corporate Enterprise Act stipulates that 10% of the net profits of the year must be appropriated to the legal reserve until it reaches at least 20% of share capital. At 31 December 2022 and 2021, the legal reserve amounted to 7,494 thousand euros (equivalent to 20% of the Parent's share capital). The legal reserve can be used to increase capital provided that the remaining reserve balance does not fall below 10% of the increased share capital amount. Otherwise, whereas the legal reserve does not exceed 20% of share capital, it can only be used to offset losses, provided that sufficient other reserves are not available for this purpose. _Capitalisation reserve-_ The Parent's “Capitalisation reserve” at 31 December 2022 and 2021 amounted to 5,800 thousand euros. This reserve was established in compliance with Law 27/2014, of 27 November, on Corporate Income Tax and is restricted for 5 years from the end of the year to which the reduction in the final taxable income for corporate income tax corresponds _(consequently, 2,000 thousand euros are restricted until 31 December 2022 and 2,000 _thousand euros are restricted until 31 December 2021, while 1,800 thousand euros are no longer restricted as of 31 December 2020). The amount matches that by which the final tax base applied was reduced for this item in the_ Spanish consolidated tax group's corporate income tax return for 2015, 2016 and 2017. _Other reserves-_ The balance under this heading at 31 December 2022 includes losses carried forward from previous financial years _(258,057 thousand euros) and other unrestricted reserves of the Parent._ -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

441,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,1996,ASSETS-,1996.92,"Syndicated Loan Facility, and multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility-",1996.92.1,,"On 13 March 2014, the Parent signed a “Senior Facilities Agreement” with major Spanish and international financial institutions under which Antolin obtained financing by means of a 200-million-euro syndicated Loan Facility, and a multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility with a 200-million-euro limit. Subsequently, in June 2015 a 200-millioneuro extension to the syndicated Loan Facility was entered into, increasing the capital of said loan to 400 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent by 31 December 2015. On 26 October 2016, Antolin signed a novation of the “Senior Facilities Agreement”, amending the repayment schedule, extending the final maturity date of the contract to 2021 (originally this was 2020), and modifying the interest rate (Euribor plus a market spread) thereby reducing the Group’s finance costs. Also, on 27 April 2018, a change to the “Senior Facilities Agreement” (“Amendment and Restatement Agreement”) was signed, increasing the syndicated loan by 50 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent in 2018. The amount of the loan was 419,204 thousand euros and it was divided into three tranches. In this modification of the loan a new financial institution became a lender (HSBC Bank plc), the final maturity of the contract was extended until 2023, and the repayment schedule was changed as was the interest rate, reducing the cost of this financing. ----- Additionally, on 3 June 2020 a new amendment to this financing agreement was executed, which allowed Antolin the possibility of additional financing for an aggregate amount of up to 200 million euros. In 2021 the Parent completed a process to refinance the “Senior Facilities Agreement” (“Amendment and Restatement Agreement”) in order to extend the repayment schedule. In this loan amendment a new financial institution became a lender (Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO)), the final maturity of the agreement was extended to 2026 and the repayment schedule and applicable interest rate were modified. In accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, Antolin checked that the present value of the cash flows deducted under the new conditions, using the original effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by less than 10% from the present discounted value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. Antolin calculated the differential amount of the present value of the future contractual cash flows discounted at the debt's original effective interest rate with respect to the amortised cost recorded without reaching a significant quantity for recognition in the consolidated financial statements for 2021. In relation to the multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, with the inclusion of the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) as a lender, it was agreed to reduce the total available amount from 200 million euros (initially granted) to 193,550 thousand euros, of which 4,450 thousand euros has been set up as a bank guarantee facility and 189,100 thousand euros are directly linked to the credit facility. Lastly, in 2022 a new amendment to this financing agreement was executed, under which certain adjustments were included in relation to the financial ratios which the Group is required to achieve, taking into account the restructuring costs and the synergies included in the 2023-2026 Business plan. In 2023 and 2022, the Group repaid 15,727 and 16,127 thousand euros, respectively, of these financing agreements. The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2023 and 2022 was 353,860 and 369,587 thousand euros, respectively, since at those dates the Parent had not drawn down any amount against the multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility.

Furthermore, the following events will trigger full or partial early repayment of these loans: - Subject to certain exceptions and amounts, the disposal of specific asset categories, the receipt of indemnities from insurance companies or the flotation of the Parent (with no change of control of the Group). - In the event of a change of control in the Group, any of the financial institutions may decide to leave the financing arrangements in place or may request early repayment of the proportional part of the loan corresponding to said institution.

Loan guarantees These loans are backed by an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee from a significant number of the companies forming the Group, although the guarantees provided by some subsidiaries (specifically certain Portuguese, Czech and German companies) are limited to amounts established by the applicable local legislation. In order to comply with the obligations related to these loans, Antolin has given a commitment to each of the subsidiaries in which it holds at least 90% of the share capital that it will become a guarantor if the following circumstances arise: its EBITDA for the year represents at least 2.5% of the Group's EBITDA and exceeds 5 million euros. In addition, liens have been established on the share capital of the Parent (see Note 13). Early repayment The Senior Facilities Agreement under which these loans were granted includes clauses specifying that the following events will trigger their full early repayment: - Failure to repay the principal or pay the interest on the loans as and when they fall due. - Failure of the Group to achieve the financial ratios set in the agreement under which these loans were granted or to remedy said failure within 20 days of the issue of the “ratio compliance certificate” in which they are detailed. - Failure to comply with other obligations established in the loan agreement (false disclosures, failure to provide information, etc.) without rectifying said failure within a determined period. - Failure to pay other borrowings falling due, provided certain circumstances are met, or the insolvency of the Parent, a material subsidiary, or the shareholders. - A change in the ownership of the shares of the Parent, or the closure of businesses, expropriation, lawsuits and legal claims, the seizure of or embargoes on assets, material changes and any other circumstances which have a material adverse effect on the Group. The loans will also be repayable if the Group's auditors issue a disclaimer of opinion, or an adverse or qualified opinion. At 31 December 2023, the Parent's Directors considered that all the clauses and obligations set out in the financing agreement and their subsequent amendments had been fulfilled, and that no grounds for early maturity or partial or total early repayment had occurred. They also consider that all conditions will be met in the following 12 months from the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements. Other obligations and commitments The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain obligations and commitments limiting the Group's capacity to perform certain operations during the life of the loans, including the following: - Limits on obtaining additional financing, the constitution of charges or guarantees against its assets, and the granting of guarantees or sureties to third parties. - Limits on the sale, cession, transfer or other forms of disposal of its assets. - Limits on the acquisition of companies or businesses. - Limits on the distribution of dividends by the Parent (see Note 13). -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

In this regard, on 17 April 2019 the Spanish consolidated tax group to which the Parent and the majority of the Spanish consolidated subsidiaries belong filed supplementary corporate income tax returns for 2016 and 2017. Recently, on 18 January 2024, the Spanish Constitutional Court unanimously declared unconstitutional and null and void the provisions envisaged in Additional Provision Fifteen and paragraph 3 of Additional Provision Sixteen of Spanish Corporate Income Tax Law 27/2014, of 27 November, as amended by paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 3.1 of Royal Decree-Law 3/2016, of 2 December, adopting tax measures aimed at consolidating public finances and other urgent social measures. Specifically, it declared unconstitutional the introduction of stricter limitations on the offsetting of tax loss carryforwards, the ex-novo introduction of a limitation on the application of double taxation tax credits, and the requirement to automatically include in the corporate income tax base the impairment losses on ownership interests that would have been deducted in prior years. In this regard, on 8 June 2021 and 17 November 2021, Avot Inversiones, S.L., as the head of the consolidated tax group in Spain, submitted requests to rectify the corporate income tax returns filed for years 2016 to 2019 and 2020, respectively. Although the Spanish consolidated tax group’s corporate income tax returns for 2016 to 2022 will be affected by this ruling, at present it is not yet possible to determine with any certainty what the specific effects will be for Antolin, considering in any event that the rectification requests should be accepted in full given that the provisions on which the rectification requests are based are perfectly valid. Due to various factors concerning uncertainty which prevent these effects from being determined from a quantitative point of view and make it impossible to predict when they may be determined or when they will arise, no related deferred assets have been recognised. Consequently, in Spain at 31 December 2023, the Group had 2020 through 2023, inclusive, open for inspection by the tax authorities for all applicable taxes as well as 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for Corporate Income Tax as a result of the rectification and amended returns filed. The Parent's Directors believe that the settlements of those taxes have been properly executed and, therefore, even if differences were to arise in the interpretation of the regulations governing the tax treatment of its operations, such liabilities as could arise as a result of inspections in certain subsidiaries in relation to the remaining years open for inspection would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements for 2023. |Col1|Thousands of Euros|Col3| |---|---|---| ||31/12/23|31/12/22| |Deductions for research and development activities Other deductions|45,182 (a) 4,870|41,888 (b) 2,864| ||50,052|44,752| -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

From 2024 onwards the Group must assume a payment corresponding to a top-up tax that will be levied on the profits obtained in any jurisdiction in which it operates in which the effective tax rate, calculated at a jurisdictional level, is lower than the minimum tax rate of 15%. Pillar Two legislation is currently in the process of being approved in Spain and is expected to come into force at the beginning of 2024 and will be applicable to Antolin for the first time in the reporting period commencing 1 January 2024 and, therefore, at 31 December 2023, the Group's corporate income tax expense for 2023 and, accordingly, its consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2023 are not affected by the Pillar Two rules. Also, the Group applies the exception for recognising and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two corporate income taxes provided for in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023 (see Note 2-b). Adaptation to the top-up tax Antolin has explicitly undertaken to apply the OECD Pillar Two Model Rules. The Group is aligned with the principles and actions advocated by the OECD and is working on an analysis of the impact of the new Pillar Two in order to establish a compliance and control and management system that will permit it to adapt to the new rules in due time and form. In this regard, although the Group's analysis is still in progress, taking into account the existing regulatory framework, an estimated calculation of the top-up tax arising from the application of Pillar Two was performed on the basis of the most recent tax returns, the country-by-country report and the financial statements of the constituent entities of the Group, and based on this calculation and subject to unforeseen events, the application of the Model Rules is not expected to have a significant effect on equity, since in the jurisdictions in which the Group operates the effective tax rate is at least 15% and/or the Group has sufficient employees and tangible assets to trigger the substance-based income exclusion. In this connection, it should be noted that the jurisdictions in which Antolin operates in which the effective tax rate is below 15% are either not material jurisdictions and, therefore, the potential top-up tax that may arise is not material or, although the average effective tax rate is below 15%, the Group considers that the new tax will not have a material impact on the consolidated income statement applying the specific adjustments provided for in the Pillar Two Model Rules and the Safe Harbour rules,",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The negative economic impact of the war in Ukraine is coupled with current risks in relation to supplies with regard to a lesser, but still present, shortage of semi-conductors, an increase in gas and electricity prices, the generalised inflation associated with the rest of the production factors and the interest rate hikes in Europe and the United ----- vehicle production has been adversely affected. The indirect impacts of the Russian invasion have been more pronounced in Europe, but could spread to other markets if the conflict intensifies. Original equipment manufacturers (OEM) based in Russia have suspended their production activities and prospects in terms of resuming their operations in the short term continue to be poor. As regards Grupo Antolin, the direct impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not considered significant since the joint sales of our two factories in Russia (St Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod) represented 0.17% and 0.5% of the total turnover in 2022 and 2021, respectively. In this regard, and given the uncertainty surrounding the realisation of the Group's assets in Russia, in 2022 the Group decided to discontinue its operations in that country and initiate a process for the sale of the related business which was completed in March 2023 (see Note 26).

Grupo Antolin has known how to address the various outbreaks of the pandemic with flexibility and with the experience and knowledged gained in previous years.

This protocol includes, among other issues, measures that affect organisation within the company, and higiene measures prior to going to the office and on route to work, measures for entering and leaving the facilities, as well as additional measures in relation to meetings and restrictions. The main aim of the aforementioned protocol is to safeguard people’s health and safety and to guarantee the continuity of the business and liquidity. At the date of authorisation for issue of these consolidated financial statements, the Group did not consider that the effects arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which may still continue to arise at global level, will have a significant impact in 2023 due to the increase in the vaccinated population, the effectiveness of the vaccines and medical treatments that have been used and the experience gained in previous years.

Antolin incorporates issues related to climate change and environmental issues in its risk catalogue, explicitly in four of the risks included in the corporate catalogue: ""Environmental risk"", ""Risk of non-compliance with environmental legislation"", ""Risk of incidents in the environmental management of production"" (including waste management) and ""Risk of climate change"". “Environmental risk” relates to the absence or inadequate definition of a business contingency plan that covers both preventive management and recovery of activity in situations caused by serious accidents and/or natural disasters. In short, it takes into consideration extreme weather events that may significantly affect its operations and facilities. Both the risk of ""Non-compliance with environmental legislation"" and the risk of ""Incidents in the environmental management of production"" (understood as the occurrence of accidents with environmental impact) refer to the penalties that may be incurred as well as the reputational damage derived from such incidents. In the case of ""Climate Change"" risk, reference is made to the negative impact of climate change and its consequences in relation to meeting the Company's strategic objectives. Antolin adopts and applies the main conventions and guidelines established in the Global Compact (Principles 7, 8 and 9) and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP Water Disclosure Project) and has resolved to progressively reduce its carbon emissions in order to achieve neutrality by 2040 in its own operations, with an intermediate 75% (previously established at 30%) reduction by 2028, and wishes to extend this environmental commitment to its entire supply chain in order to achieve total carbon neutrality by 2050. The activities of Grupo Antolin are also exposed to other risks that could impact on the economic growth or the business activity of the markets in which it operates. The Group's global risk management programme is also focused on the uncertainty of these other risks and seeks to minimise any adverse effects on the Group's profitability.

If we add to this factor the continuing shortage of microchips, the persistence of bottlenecks in supply chains, the sporadic shutdowns of activity due to Covid-19 in some cities in China, the generalised inflation linked to the rest of the production factors and the interest rate hikes in Europe and the United States, the negative effect on the pace of economic growth is more than notable compared to the expectations that were created at the beginning of the year. The automotive sector has been significantly affected by the impact of all these factors, especially in the first half of 2022, and improved progressively in the second half of 2022, and has recorded finally an increase in its production volumes in 2022 of 6% compared to 2021. Thus, the number of vehicles manufactured in 2022 amounted to 82 million units compared to the 77 million units manufactured in 2021. In this context, Grupo Antolin’s revenue, including the sale of tools on behalf of customers, increased by 9.7% on the figure for 2021, and it reported a loss attributable to the Parent _(225.6 million euros) and a 5.5% increase in EBITDA _(operating profit from ordinary continuing operations + depreciation and amortisation _charge). In view of this situation, and as a result of the existence in the Syndicated Loan and Revolving Credit_ Facility agreement of clauses in which, among other factors, the failure of the Group to achieve the financial ratios established in said financing agreement would be considered to be grounds for the early maturity of the full amount of the financing, Grupo Antolin has continued monitoring the situation and also periodically estimates the value of the aforementioned ratios. The latest estimates made do not expect the Group to fail to achieve these ratios in the twelve months following the date of authorisation for issue of these financial statements. In addition, Grupo Antolin monitors all the variables that can affect the aforementioned ratios and adopts the appropriate measure to enable it to mitigate and eliminate the possibility of failing to achieve the established ratios. Also, the implementation of the GOA program that commenced in 2022 will speed up the transformation of Grupo Antolin into a more profitable, more efficient, more innovative and more customeroriented company; this, together with the far-reaching diversification of the Group’s business model in geographical, customer and product terms, allows it to face up to all of these issues with a large measure of serenity and confidence. In addition, the Group is focused on harnessing the business potential offered by future mobility. With this objective, the new strategic plan prioritises and continues the lines of work initiated in recent years, developing the Smart Integrator strategy, on which the Group has been working for some time and which is based on the development of more complex, higher added-value systems that offer new functionalities including new technology, electronics and lighting solutions. The Parent’s directors consider that the economic and financial measures carried out, as well as the cornerstones on which its strategic plan is based, will contribute positively to making the Group stronger, more efficient and more competitive, and enable it to continue to grow and meet its profitability targets.

In accordance with IFRS 3, goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment _(i.e. a reduction in the _recoverable amount of the “Goodwill” to below its book value) at the end of each reporting period and any_ i i t i h d t “N t i i t l t t ” i th lid t d i ----- The recoverable value of goodwill and of other intangible and tangible assets is measured as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, understood to be the present value of expected future cash flows from the investment. The Group's Directors apply the following methodology to test goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment (see Notes 7 and 8): - The recoverable amounts are calculated for each cash generating unit (CGU). The goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to each one of the cash generating units or groups of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination synergies. Each unit or group of units to which goodwill is assigned represents the lowest level in the entity at which goodwill is controlled for internal management purposes. Note 7. For the purpose of intangible and tangible fixed assets, cash generating units are associated with the projects. - The Group's Directors regularly prepare a business plan for each cash generating unit, broken down by market and activity, covering a period of at least five years. An annual budget is also prepared each year for the following financial year. The main components of said plan and budget are: - Results forecasts. - Investment and working capital forecasts. - Other variables influencing the calculation of recoverable value are: - The discount rate to be applied, i.e. the weighted average cost of capital. The main factors affecting this are the cost of the liabilities and specific risks related to the assets. - The growth rate applied to cash flows to extrapolate them beyond the period covered by budgets and forecasts, up to five financial years. Forecasts are prepared on the basis of past experience and the best available estimates in line with externally obtained information. The business plans thus prepared are reviewed and approved by the Parent's Board of Directors. If an impairment loss must be recognised for a cash generating unit to which all or part of the goodwill has been assigned, first the book value of the goodwill corresponding to the cash generating unit will be reduced. If the impairment loss exceeds the amount of goodwill, the rest of assets allocated to the CGU are then written down, in proportion to their book values, up to the limit of the higher of the following: fair value less cost to sell, value in use and zero. At 2022 and 2021 year-end no goodwill impairment was recorded. “Goodwill” recognised on the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022 corresponds basically to the consolidated subsidiaries and plants acquired in 2015 from the international Magna Automotive group and other companies forming part of the “Lighting” business acquired from the “CML Innovative Technologies” group in 2012, and other non-material goodwill recognised (see Note 7).",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Development expenses incurred using the Group's own resources are recorded (by type) in the consolidated income statement, while development expenses for projects which meet the above conditions are debited against “Development expenses” in the consolidated statement of financial position and credited to “Own work capitalised” in the consolidated income statement. Capitalised development expenses are in practically all cases amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the projects as from the date the related projects are completed. Development expenses relate mainly to the costs incurred in this connection by the consolidated subsidiary Grupo Antolin-Ingeniería, S.A.U. and the Group's other research and development centres. Research expenses are taken directly to income in the financial year in which they are incurred. _Software and other intangible assets-_ Other intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised accordingly, using criteria similar to those used for property, plant and equipment. Specifically, “Computer software” is written off over a period of 5 years as from when it starts to be used. When accounting for the business combination involving the companies and plants acquired in 2015 from the international Magna Automotive group, “Customer relations” in the automobile industry was identified as an intangible asset, on the basis that one of the Group's aims in carrying out said operation was to develop new services and products in this sector. This intangible asset has been measured at its fair value. The remaining useful life of this intangible asset was estimated between 2 and 7 years, over which period it will be amortised. The annual amortisation expense for intangible assets with finite useful lives is charged to “Depreciation and amortisation expenses” on the consolidated income statement. _Impairment losses-_ The consolidated companies recognise any impairment loss in the book value of the assets associated with the CGUs with a charge to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement.

Property, plant and equipment are stated in the consolidated statement of financial position at their acquisition or production cost, adjusted or revalued, whenever applicable, in accordance with applicable legal provisions, or at their “fair value” as determined by independent experts on the date of transition to “IFRS-EU” _(1 January 2006), the amount of which is recorded as an attributed cost, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. The cost of extensions, modernisations or improvements that increase the productivity, capacity or efficiency or prolong the useful life of an asset are capitalised as an increase in the cost of said asset. Borrowing costs directly attributable to building or developing property, plant and equipment that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are added to the cost of those assets ----- specifically for building said assets, the amount of the interest and other finance costs capitalised reflects the actual costs incurred during the period, less income earned from temporarily reinvesting the financing that has not yet been invested in the qualifying assets. Where the financing received is of a general nature, the amount of interest capitalised is calculated using a rate based on the weighted average of the interest costs applicable to the average unrepaid financing in the year excluding financing for specific purposes. However, the capitalisation of interest is suspended during the periods in which the construction work is at a standstill, provided that such periods are not particularly long. In 2022 and 2021, the Group had not capitalised any finance costs as an increase in the book value of “Property, plant and equipment”. Upkeep and maintenance expenses for property, plant and equipment for own use are expensed in the year they are incurred. The Group transfers PP&E under construction to PP&E used in operations when the assets in question become operational, from which time depreciation is charged. Property, plant and equipment used in operations are depreciated on a straight-line basis, based on the acquisition or production cost of the assets or their restated value, less their residual value. The land on which buildings and other constructions are located is deemed to have an indefinite lifespan and is therefore not subject to depreciation.

The income and expenses and results of the companies disposed of during the period between the start of 2022 and the date on which these companies were disposed of were of little significance, and the net changes in its assets and liabilities over the same period were also immaterial. As a result of the sale of these companies, as well as the dissolution and liquidation of Gestión Industrial de Sonora, S.A. de C.V., the Group incurred a net loss of 324 thousand euros, which is recognised under “Gains or losses on the loss of control of consolidated equity interests” in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2022. The effect of the additions of companies to the scope of consolidation in 2022 on the Group’s consolidated financial statements has not been significant. _2021:_ The changes to the Group's scope of consolidation in 2021 were as follows: - The incorporation of Antolin St. Clair, LLC., in the United States of America, by contribution of the productive business unit in St. Clair, formerly the property of the subsidiary Antolin Interiors USA, Inc., in which the Group holds a 100% interest. - The incorporation of Shanghai Antolin Naen Automotive Electronics Co., Ltd., a “joint venture'” created with NAEN Auto Technology which specialises in the electronics of keyless vehicle entry and ignition systems, in which the Group holds a 51% interest. - The incorporation of Hefei Antolin Auto Parts Co., Ltd., a “joint venture'"" created with Changshu Automotive Trim Co., Ltd., in which the Group, through its subsidiary Changshu Antolin Automotive Interiors Co., Ltd. holds an effective 60% interest in its share capital. - In 2021 the dissolution and liquidation took place of the subsidiaries Grupo Antolin-Holland, B.V. and Mexican Door Company, S. de R.L. de C.V. These changes have had a very insignificant impact on the 2021 consolidated annual financial statements. ----- **(3)** **ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND MEASUREMENT CRITERIA** In preparing the consolidated annual financial statements for 2022 the following accounting principles and policies and measurement criteria were applied:",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

As indicated in Note 2-g, in July 2022 the Group acquired a 51% stake in the share capital of Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan) Automotive Trim Co., Ltd. for a price of practically zero. As a result of this operation, the Group now owns 100% of the share capital of this company (at 31 December 2021 it owned 49%), and now controls it. The assets and liabilities of Dongfeng Antolin (Wuhan) Automotive Trim Co., Ltd. recognised at the acquisition date, which have been measured at fair value, and their amounts, were not significant with respect to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities in these business combinations do not significantly differ from the values at which they were carried in the books of the mentioned company when the business was combined. The contingent liabilities of this company have been guaranteed by the seller. As a consequence of the recognition of the aforementioned assets and liabilities, goodwill has been generated in amounts of 160 thousand euros, recorded under the consolidated statement of financial position heading “Intangible assets-Goodwill” (see Note 7). No business combinations were carried out in 2021. **(6)** **INFORMATION BY SEGMENT** The information by segment used by Group Management for management purposes is structured on the basis of the Group's different business units, and also by geographical segments. In each business unit the production plants are grouped in accordance with the specific product or activity, rather than in accordance with the main activity of the company to which each plant belongs. This business unit or segment structure is focused on the production and development of each type of product and will allow the operations of the businesses to be managed more efficiently. The main business units or segments of Grupo Antolin are the following three, defined taking into account the nature of the products: “Overheads & Soft Trim”, “Doors & Cockpits” and “Lighting”. Moreover, approval was given in the later months of 2019 to establish a new “Electronic Systems” business unit, that has been fully operational since 2021 from a management perspective _(part of the “Lighting” business unit)._ Until 2021 the “Doors & Hard Trim” and “Cockpits & Consoles” segments were managed and presented separately, and in 2022 they were included in a single business unit. Moreover, in 2022 the subsidiaries Grupo Antolin-Dapsa, S.A.U. and Grupo Antolin-Plasbur, S.A.U. were taken from the other segments in which they were included until 2021 to the “Lighting” segment. |Col1|Euros|Col3| |---|---|---| ||2022|2021| |Distributable profit/(loss): Profit/(loss) for the year Allocation: Prior years' losses|(57,947.824,04)|(89,666.590,42)| ||(57,947.824,04|(89,666.590,42)| ----- In addition, in order to prevent the distortion of the analysis of the performance of the industrial and geographical segments, a segment entitled “Other” has been defined, which includes the “Corporate Unit” that carries out the _global management of certain assets and the financing received by the Group from third parties, as well as other minor activities, the consolidation adjustments and, from 2022, the Technical-Commercial Offices (TCOs) expenses._ Also, the geographical segments defined by the group are: “Asia-Pacific”, “Europe”, “Mercosur”, “NAFTA” and “Africa”. In 2022, in view of the continuation of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, a decision was taken to specifically monitor the Russian market and separate management information was prepared on the “Russia” segment. Subsequently, in the last months of 2022, a decision was taken to discontinue the business activities of this geographical segment. Also, as indicated in the previous paragraph, a new geographical segment entitled “Other” was defined. As a result of the changes in the segment reporting carried out in 2022, the segment information included in this Note was adapted in 2021 to make it comparable to the information for 2022 and, therefore, it differs from the information reported in the consolidated financial statements for 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

The policies applied by the Group to test for impairment to goodwill are described in Note 3-b. In this respect, at 31 December 2022 the Group carried out the corresponding analyses, evaluating the recoverable amount of the cash generating units associated with goodwill _(substantially all of which corresponds to _consolidated subsidiaries which are currently generating profits or are expected to do so in coming years as certain projects are launched) by reference to the fair value less costs to sell, calculated on the basis of cash flow_ projections that represent best estimates, covering a period of five years and with a terminal value estimated assuming a perpetuity growth rate. To determine the recoverable amounts, at the close of 2022 the Group's Directors reviewed and updated the assumptions relating to the future activities and forecast results of the corresponding businesses and their impact on cash flows, and the performance of the main variables foreseen in the budgets approved for 2023 and the business plans _(approved by the Board of Directors)._ The fair value hierarchy according to IFRS 13, in which fair value measurement was classified in its entirety, was Level 3, without considering whether the costs of sale or disposable by any other means are observable. The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of this impairment test varies from country to country and ranges from 8.50% (for some businesses in Western Europe and the US) to 18% (for businesses in Argentina, Russia _and Turkey), while in 2021 this range was at levels between 7.5% and 12%. The terminal value is calculated_ assuming sustainable average cash flows and a forecast growth rate of 1%. The conclusion drawn by the Group from this analysis is that the recoverable value of its goodwill is greater than the book value recorded. |Col1|Thousands of Euros| |---|---| |Balance at 31 December 2020|90,046| |Impairment Translation differences and other|- -| |Balance at 31 December 2021|90,046| |Additions (Note 5) Impairment Translation differences and other|160 - -| |Balance at 31 December 2022|90,206| |Cash Generating Unit or Entity|Thousands of Euros|Col3| |---|---|---| ||31/12/22|31/12/21| |“Lighting” business unit Antolin Interiors Mexico, S.A. de C.V.

The main additions of development expenses in 2022 correspond to the Renault “XHN Kadjar EUR 21 Panel+Plastic”, “Human Horizons IP”, BMW “U06 Lighting”, Mini “F56 Lighting” Renault “Kadjar Headliner” and Renault “BCB Headliner” projects. Mass production for some of these projects began in 2022. Development costs derecognised in 2022 correspond principally to development costs for certain projects which were almost fully amortised and/or impaired. As a result of these derecognitions, the Group recognised a net loss of 424 thousand euros in 2022 under “Profit/(loss) on the disposal of non-current assets” in the attached consolidated income statement (2.6 million euros in 2021). _Other intangible assets-_ At 31 December 2022, the balance of this heading basically corresponds to customer relations recognised in 2015 in the business combination of the interior components business unit of the international Magna Automotive Group, which will be amortised over periods of between 2 and 7 years; and to certain considerations paid by the Group to customers for being awarded and securing contracts to produce and supply parts and components for these customers' projects. These incremental costs of securing orders or contracts were capitalised as it is deemed likely that profits or economic benefits will be obtained from the production and sale of the corresponding parts and components, enabling these costs to be recovered. No individual intangible assets exist that are significant in the entity's financial statements. _Impairment losses-_ Intangible assets not available for use are subject to annual impairment tests in keeping with IAS 36. In this regard, at 31 December 2022, the Group analysed asset recoverability at individual project level and production plant, on the basis of the technical and financial viability of the projects under development, using the fair value less costs to sell method. In addition, at the end of every reporting period, the Group reviews the book values of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered any impairment loss. Should any such signs of impairment exist, the recoverable amount of these assets is determined in order to quantify any impairment loss suffered. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit associated with these intangible assets was measured by reference to its value in use which was calculated based on best estimates of cash flows over the life of the corresponding project. The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of these impairment tests is between 8.5% and 18%, depending on the country. In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in use. This analysis did lead to the conclusion that there was no significant risk of impairment. The main assumptions used were a 0.5% increase in the discount rate and a 0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate. The Group estimates a 10% increase in turnover with respect to 2022 due to the recovery of the activity in Nafta, and to the positive evolution of the Chinese market, a higher margin on sales of between 7.5%- and 8%, as a result of the improvement initiatives applied, optimisation programmes implemented and the decrease in fixed and variable costs arising from the digitalisation and standardisation efficiency programme implemented in recent years. Accordingly, at 31 December 2022, the Group recorded provisions for impairment totalling 138,042 thousand euros _(76,351 thousand at 31 December 2021), corresponding to a decrease in the value of the development expenses and other intangible assets for certain projects which are currently loss-making, and for which the recoverable value is lower than their book value. Approximately 85,025 thousand euros of this amount was recognised under ""Net impairment loss on non-current assets"" in the accompanying consolidated income statement for 2022 _(approximately 16,332 thousand euros in 2021). No impairment provisions were reversed against this heading of the consolidated income statement for 2022 (328 thousand euros in 2021) ----- _Fully amortised assets-_ The Group's intangible assets include certain assets which had been fully amortised at 31 December 2022 and 2021.

The most significant derecognitions in 2022 correspond to the derecognition of property, plant and equipment of Chongqing Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd., Hanzhou Antolin Tuopu Overhead System Co., Ltd. and Antolin Spartanburg Assembly, Inc., which were excluded from the scope of consolidation during the period (see Note 3); and to the recognition of retirements of machinery and other items of other plants, most of which had been fully depreciated and were not in productive use by the companies. The Group recognised a scantly material losses in 2022 (834 thousand euros) as a result of these retirements, which was taken to income under “Gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets” in the accompanying consolidated income statement _(in 2021 gains on disposal and derecognition of property, plant and equipment totalled 3.5 _million euros)._ On the other hand, in 2022 the Group sold land located in Burgos, which was recognised under “Investment property” in the consolidated statement of financial position. On this transaction, the Group obtained a loss of approximately 0.6 million euros, which was taken to income under ""Gains or losses on disposals of non-current assets"" in the accompanying consolidated income statement. The most significant derecognitions in 2021 corresponded to removals and disposals recorded in relation to machinery and other items of plant basically located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Czech Republic and Austria. Also, in 2021 the Group sold a building located in Almussafes (Valencia), that also was recognized under “Investment property”.

If so, the book value is reduced to the recoverable value and the future charges for depreciation are adjusted in proportion to their adjusted book value and the new remaining useful life if it was also necessary to re-estimate this. Any such reduction in the book value of property, plant and equipment for own use is charged to “Net impairment losses on non-current assets” in the consolidated income statement. Similarly, whenever there are signs that the value of an impaired asset has recovered, the consolidated companies reverse impairment losses recognised in prior years. The increased book value may not exceed the book value that would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset. In this regard, at 31 December 2022 the Group's consolidated companies tested for signs of impairment of their property, plant and equipment, at the level of each project to which those assets and at production plant level are assigned and if impairment was identified, they proceeded to quantify their recoverable amount. Where the asset does not itself generate cash inflows that are independent of those from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value (less sale costs) and its value in use. In calculating value in use at 31 December 2022, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. These future cash flows are derived from the forecasts made by the Group for each cash generating unit for a period of five years (using assumptions _concerning changes in sale prices, costs and volumes based on experience and future expectations in accordance with the currently approved strategic plan and the budget for the coming year), with a residual value calculated_ using a growth rate of 1%. The discount rate before tax used for the purposes of these impairment tests is between 8.5% and 18%, depending on the country. In addition, Group management performed a sensitivity analysis, modifying the discount rate and the residual growth rate, in order to assess the impact that this modification could have on the recoverability of the values in use. This analysis did not lead to the conclusion that there was any risk of impairment. The main assumptions used were a 0.5% increase in the discount rate and a 0.5% reduction in the perpetuity growth rate. The Group estimates a 10% increase in turnover with respect to 2022 due to the recovery of the activity in Europe and Nafta and to the positive evolution of the Chinese market, a higher margin on sales between 7.5%-8%, resulting from the improvement initiatives applied, optimisation programmes implemented and the decrease in fixed and variable costs derived from the digitalisation and standardisation efficiency programme implemented in 2019 and 2020. Based on this analysis, at 31 December 2022 the Group recognised impairment losses on property, plant and equipment totalling 62,683 thousand euros (of which _a net amount of 59,547 thousand euros were recognised in _2022, 3,704 thousand euros in 2021 and the rest in years prior to 2021). These losses basically correspond to the_ loss of property, plant and equipment at the plants owned by Grupo Antolin-Kentucky, Inc., Grupo AntolinMichigan, Inc., Antolin Interiors UK, Ltd., Antolin Ebergassing, GmbH, Trimtec, Ltda., Iramec Autopeças, Ltda. and Grupo Antolin Bratislava, s.r.o. for projects that are currently generating losses or have done so in the past and whose recoverable amount is below their book value (at 31 December 2021 the Group had recognised impairments _in the amount of 30,362 thousand euros)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

Subsequently, in June 2015_ a 200-million-euro extension to the syndicated loan (“Loan Facility”) was agreed, increasing the capital of said loan to 400 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent prior to 31 December 2015. On 26 October 2016, the group signed a novation of the “Senior Facilities Agreement”, amending the repayment schedule and extending the final maturity date of the contract to 2021 (originally this was 2020) and the interest rate was modified (Euribor plus a market spread) thereby reducing the Group's finance costs. Also, on 27 April 2018, a change to the “Senior Facilities Agreement” (“Amendment and Restatement Agreement”) was signed, increasing the syndicated loan by 50 million euros, all of which was drawn by the Parent in 2018. The amount of the loan was 419,204 thousand euros and it was divided into three tranches. In this modification of the loan a new financial entity became a new lender (HSBC Bank plc), the final maturity of the contract was extended until 2023, and the repayment schedule was changed as was the interest rate, reducing the cost of this financing. Additionally, on 3 June 2020 a new amendment of this financing agreement was executed, which allowed the Group the possibility of additional financing in an aggregate amount of up to 200 million euros. In 2021 the Parent completed a process to refinance the “Senior Facilities Agreement” _(“Amendment and Restatement Agreement”)_ in order to extend the repayment schedule. In this loan amendment a new financial entity was included as lender (Instituto de Crédito Oficial - ICO), the final maturity of the agreement was extended through 2026 and the repayment schedule and applicable interest rate were modified. In accordance with IFRS 9 requirements, the Group assessed that the present value of the cash flows deducted under the new conditions, using the original effective interest rate for the deduction, differs by less than 10% from the present discounted value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. The Group calculated the differential amount of the present value of the future contractual cash flows discounted at the debt's original effective interest rate with respect to the amortised cost recorded without reaching a significant quantity for recognition in the annual financial statements. In relation to the multi-currency Revolving Credit Facility, with the inclusion of the Instituto de Crédito Oficial (ICO) as lender, it was agreed to reduce the total available amount from 200 million euros (initially granted) to 193,550 thousand euros. Lastly, in 2022 a new amendment to this financing agreement was executed, under which certain adjustments were included in relation to the financial ratios which the Group is required to achieve, taking into account the restructuring costs and the synergies included in the 2023-2026 Business plan. During 2022 and 2021, the Group repaid 16,127 and 11,570 thousand euros, respectively, of these financing agreements. The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2022 and 2021 was 369,587 and 385,714 thousand euros, respectively, and so at those dates the Group had not drawn any amount against the multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility. The outstanding principal on the syndicated loan at 31 December 2022 and 2021 has the following repayment schedule: ----- Thousands of Euros Maturing in: 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Total At 31/12/22      - 15,727 31,454 157,271 165,135 **369,587 At 31/12/21 16,127 15,727 31,454 157,271 165,135 **385,714 Notwithstanding the above schedule, the Group may, at any moment during the life of the loan, opt to repay all or part of the outstanding syndicated loan or multi-currency revolving credit facility, provided certain conditions are met. Furthermore, the following events will trigger full or partial early repayment of these loans: - Subject to certain exceptions and amounts, the disposal of specific asset categories, the receipt of indemnities from insurance companies or the flotation of the Parent (with no change of control of the Group). - In the event of a change of control in the Group, any of the financial institutions may decide to leave the financing arrangements in place or may request early repayment of the proportional part of the loan corresponding to said institution. _Interest-_ These loans accrue annual interest benchmarked to the Euribor, plus a variable market spread, that is reviewed annually on the basis of certain financial ratios. The Group must also pay a commission with respect to the undrawn amount of the multi-currency revolving credit facility. _Loan guarantees-_ These loans are backed by an irrevocable and unconditional guarantee from a significant number of the companies forming Grupo Antolin, although the guarantees provided by some subsidiaries _(specifically certain Portuguese, _Czech, Austrian and German companies) are limited to amounts established by the applicable local legislation. In_ order to comply with the obligations related to these loans, the Group has given a commitment to each of the subsidiaries in which it holds at least 90% of the share capital, that it will become a guarantor if any of the following circumstances arises: its EBITDA for the year represents at least 2.5% of the Group's EBITDA and exceeds 5 million euros. In addition, liens have been established on the share capital of the Parent (see Note 13). _Early repayment-_ The Senior Facilities Agreement under which these loans were ceded includes clauses specifying that the following events will trigger its full early repayment: - Failure to repay the principal or pay the interest on the loans as and when they fall due. - Failure of the Group to meet the financial ratios set in the agreement under which these loans were ceded or to remedy said failure within 20 days of the issue of the “ratio compliance certificate” in which it is detailed. - Failure to comply with other obligations established in the loan agreement (false disclosures, failure to provide _information, etc.) without rectifying said failure within a determined period._ - Failure to pay other borrowings falling due, provided certain circumstances are met, or the insolvency of the Parent, a material subsidiary, or the shareholders. - A change in the ownership of the shares of the Parent, or the cession of businesses, expropriation, lawsuits and |Col1|Thousands of Euros|Col3|Col4|Col5|Col6|Col7| |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| ||Maturing in:|||||Total| ||2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|| |At 31/12/22 At 31/12/21|- 16,127|15,727 15,727|31,454 31,454|157,271 157,271|165,135 165,135|369,587 385,714| ----- a material adverse effect on the Group.

At 31 December 2022, the Parent's Directors considered that all clauses and obligations set out in the financing agreement and their subsequent amendments had been fulfilled, and that no grounds for early maturity or partial or total early repayment had occurred. They also consider that all conditions will be met fulfilled in the following 12 months. _Other obligations and commitments-_ The Senior Facilities Agreement contains certain obligations and commitments limiting the Group's capacity to perform certain operations during the life of the loans, including the following: - Limits on obtaining additional financing, the constitution of charges or guarantees against its assets, and the granting of guarantees or sureties to third parties. - Limits on the sale, cession, transfer or disposal of its assets. - Limits on the acquisition of companies or businesses. - Limits on the distribution of dividends by the Parent (see Note 13).",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

P.º de la Castellana, 259C 28046 Madrid ## Independent Auditor's Report on the Consolidated Financial Statements _(Translation from the original in Spanish. In the event of discrepancy, the Spanish-language version prevails.)_ To the Sole Shareholder of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. ##### REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS #### Opinion We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. (the “Parent”) and subsidiaries (together the “Group”), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2022, and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view, in all material respects, of the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group at 31 December 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS-EU) and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable in Spain. #### Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's _Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report._ We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements pursuant to the legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain. We have not provided any nonaudit services, nor have any situations or circumstances arisen which, under the aforementioned regulations, have affected the required independence such that this has been compromised. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ----- #### Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. |Recoverable amount of non-current assets See notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2| |---|---| |Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit| |At 31 December 2022 the Group has intangible assets with a carrying amount of Euros 319,006 thousand, property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of Euros 644,204 thousand and goodwill with a carrying amount of Euros 90,206 thousand allocated to the pertinent cash-generating units. At 31 December 2022 impairment of Euros 138,042 thousand has been recognised on intangible assets and Euros 62,683 on property, plant and equipment, of which Euros 85,025 thousand and Euros 59,547 thousand, respectively, were recognised in 2022. The Group calculates the recoverable amount of goodwill annually and tests property, plant and equipment and intangible assets for indications of impairment, for the purposes of determining their recoverable amount. The Group has calculated the recoverable amount of goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for which it has identified indications of impairment by applying valuation techniques that require the exercising of judgement and the use of assumptions by management and the Directors. Due to the high level of judgement and the uncertainty associated with these assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, their measurement has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Assessing the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of estimating the recoverable amount of goodwill and other non-current assets. - Assessing the criteria used by the Directors and Group management when identifying indications of impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill. - Evaluating the methodology and assumptions used by management and the Directors to estimate the recoverable amount applying the discounted cash flow method at cash-generating unit level, with the involvement of our valuation specialists. - Comparing the cash flow forecasts estimated in prior years with the actual cash flows obtained. - Contrasting the information contained in the model used to calculate the recoverable amount with the Group's business plans approved by management. - Analysing the sensitivity of the estimated recoverable amount to changes in the relevant assumptions and judgements, such as the discount rate and the expected future growth rate used to estimate future cash flows. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.| ----- |Capitalisation of development expenses See note 7 to the consolidated financial statements|Col2| |---|---| |Key audit matter|How the matter was addressed in our audit| |In 2022 the Group capitalised development expenses amounting to Euros 84,786 thousand and at 31 December 2022 the Group has capitalised total development expenses of Euros 265,124 thousand under other intangible assets. The capitalisation of development expenses requires an analysis of compliance with the requirements laid down in the financial reporting framework. If there are reasonable doubts as to the technical success or economic-financial feasibility of the projects, the amounts recognised as assets should be taken directly to the consolidated income statement, and therefore there is a risk that the capitalised costs would not meet the criteria set forth in the financial reporting framework for their capitalisation. Due to the judgement associated with the foregoing assessments and estimates, and the significance of the carrying amounts involved, capitalisation of such costs as development expenses has been considered a key audit matter.|Our audit procedures included the following: - Evaluating the design and implementation of the key controls related to the process of recognising development expenses and identifying, where applicable, the expenses that qualify for capitalisation. - Performing tests of detail for a sample of capitalised development expenses, corroborating the amounts capitalised and analysing the supporting documentation prepared by management and which substantiates the technical success and economic-financial feasibility of the projects, assessing the reasonableness of the main assumptions considered. We also assessed whether the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements meet the reporting requirements of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group.| #### Other Information: Consolidated Directors’ Report Other information solely comprises the 2022 consolidated directors' report, the preparation of which is the responsibility of the Parent's Directors and which does not form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not encompass the consolidated directors' report. Our responsibility regarding the information contained in the consolidated directors’ report is defined in the legislation regulating the audit of accounts, as follows: a) Determine, solely, whether the consolidated non-financial information statement has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, and if not, to report on this matter. b) Assess and report on the consistency of the rest of the information included in the consolidated directors’ report with the consolidated financial statements, based on knowledge of the Group obtained during the audit of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements. Also, assess and report on whether the content and presentation of this part of the consolidated directors’ report are in accordance with applicable legislation. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there are material misstatements, we are required to report them. ----- Based on the work carried out, as described above, we have observed that the information mentioned in section a) above has been provided in the manner stipulated in the applicable legislation, that the rest of the information contained in the consolidated directors’ report is consistent with that disclosed in the consolidated financial statements for 2022, and that the content and presentation of the report are in accordance with applicable legislation. #### Directors' and Audit Committee's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Parent's Directors are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in such a way that they give a true and fair view of the consolidated equity, consolidated financial position and consolidated financial performance of the Group in accordance with IFRS-EU and other provisions of the financial reporting framework applicable to the Group in Spain, and for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent's Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. The audit committee is responsible for overseeing the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements. #### Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with prevailing legislation regulating the audit of accounts in Spain, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: #### – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ----- #### – Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. #### – Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Parent's Directors. #### – Conclude on the appropriateness of the Parent's Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. #### – Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view. #### – Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the audit committee of the Parent regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Parent's audit committee with a statement that we have complied with the applicable ethical requirements, including those regarding independence, and to communicate with them all matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated to the audit committee of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U., we determine those that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. ----- ##### REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS #### Additional Report to the Audit Committee of the Parent The opinion expressed in this report is consistent with our additional report to the audit committee of Grupo Antolin-Irausa, S.A.U. dated 25 April 2023. #### Contract Period We were appointed as auditor of the Group by the sole shareholder on 20 July 2021 for a period of three years, beginning the year ended 31 December 2021.

Also, certain clarifications are introduced in relation to the recognition of contingent assets and liabilities. The amendment prohibits deducting from the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment any proceeds from selling items produced while the entity is bringing that asset to the location and condition necessary for its intended use. The proceeds from the sale of samples, together with the related production costs, must be recognised in profit or loss. The amendment explains that the cost of fulfilling a contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling the contract.

The main accounting principles and policies and measurement criteria used are disclosed in Note 3. In preparing the consolidated annual financial statements for 2022, estimates made by the Group's Senior Management _(subsequently ratified by the Parent's Directors) were used on occasion to measure certain assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and commitments recognised in them and that could have a significant impact over the next twelve months. These estimates, made based on the best information available, refer to: - The assessment of signs of impairment losses in PPE and calculation of its recoverable value (Note 8). - The assessment of the technical success of the projects and their profitability (Note 7). - The measurement of goodwill (Note 7). - Recognition and recoverability of deferred tax assets (Note 19). - The capacity to exercise control over some consolidated companies and the timing thereof (Note 1).

The Parent is exposed, or has the right, to variable returns for its involvement in the subsidiary when the returns it obtains through that involvement may change based on the entity's economic performance. A structured entity is one that is designed so that voting and similar rights are not essential when determining who controls the entity, e.g. in the event that possible voting rights refer exclusively to administrative activities and these are governed by contractual agreements. Subsidiary revenues, expenses and cash flows are included in the consolidated annual financial statements as of the date of acquisition, which is the date on which the Group effectively obtains control over them. Subsidiaries are excluded from consolidation as of the date on which that control is lost. The transactions and balances with Group companies and unrealised profits or losses have been eliminated in the consolidation process. However, unrealised losses were considered as a sign of impaired value of the transferred assets. Subsidiary accounting policies have been adapted to the Group's accounting policies, for transactions and other events that are similar and occurred under similar circumstances. The annual financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the consolidation process refer to the same reporting date and period as those of the Company. The individual annual financial statements of _“subsidiaries” have been fully consolidated with those of the Parent. _Business combinations-_ The Group applies the acquisition method in business combinations. The acquisition date is the one on which the Group obtains control over the business acquired. The consideration delivered for the business combination is determined on the acquisition date by the sum of the fair values of the assets delivered, the liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued and any contingent consideration dependent on future events or on compliance with certain conditions in exchange for the control over the business acquired. The consideration delivered excludes any payment that does not form part of the exchange for the business acquired. Costs relating to the acquisition are recognised as an expense when they are incurred. On the acquisition date the Group recognises the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed (and any other non_controlling interest) at their fair value. The non-controlling interest in the business acquired is recognised at the amount corresponding to the percentage in the fair value of the net assets acquired. This criterion solely applies to non-controlling interests that grant present access to financial profits and the right to the proportional part of the acquired entity's net assets in the event of liquidation. Otherwise, non-controlling interests are recognised at fair value or at the value based on market conditions. The liabilities assumed include contingent liabilities insofar as they represent present obligations arising from past events whose fair value may be reliably measured. The Group also recognises indemnification assets allocated by the seller at the same time and following the same measurement criteria for the indemnification item of the acquired business, considering the risk of insolvency and any contractual restriction on the indemnified amount, as appropriate. The application of this criterion excludes non-current assets or disposable groups of elements classified as held for sale, liabilities for long-term defined benefits, transactions with payments based on equity instruments, deferred tax assets and liabilities and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of previously granted rights. ----- The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are classified and designated for subsequent recognition on the basis of contractual agreements, financial conditions, accounting and operating policies and other conditions existing on the acquisition date, with the exception of leases in which the business acquired is the landlord and insurance. Any excess existing between the consideration provided plus the value assigned to the non-controlling interests and the net amount of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In relation to any deficiency existing after assessing the amount of the consideration provided, the value assigned to the non-controlling interests and the identification and measurement of the net assets acquired are recognised as a separate item in the consolidated income statement. _Non-controlling interests-_ Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired as of 1 January 2004 are recorded on the acquisition date by the percentage held in the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries acquired before the transition date were recognised by the percentage in equity on the date of first-time consolidation. Non-controlling interests are presented in consolidated net equity separately from the equity attributed to the Parent's shareholders. Non-controlling interests in consolidated profit/(loss) for the year _(and in other _consolidated comprehensive income for the year) are also presented for the year separately in the_ consolidated income statement (consolidated comprehensive income statement). The Group's interest and the non-controlling interests in the consolidated profit/(loss) for the year _(consolidated comprehensive income for the year) and in changes in net equity of the subsidiaries, after_ considering adjustments and eliminations arising from consolidation, are determined from ownership interests at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights and after deducting the effect of dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights classified in net equity accounts. However, the Group's interest and the non-controlling interests are determined considering the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other financial derivatives, that essentially grant current access to the returns associated with subsidiary ownership. Any excess losses attributable to non-controlling interests generated prior to 1 January 2010, not attributable to these because they exceed the amount of interest in the subsidiary's equity, are recorded as a decrease in net equity attributable to Parent shareholders, except in those cases in which the non-controlling interests have a binding obligation to assume all or part of the losses and have the ability to make the necessary additional investment. The profits obtained in subsequent years are assigned to the net equity attributable to Parent shareholders, until the recovery of the amount of the losses absorbed in prior reporting periods that correspond to non-controlling interests. As of 1 January 2010, the profit/(loss) and each component of other comprehensive income are assigned to the net equity attributable to Parent shareholders and to non-controlling interests in proportion to their interest, even if this entails a deficit balance of non-controlling interests. The agreements executed between the Group and non-controlling interests are recognised as a separate transaction. _Associates-_ Associates are those entities over which the Company exercises significant influence, directly or indirectly via subsidiaries. Significant influence is the power to participate in an entity's financial and operating policy decisions, without the existence of control or joint control. In determining the existence of significant influence, potential voting rights are considered, whether exercisable or convertible on the closing date of each year, and likewise considering any potential voting rights held by the Group or another entity. Investments in associates are recorded by the equity method from the date on which the significant influence is exercised to the date on which the Company is unable to continue to justify its existence. Nevertheless, if on the acquisition date all or part of the investment complies with the conditions for classification as non ----- current assets or disposable groups of elements held for sale, it will be recorded at fair value less any costs of sale or disposal by other means. Investments in associates are initially recognised at their acquisition cost, additionally including any additional cost directly attributable to the acquisition and any contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability that depends on future events or on the fulfilment of certain conditions. The excess between the investment cost and the percentage corresponding to the Group in the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill, which is included in the investment's book value. Any deficiency, after measuring the amounts of the investment cost and identification and assessment of the associate's net assets, is recorded as revenue in determining the investor's interest in the associate's profit/(loss) for the year of its acquisition. If the investment results in the loss of control of a subsidiary that does not constitute a business, the cost of the investment is the fair value, net of any eliminations from the results of the loss of control. The accounting policies of associates were subject to timing and measurement unification in the same terms as those referenced for subsidiaries. The Group's interest in profits or losses of associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments with a credit or debit to Equity Participation in profit/(loss) for the year, recorded by applying the equity method of the consolidated income statement _(consolidated comprehensive income statement). Likewise, the Group's interest in profits or losses of_ associates obtained as of the acquisition date is recorded as an increase or decrease in the value of the investments in the associates, recognising the itemised consideration in other comprehensive income. Dividend distributions are recorded as decreases in the investment values. The Group's interest in profits or losses, including impairment losses recognised by the associates, will consider revenue or expenses deriving from the acquisition method. The Group's interest in profits or losses of the associates and in changes to net equity is determined on the basis of its ownership interest at year-end, without considering the possible exercise or conversion of potential voting rights. However, the Group's interest is determined considering the possible exercise of potential voting rights and other financial derivatives that essentially grant current access to the returns relating to associate ownership interest. The Group's interest in profits or losses of the associates is recorded after considering the effect of the dividends, resolved or otherwise, of preferred shares with cumulative rights classified in net equity accounts. The losses in associates that correspond to the Group are limited to the net investment value, except in those cases in which the Group has assumed legal or implicit obligations, or has made payments on behalf of the associates. To recognise impairment losses in associates, the net investment is considered as the result of adding the book value resulting from the application of the equity method to the one that corresponds to any other item that essentially forms part of the investment in the associates. Any excess of losses on the investment in equity instruments is applied to the rest of the items in reverse order of priority on liquidation. The profits subsequently obtained by those associates in which recognition of losses is limited to the value of the investment are recorded to the extent that they exceed any losses not previously recognised. The Group applies financial instrument measurement criteria to the other items that form part of the net investment and to which the equity method is not applied, prior to recognising the aforementioned losses. In applying those criteria, the Group does not consider the recognition of losses deriving from the equity method in the book value of these items. As a result of this, the measurement criteria of those items at fair value and value impairment, where appropriate, change the recognition of the items deriving from the equity method in prior periods and the year underway. Profits and losses not realised in transactions performed between the Group and associates are only recognised to the extent that they correspond to unrelated investors' interests The recognition of unrealised ----- criterion. However, profits and losses deriving from transactions between the Group and associates of net assets that constitute a business will be recognised in their entirety. Unrealised profits or losses of non-monetary contributions of assets to associates that do not constitute a Group business are recorded in keeping with the value of the transactions. In this regard, if the transferred assets remain in the associate and the transaction is commercial in nature, only the proportional part of the profits or losses that correspond to the rest of the investors is recognised. Otherwise, no profit/(loss) is recognised for the transaction. Deferred profit/(loss) is recognised against the value of the interest. Furthermore, unrealised losses are eliminated insofar as they do not constitute proof of impairment of the transferred asset. If in the non-monetary contribution and in addition to the interest, the Group receives monetary or non-monetary assets, the profit/(loss) of the transaction corresponding to the latter is recognised. In non-monetary contributions of Group businesses to associates, profits and losses are recognised in their entirety. The Group applies the criteria indicated in the financial instrument accounting policy, including any impairment adjustments to the other financial instruments to which the equity method is not applied, including those that form part of the net investment in the associate. The recognition of losses from applying the equity method or impairment of the financial instruments that form part of the net investment in the associate are not considered in applying the measurement criteria indicated in the financial instrument policy. Once the equity method is applied, the Group assesses whether objective evidence of net impairment exists in the associate. Calculation of impairment is determined as a result of the comparison of the book value relating to the net investment in the associate with its recoverable value, with recoverable value deemed to be the greater of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell or of disposal by other means. In this connection, the value in use is calculated on the basis of the Group's interest in the present value of the estimated cash flows from ordinary activities and from any amounts that could result from the final sale of the associate. The recoverable amount of the investment in an associate is measured with regard to each associate, unless it is not a cash generating unit (CGU). The impairment loss is not assigned to goodwill or to other implicit assets in the investment in associates deriving from the application of the acquisition method. In subsequent years value reversals of investments are recognised against profit/(loss), to the extent that an increase in recoverable value exists. Impairment loss is presented separately from the Group's interest in associate profit/(loss). _Joint agreements-_ Joint agreements are considered to be those in which a contractual agreement exists to share control over an economic activity, so that any decisions on relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the Group and the rest of the investors or operators. The assessment of the existence of joint control takes place by considering the subsidiaries' definition of control. _i)_ _Joint operations_ In joint operations, the Group recognises its assets in the consolidated annual financial statements, including its interest in jointly-controlled assets; its liabilities, including its interest in any liabilities incurred jointly with other operators; the revenue obtained from the sale of its part of the production deriving from the joint operation, its part of revenue obtained from the sale of the production deriving from the joint operation, its expenses, including the part of the joint expenses that corresponds to it. ----- The Group's acquisition of the initial and subsequent interest in a joint operation constituting a business is recognised by applying the criteria for business combinations as the percentage interest it holds in the individual assets and liabilities. Nevertheless, in the subsequent acquisition of additional interest in a joint operation, the prior interest in the individual assets and liabilities is not subject to revaluation, insofar as the Group maintains joint control. In sale or contribution transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit/(loss) corresponding to the interest of the rest of the operators is recognised, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or impairment of the assets transferred, in which case they are recognised in their entirety. In purchase or contribution transactions by the Group to joint operations, only the profit/(loss) is recognised when the assets acquired are sold to third parties, unless the losses reveal a loss in value or impairment of the assets acquired, in which case the Group recognises the proportional part of any losses that correspond to it in their entirety. _Transactions and balances in foreign currency- i)_ _Functional and presentation currency_ The consolidated annual financial statements are presented in thousands of euros, which is the Parent's functional and presentation currency, rounded off to the nearest thousand. _ii)_ _Transactions, balances and cash flows in foreign currency_ Transactions in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency on the dates on which the transactions take place. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are translated into euros by applying the existing rate at year-end, while non-monetary ones measured at historical cost are translated by applying the exchange rights applied on the date on which the transaction took place. For these purposes, supplier and customer advances are considered non-monetary items, whereby they are translated at the exchange rate on the date on which the payment or collection took place. The subsequent posting of the reception of inventories or revenue from sales, for the part of the advance, takes place at the original exchange rate and not the one on the transaction date. Finally, the translation into euros of nonmonetary assets measured at fair value is performed by applying the exchange rate on the date of their quantification. In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statement, flows from foreign currency transactions are translated into euros by applying exchange rates existing on the date on which they took place. The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash and cash equivalents in foreign currency are presented separately in the cash flow statement as “Effect of exchange rate differences on cash”. The differences revealed in the settlement of transactions in foreign currency and in the translation into euros of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency are recognised in profit/(loss). However, the exchange differences arising in monetary items that form part of the net business investment abroad are recorded as translation differences in other comprehensive income. Exchange gains or losses relating to monetary financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currency are also recognised in profit/(loss). Monetary financial assets denominated in foreign currency classified at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income, are considered to be posted at amortised cost in the foreign currency and, therefore, the exchange differences associated with any changes in amortised cost are recognised in profit/(loss) and the rest of the change in fair value is recognised as set out in section i). ----- The Group presents the effect of the translation of deferred tax assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency jointly with the deferred income tax in profit/(loss). Exchange gains or losses of non-monetary financial assets and liabilities and monetary financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value with changes in profit/(loss), are recognised jointly with a change in the fair value in other comprehensive income or in profit/(loss). The rest of the change in fair value is recognised as set out in section i). Nevertheless, the component of the change to the exchange rate of equity instruments denominated in foreign currency and measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income and classified as fair value hedges of that component, is recognised in other comprehensive income. _iii)_ _Translation of foreign businesses_ The Group availed itself of the exemption in IFRS 1 “First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards”, regarding cumulative translation differences, whereby the translation differences recognised in the consolidated annual financial statements generated prior to 1 January 2004 were included in reserves for cumulative gains. As of that date, the translation into euros of foreign businesses whose functional currency is not from a hyper-inflationary country was performed by the application of the following criteria: - Assets and liabilities, including goodwill and adjustments to net assets deriving from business acquisition, including comparative balances, are translated at the closing rate on the date of each balance sheet; - Revenue and expenses, including comparative balances, are translated at the exchange rates in force on the date of each transaction; and - Exchange rate differences resulting from the application of the above criteria are recognised as translation differences in other comprehensive income; This same criteria are applicable to the translation of financial statements of companies accounted for using the equity method, whose translation differences that correspond to the Group's interest are recognised in other comprehensive income. In the presentation of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash flows, including comparative balances, of foreign subsidiaries and joint businesses are translated into euros by applying exchange rates existing on the date on which they took place. Translation differences recorded in other comprehensive income are recognised in profit/(loss), as an adjustment to the profit/(loss) from the sale, following the criteria set out in the sections on subsidiary and associate entities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,523

As a result of this transaction, the Group now has a 100% shareholding in said company and exercises control over it.
