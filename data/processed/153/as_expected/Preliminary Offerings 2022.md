-----

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying on the exemption from the
provisions of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that this Offering Memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into whose
possession this Offering Memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are
located and you may not, nor are you authorized to, deliver this Offering Memorandum to any other person. If you receive this
Offering Memorandum by e-mail, you should not reply by e-mail to this communication. Any reply e-mail communications, including
those you generated by using the “Reply” function on your e-mail software, will be ignored or rejected. If you receive this Offering
Memorandum by e-mail, your use of this email is at your own risk and it is your responsibility to take precautions to ensure that it
is free from viruses and other items of a destructive nature.

Under no circumstances shall this Offering Memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall
there be any sale of, the securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. If a jurisdiction
requires that the offering and sale of the securities be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any affiliate
of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering of the securities shall be deemed to be made
by them or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuers (as defined in this Offering Memorandum) in such jurisdiction.

This Offering Memorandum has been sent to you in electronic format. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this
medium may be altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission, and consequently, none of the Initial Purchasers
of the New Notes, any person who controls any of the Initial Purchasers, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or
agent of theirs, respectively, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in
respect of any difference between the Offering Memorandum distributed to you in electronic format and the hard copy version
available to you on request from the Initial Purchasers.

The Offering Memorandum has not been approved for the purposes of Section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000
as amended (the “FSMA”) by an authorized person under FSMA. In the United Kingdom, the Offering Memorandum and any other
material in relation to the securities described therein are being distributed only to, and are directed only at, persons who are
“qualified investors” (as defined in the UK Prospectus Regulation) who are (i) persons having professional experience in matters
relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005
(the “Order”), or (ii) high net worth entities falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) of the Order, or (iii) persons to whom it would
otherwise be lawful to distribute them, all such persons together being referred to as “Relevant Persons.” The securities are only
available to, and any invitation, offer or agreement to subscribe, purchase or otherwise acquire such securities will be engaged in
only with, Relevant Persons. The Offering Memorandum and its contents are confidential and should not be distributed, published
or reproduced (in whole or in part) or disclosed by any recipients to any other person in the United Kingdom. Any person in the
United Kingdom that is not a Relevant Person should not act or rely on the Offering Memorandum or its contents.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within
the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuers (as defined herein).

This Offering Memorandum is not an offer to sell the securities described herein and it is not a solicitation of an offer to buy the
securities described herein in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is not permitted.

**Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer, the target market assessment in respect of the
securities described in the Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the securities is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels
for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect
of the securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**Prohibition of Sales to EEA and United Kingdom Retail Investors**

The securities described in the Offering Memorandum are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and
should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For
these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1)
of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (as amended of superseded, the “Insurance Distribution
**Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or**


-----

(iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation (as applicable). Consequently
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or
selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or
the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities described in the Offering Memorandum or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the securities in the EEA or the UK will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation (as applicable) from the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of the securities. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Luxembourg, having its registered office at 63-65 rue de Merl, L-2146 Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register under number B
234.205 (the “Luxembourg Issuer” and together with the U.S. Issuer, are each an “Issuer” and collectively the “Issuers”) are jointly and severally hereby offering as co-issuers (the “Offering”) $
aggregate principal amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the “Additional Dollar Notes”) and € aggregate principal
amount of its % Senior Secured Notes due 2030 (the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Notes, the “New Notes”). The New Notes will be, and the Existing Notes (as defined
below) are, guaranteed on a senior basis by I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with registered number 11063542 (the “Parent Guarantor”), I–Logic
Technologies UK Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales with registered number 11060687 (“Holdings”), and certain subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor. The Additional Dollar Notes
will be issued pursuant to the indenture dated May 13, 2021 (the “Existing Dollar Notes Issue Date”), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated June 10, 2021 and the second

Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as Paying Agent and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch as Registrar and Transfer Agent (the “Dollar Indenture”). The Additional Dollar
Notes will not form a single series with the $350,000,000 5.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Existing Dollar Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Notes the “Dollar Notes”). The
Additional Dollar Notes will be issued and trade with different ISINs and CUSIPs than those assigned to the Existing Dollar Notes and will not be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the
Existing Dollar Notes. The Euro Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture to be dated on or around the Issue Date among, inter alios, the Issuers, Lucid Trustee Services Limited as Trustee and
Security Agent, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as Paying Agent and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch as Registrar and Transfer Agent (the “Euro Indenture” and

of the New Notes (i) to refinance indebtedness used to finance the Backstop Acquisition, (ii) to fund a dividend for the repurchase of shares from certain minority shareholders in one or more of our
parent companies, (iii) to partially prepay amounts drawn under the Existing Credit Facility and (iv) to fund general corporate purposes and pay transaction costs associated with the Offering, including
underwriting fees, other financing fees, professional and legal fees, financial advisory fees and other transaction costs. We expect to issue the New Notes on, 2022 (such date of
issue, the “Issue Date.”)

The Additional Dollar Notes will bear interest at the rate of % per annum and the Euro Notes will bear interest at the rate of % per annum, payable semiannually, in each case, in arrear on and of each year, beginning on, 2022. The Additional Dollar Notes will
mature on February, 2030 and the Euro Notes will mature on February, 2030. The Issuers may redeem the Additional Dollar Notes in whole or in
part at any time on or after, 2025 and the Euro Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after, 2025 at the redemption prices specified in
this offering memorandum (this “Offering Memorandum”).

At any time prior to, 2025, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Dollar Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid
interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to, 2025, the Issuers may also
redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes (including additional Notes) with the net proceeds from certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this Offering
Memorandum provided that at least 50% of the principal amount of the Existing Dollar Notes, as applicable (excluding the principal amount of any additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately
after the redemption. At any time prior to, 2025, the Issuers may redeem all or part of the Euro Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, plus a “make-whole” premium, as described in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, prior to, 2025, the Issuers

Offering Memorandum provided that at least 50% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes, as applicable (excluding the principal amount of any additional Notes) remains outstanding immediately
after the redemption.

Upon the occurrence of certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuers may be required to repurchase all of the outstanding Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. Additionally, the Issuers may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Dollar Notes and/or the Euro Notes upon
the occurrence of certain changes in applicable tax law.

The New Notes will be, and the Existing Dollar Notes are, general senior secured obligations of the Issuers. The New Notes will rank, and the Existing Dollar Notes rank, pari passu in right of payment
to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including the Existing Credit Facility). The New Notes will rank, and the Existing
Dollar Notes rank, senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers that is subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The New Notes will be, and the Existing Dollar
Notes are, effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of the Issuers that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property
and assets securing such indebtedness. The New Notes will be, and the Existing Dollar Notes are, structurally subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of Holdings other
than the Issuers and the Guarantors (as defined herein).

The New Notes will be, and the Existing Dollar Notes are, guaranteed on a senior basis, subject to the Agreed Security Principles as set forth in the Indentures (the “Agreed Security Principles”), by
the Parent Guarantor (the “Parent Guarantee”), Holdings and certain wholly owned subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”) that guarantee the Existing Credit Facility and
the Existing Dollar Notes (the “Subsidiary Guarantees” and, together with the Parent Guarantee, the “Notes Guarantees”). The Notes Guarantees will rank, with respect to the New Notes, and rank,
with respect to the Existing Dollar Notes, pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of each Guarantor that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to its Notes
Guarantee (including obligations under the Existing Credit Facility and the Existing Dollar Notes), will rank, with respect to the New Notes, and rank, with respect to the Existing Dollar Notes, senior in
right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of each Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to such Notes Guarantee, will be, with respect to the New Notes, and are, with respect
to the Existing Dollar Notes, effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of each Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantee, to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such indebtedness, and will be, with respect to the New Notes, and are, with respect to the Existing Dollar Notes, structurally subordinated to
any existing and future indebtedness of subsidiaries of such Guarantor that are not themselves guarantors of the Notes. The Existing Dollar Notes are, and, on or around the Issue Date, the New Notes
will be, secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, in the case of any Foreign Subsidiaries (as defined in “Description of the Dollar Notes” and in “Description of the Euro Notes,” as applicable)
and the definitions of “Excluded Subsidiary” and “Excluded Property” (in each case, as defined in “Description of the Dollar Notes” and in “Description of the Euro Notes,” as applicable) in the case of
any Domestic Subsidiaries by first-priority security interests in the Collateral (as defined herein), subject to Permitted Liens. The Collateral also secures the obligations under the Existing Credit Facility
and the Existing Dollar Notes on a first-priority basis, subject to Permitted Liens. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral will be subject to the limitations described in
“Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the New Notes on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange (the “Exchange”). There can be no assurance that the New Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, that such permission to deal in the New Notes will be granted or that such
listing will be maintained.

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

This Offering Memorandum is confidential and has been prepared solely for use in connection with the Offering described herein.
This Offering Memorandum is personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer or solicitation by anyone in any jurisdiction
in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or to any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer or solicitation. No
action has been, or will be, taken to permit a public offering in any jurisdiction where action would be required for that purpose.
Accordingly, the New Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, nor may this Offering Memorandum be distributed, in
any jurisdiction except in accordance with the legal requirements applicable in such jurisdiction. You must comply with all laws
applicable in any jurisdiction in which you buy, offer or sell any New Notes or possess or distribute this Offering Memorandum, and
you must obtain all applicable consents and approvals; neither we nor the Initial Purchasers (as defined below) will have any
responsibility for any of the foregoing legal requirements. See “Transfer Restrictions.”

None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, any of our or their respective representatives or the Trustee, the
Security Agent, Principal Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar (each as defined herein) is making any representation to you
regarding the legality of an investment in the New Notes, and you should not construe anything in this Offering Memorandum as
legal, business, tax or other advice. You should consult your own advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related
aspects of an investment in the New Notes. In making an investment decision regarding any of the New Notes, you must rely on
your own examination of the Issuers and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any member state of the EEA European
Economic Area (“EEA”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as amended (the
“Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes.

No offer of Notes which are the subject of the Offering contemplated by this Offering Memorandum may be made to the public in
a member state of the EEA other than:

(a) to any legal entity which is a “qualified investor” as defined in the Prospectus Regulation;

(b) to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons per member state of the EEA (other than “qualified investors” as defined in the
Prospectus Regulation), subject to obtaining the prior consent of the relevant dealer or dealers nominated by the Issuers
for any such offer; or

(c) in any other circumstances falling within Article 1(4) of the Prospectus Regulation, provided that no such offer of Notes
shall result in a requirement for the Issuers or any Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the
Prospectus Regulation or a supplemental prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the Prospectus Regulation.


-----

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in any member state of
the EEA means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the Offering and the
New Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the New Notes.

**_Professional Investors and Eligible Counterparties Only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer, the target market assessment in respect of the New
Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only,
each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to eligible
counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes
(a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to
MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_Prohibition of Sales to EEA and the United Kingdom Retail Investors_**

The New Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or
more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
2016/97/EU (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client
as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation or the UK
Prospectus Regulation (as applicable). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014
(as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors
in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the New Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

**_Grand Duchy of Luxembourg_**

This Offering Memorandum has not been approved by and will not be submitted for approval to the Luxembourg financial sector
supervisory authority (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) for purposes of public offering or sale in Luxembourg.

Memorandum nor any other offering memorandum, form of application, advertisement or other material related to such Notes may

benefits from an exemption to or constitutes a transaction otherwise not subject to the requirements to publish a prospectus, in
accordance with the Prospectus Regulation and the Luxembourg law of July 16, 2019, on prospectuses for securities.

**_United Kingdom_**

_U.K. MiFIR product governance / Professional Investors and ECPs Only Target Market_

Solely for the purposes of product approval process of each manufacturer, the target market assessment in respect of the securities

in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (“U.K.

person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the “U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

_Prohibition of Sales to U.K. Retail Investors_

Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document

shall result in a requirement for the Issuers or any Initial Purchaser to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the UK
Prospectus Regulation or a supplemental prospectus pursuant to Article 23 of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

For the purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Notes to the public” in relation to any Notes in the United Kingdom

to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the New Notes.

Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) by, a person authorized under the FSMA. This Offering Memorandum may not be
used for, or in connection with, and does not constitute, any offer to, or solicitation by, anyone in any jurisdiction or under any
circumstance in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized or is unlawful. Consequently, this Offering Memorandum is for
distribution only to persons who: (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments (being investment
professionals falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005, as

This Offering Memorandum contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the securities laws of certain jurisdictions,
including statements under the captions “Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations,” “Industry,” “Business” and in other sections. In some cases, these forward-looking statements can be_
identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the words “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,”
“may,” “will,” “plans,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,” “target,” “seek” or “should” or, in each case, their negative
or other variations or comparable terminology or by discussions of strategies, plans, objectives, targets, goals, future events or

throughout this Offering Memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning,
among other things, our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies and the industry in which
we operate.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and
depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Any forward-looking statements are only made as of the date of this Offering Memorandum and we do not intend, and does not
assume any obligation, to update forward-looking statements set forth in this Offering Memorandum.

Many factors may cause our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and the development of the industry in which we
operate to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Offering
Memorandum.

These factors include, among others:

� uncertainty, downturns and changes in the general economy of the markets that we serve, in particular in the financial services
industry and/or due to COVID-19 and related measures;

� high level of competition in the markets in which we operate;

� consolidation of customers as well as cost-cutting across our customer base;

� our ability to invest in, and develop, new software, services, applications and functionalities to meet our customers’ needs,
attract new customers and retain existing ones, expand into new countries and identify areas of higher growth;

� our acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions which may not always be completed or, if completed, perform
as expected and may consume a portion of our management’s focus, increase our leverage and reduce our profitability;

� our ability to integrate our acquisitions with our existing operations;

� risks relating to adjusted EBITDA-based and pro forma financial information;

� unauthorized data access or other cyber-security or privacy breaches;

� failures or disruptions of our own and third-party telecommunications, data centers, network systems and the Internet;

� any interruption or cessation of an important service supplied by any third-party providers and other suppliers on which we
rely for services that are important to our business;

� design defects, errors, failures or delays associated with our software;

� costs and other issues relating to the recruitment, training, management and retention of personnel;

� challenges inherent to doing business globally;

� our ability to maintain customer retention and satisfaction;

� legal and regulatory developments and policy changes;

� exposure to litigation and governmental, regulatory and antitrust proceedings, including liability for content;

� risks to our intellectual property rights and brands; and


-----

� other factors discussed under “Risk Factors.”

These risks and others described under “Risk Factors” are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe
additional factors that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, liquidity and the development of the
industry in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor
can we assess the impact of all such risks on our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other
factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks
and uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

**INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA**

This Offering Memorandum contains historical market data and forecasts which have been obtained from industry publications,
market research and other publicly available information. Certain information regarding market size, market share, market position,
growth rates and other industry data pertaining to us and our business contained in this Offering Memorandum consists of estimates
based on data compiled by professional organizations and on data from other external sources that management deems
reasonable. The data included in such sources, including any surveys, estimates, observations, analyses and forecasts, are based
on various assumptions and other sources which we have not independently verified.

Industry publications and market research generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources
believed to be reliable, but that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed and that the projections they
contain are based on a number of significant assumptions. While we believe that each of the studies and publications we have
used is reliable, neither we nor the Initial Purchasers have independently verified the data that were extracted or derived from
these industry and consultant publications or reports and cannot guarantee their accuracy or completeness. Market data and
statistics are inherently uncertain and not necessarily reflective of actual market conditions. Such statistics are based on market
research, which itself is based on sampling and subjective judgments by both the researchers and the respondents, including
judgments about what types of products and transactions should be included in the relevant market.

We do not intend, and do not assume any obligation, to update industry or market data set forth in this Offering Memorandum.
Because market behavior, preferences and trends are subject to change, prospective investors should be aware that market and
industry information in this Offering Memorandum and estimates based on any data therein may not be reliable indicators of future
market performance or our future results of operations.

We confirm that all such data contained in this Offering Memorandum has been accurately reproduced and, so far as the Issuers
are aware and able to ascertain, no facts have been omitted that would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

Where third-party information has been used in this Offering Memorandum, the source of such information has been identified.

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**Historical Financial Statements**

On November 14, 2017, the Parent Guarantor was incorporated in England and Wales. On December 21, 2017, it acquired a
controlling interest in Diamond Topco Limited and its subsidiaries, including the Dealogic group of companies. On July 11, 2019,
Acuris International Limited, through its subsidiary, Acuris Bidco Limited, acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited, the holding
company of the Acuris group of companies. On February 16, 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, the
Parent Guarantor acquired Acuris Bidco Limited and its subsidiaries (constituting the Acuris business) (the “Acuris Acquisition”).

This Offering Memorandum includes the following financial statements (the “Historical Financial Statements”):

� the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (the “Unaudited Interim Financial Statements”);

� the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2020 (the “FY 2020 Financial Statements”);

� the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 (the “FY 2019 Financial Statements”);

� the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 (the “FY 2018 Financial Statements”);

� the audited revised consolidated financial statements of Acuris International Limited and its subsidiaries as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2020 (“Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements”); and

� the audited revised consolidated financial statements of Acuris International Limited and its subsidiaries as of and for the
period ended December 31, 2019 (“Acuris 2019 Financial Statements”).

**Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements and Acuris 2019 Financial Statements**

At the election of the directors of Acuris International Limited and in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006
and SI 2008/373 The Companies (Revision of Defective Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, the annual report and financial
statements of Acuris International Limited and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and as of and for
the period ended December 31, 2019 have been revised and will be resubmitted to the United Kingdom Companies House to
replace the original annual report and financial statements that were approved by the directors on April 11, 2021 and July 21, 2020,
respectively.

A revision by replacement was deemed necessary after it was identified that Acuris had not correctly accounted for deferred tax
assets in accordance with International Accounting Standard (“IAS”) 12, “Income taxes.” As a result, amendments to the original
annual report and financial statements have been made. The revised annual report and financial statements are now the statutory
financial statements of Acuris International Limited and its subsidiaries. Please refer to Note 26 of the Acuris FY 2020 Financial
Statements and Acuris 2019 Financial Statements for further information.

Ernst & Young’s audit reports with respect to the Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements and Acuris 2019 Financial Statements,
each dated January 20, 2022, include an emphasis of matter paragraph which draws attention to Note 26, which describes the
need for revision, as set out above. The original Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements and Acuris 2019 Financial Statements were
approved on April 11, 2021 and July 21, 2020, respectively, and Ernst & Young’s previous reports were signed April 13, 2021 and
July 28, 2020, respectively. Ernst & Young have not performed a subsequent events review for the period from the date of their
previous reports to the date of these reports. Ernst & Young’s opinions are not modified in this respect.

**Acuris 2019 Unaudited Financial Information**

Acuris International Limited was incorporated on April 18, 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited, the holding company
of the Acuris group on July 11, 2019. Therefore, the audited consolidated financial statements of Acuris International Limited for
the period ended December 31, 2019 cover the period from April 18, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

For purposes of facilitating the comparison of the results of operations of Acuris between 2019 and 2020, the “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this Offering Memorandum also presents a_
discussion of certain key line items of the results of operations of Acuris International Limited for the year ended December 31,


-----

2020 based on the audited Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, as compared to unaudited management information for the year
ended December 31, 2019 (the “Acuris 2019 Unaudited Financial Information”) prepared for illustrative purposes only. Neither
our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with
respect to such management information and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors
have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum.
Moreover, the Acuris 2019 Unaudited Financial Information has not been prepared and shall not be construed to be in compliance
with Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act or the Prospectus Regulation or any other regulations or the SEC or any other
regulator.

**Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information**

This Offering Memorandum includes the unaudited pro forma combined financial information (the “Unaudited Pro Forma
**Combined Financial Information”), which comprises an unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive income of**
the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2020, which gives pro forma effect to the Acuris
Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been derived
from (i) the FY 2020 Financial Statements and (ii) the Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, and certain pro forma adjustments
have been made thereto, _inter alia, to eliminate transactions which were historically made between entities, which are fellow_
subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor as a result of the Acuris Acquisition, and would therefore have been subject to intercompany
elimination.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended
to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act. Neither
the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and the accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with
the Historical Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

This Offering Memorandum also includes unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30,
2021. This financial data has been calculated by adding (i) the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the year
ended December 31, 2020 and (ii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September
30, 2021 and then subtracting (iii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 has been prepared solely for
illustrative purposes for this Offering Memorandum. It is not prepared in the ordinary course of our financial reporting and has not
been audited or reviewed. The unaudited financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 included herein
is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. The unaudited
financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for any future period and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualized calculation.

The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements reflect the results of the Group, including Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l.
and Acuris Finance US, Inc., from the first date that the companies came under common control, and not from the date that the
Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. See “—Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations—Effect of
_Common Control Reorganization.”_

**Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations**

**_Effect of Common Control Reorganization_**

On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco
Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share
exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements reflect the results of operations of the Group, including the transferred companies, from January 1, 2020 as both
companies were under common control at that date, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies
and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the
nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other
Reserves.” As a result of this accounting treatment, the Parent Guarantor’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial
condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and the comparative information for the nine months ended


-----

September 30, 2020) are not comparable with the results of operations and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor and its
subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s and its
subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial position prior to the reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the summary
consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018
and December 31, 2019 (as restated) and as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been extracted from the statutory
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, authorized prior to the reorganization.

**_Acuris Acquisition_**

On July 11, 2019, Acuris International Limited, through its subsidiary, Acuris Bidco Limited, acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited,
the holding company of the Acuris group of companies. In February 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group,
the Parent Guarantor acquired Acuris Bidco Limited and its subsidiaries (constituting the Acuris business). The Parent Guarantor’s
consolidated results of operations and financial position as of and for the financial years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and
2020 do not include any results of the Acuris business. For an illustration of what our results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2020 might have been had the Acuris Acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2020, please refer to “Unaudited
_Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.”_

Additionally, the consolidated financial statements of Acuris International Limited as of and for the period ended December 31,
2019 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum show the consolidated financial results of operations of Acuris International
Limited from April 18, 2019, its date of incorporation, to December 31, 2019. Therefore, these financial statements do not reflect
a full year of operation of the Acuris business in 2019 and are not comparable with the annual financial statements of Acuris
International Limited as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In this
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we will provide a discussion of key line
items from Acuris International Limited’s unaudited income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 (prepared based on
unaudited management information for illustrative purposes only, as compared to Acuris International Limited’s audited income
statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 that forms part of the Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

**_Impact of IFRS 16_**

In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 (Leases), which requires most leases to be recognized as right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities on balance sheets for lessees, thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. IFRS 16 replaces
IAS 17 (Leases) and related interpretations. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For such contracts, IFRS 16 requires a lessee to
recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated and the liability accrues interest. This
results in a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when the lessee pays constant annual rentals. The Parent
Guarantor implemented IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019 and applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach.
On transition to IFRS 16, the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries recognized $12.6 million of right-of-use assets and $16.9 million
lease liabilities. See note 1(s) to the FY 2019 Financial Statements. The FY 2018 Financial Statements have not been restated to
take into account IFRS 16. Acuris International Limited implemented IFRS 16 from its incorporation and the accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the Acuris 2019 Financial Statements and Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements reflect the
requirements of IFRS 16.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

Certain financial measures and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, including EBITDA, EBITDA (Before Foreign
Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses), EBITDA Margin (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other
Gains), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital expenditures, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies), Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination
Synergies Including Backstop), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop),
Recurring Revenue and Non-Recurring Revenue as a percentage of total revenue, and capital expenditures (collectively, the “Non**IFRS Metrics”), are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. These measures**
are presented in this Offering Memorandum because we use them to monitor our financial and operating performance and believe
they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s financial and operating
performance and financing structure. We believe these measures enhance the investor’s understanding of our indebtedness and
our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet and service our obligations. However, there are


-----

no generally accepted accounting principles governing the calculation of non-IFRS financial and operating measures, and other
companies may calculate such measures differently or may use such measures for different purposes than we do and such
measures should therefore not be used to compare us against another company.

We define the Non-IFRS Metrics as follows:

“EBITDA” means earnings before net interest and finance cost, tax and depreciation and amortization.

“EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as EBITDA excluding foreign exchange (gains)/losses.

“EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as EBITDA excluding foreign
exchange (gains)/losses, (gains)/losses on assignment of lease and (gains)/losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment.

“EBITDA Margin (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other Gains)” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign
Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) divided by Revenue.

“Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) excluding
headcount- and staff-related costs and other expenses.

“Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

“Capital expenditures” means capital expenditures other than capitalized development costs.

“Pro Forma Combined EBITDA” is calculated as loss before taxation, adding back tax on loss, net interest and finance cost,
depreciation of property, plant & equipment and amortization of intangible assets, in each case for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Acuris Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1,
2020. Pro Forma Combined EBITDA is derived from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information set out in
“Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.”

“Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as Pro
Forma Combined EBITDA excluding foreign exchange (gains)/losses on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the
Acuris Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020.

“Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange
(Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) after adding back head-count- and staff-related cost savings and other expenses.

“Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma
combined revenue.

“Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA after giving effect to certain synergies and cost savings.

“Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) divided by pro forma combined revenue.

“Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop)” is calculated as Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition, using
estimated adjusted EBITDA of Backstop for the year ended December 31, 2021, as adjusted for pro forma synergies expected to
be achieved in the next 24 months.

“Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop)” is calculated as Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) divided by pro forma revenue reflecting the
Backstop Acquisition.

“Recurring Revenue” means license revenue recognized over time and revenue from post-contractual support.

“Non-Recurring Revenue” means revenue recognized at a point in time and also includes, in the case of the Parent Guarantor
and its subsidiaries, professional services revenue.

See “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data of the Parent Guarantor,” “Summary Historical Financial and other Data of
_Acuris International Limited” and “Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” for a more detailed explanation_
of the Non-IFRS Metrics and how they are calculated.


-----

These Non-IFRS Metrics and other non-IFRS measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often
calculated in ways that reflect the particular circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing these
measures reported by us to such measures or other similar measures as reported by other companies.

An investor should not consider the Non-IFRS Metrics and other non-IFRS measures (a) as a substitute for operating results (as
determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as a substitute for cash flow from or used
in operating, investing and financing activities (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of our ability to meet cash
needs or (c) as a substitute for any other measure of performance under IFRS. These measures may not be indicative of our
historical operating results or financial position and such measures are not meant to be predictive of our future results or financial
position. The non-IFRS financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting
requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. Our management believes this information, along with
comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the
periods presented, and we believe it presents a helpful measure of financial performance between periods by excluding the effect
of certain non-operational items or items we do not believe represent the future costs and run-rate performance of our business.
Nonetheless, the adjustments included in our Non-IFRS Metrics, in some cases, give effect to assumed synergies and savings
that have not yet been achieved, and there is no assurance that we will achieve the benefit of such synergies and savings in the
future.

Even though the Non-IFRS Metrics and other non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess our financial
position, financial results and liquidity and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations
as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial position or results of
operations as reported under IFRS. They may also be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Some of
the limitations of Non-IFRS Metrics are:

� they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments;

� they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our
debt;

� they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay;

� they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement;

� they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of
our ongoing operations;

� they give effect, in some cases, to the benefit of assumed earnings, synergies and cost savings that have not yet been
realized and may not be realized in the future;

� assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and
these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and

� other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as
comparative measures.

Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the financial measures Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with
Combination Synergies Including Backstop), as they are based in part on management’s assumptions regarding the future impact
of cost savings and other actions that have not yet been fully implemented. There is a risk that the synergies that we seek to
achieve may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe and that the magnitude of cost savings may be less than expected.

In addition, our Independent Auditors have not examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to Recurring
Revenue, Non-Recurring Revenue, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with
Combination Synergies), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including Backstop) and related
margins, and accordingly, express no opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to these non-IFRS measures.
Furthermore, our Independent Auditors make no comment as to the reasonableness, appropriateness, or the achievability of
management’s assumptions regarding cost savings, other actions, synergies and the EBITDA expected to be generated by
Backstop.


-----

Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to
invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should
compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only to supplement
your evaluation of our performance. For a description of how our Non-IFRS Metrics are calculated from our Historical Financial
Statements and a reconciliation to our results for the period presented in this Offering Memorandum and a calculation of our other
Non-IFRS Metrics, see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data of the Parent Guarantor—Other Financial Data,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our Historical Financial Statements
and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information on an as adjusted basis to reflect the Offering, as
if it had occurred on September 30, 2021. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data of
_the Parent Guarantor—Other Financial Data” and “Capitalization.” The unaudited as adjusted financial information has been_
prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual results would have been had the offering of the New
Notes occurred on such dates nor do they purport to project our financial position or finance costs or other as adjusted financial
ratios at any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards. Neither the
assumptions underlying the as adjusted adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information have been audited or
reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards.

**Currency Presentation**

References to “Dollar,” “Dollars,” “dollar,” “dollars,” or “$” are to the lawful currency of the United States.

12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma combined basis. This diversity of
customers, who are distributed across the U.S., EMEA and APAC, reduces our dependence on any industry, region or customersize specific trends.

The profile of our revenue by segment, industry, geography and customer concentration on a pro forma combined basis for the
year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]:

The profile of our number of customers across different industries of Dealogic, Acuris and the combined group as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]:

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from long-term subscription-based licenses, which provide us with a highly visible
revenue stream. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Recurring Revenue accounted for 91% (after giving pro forma
effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our overall revenue on a pro forma combined basis. As of September 30, 2021, the Weighted
Average Contract Term of our contracts was 2.26 years and we had a customer retention rate of 95%.

Our business has grown organically and through acquisitions. In July 2019, our affiliate group, the ION Group, acquired Acuris,
and in February 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, Acuris became part of our Group. Acuris is a
leading provider of proprietary, actionable intelligence and analytics to the world’s leading advisors, investors and issuers, with its
embedded products in subscriber workflows. By bringing together Dealogic’s industry-leading data and software with Acuris’ wellknown content and editorial brands and capabilities, the acquisition enabled us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of innovative,
differentiated intelligence and solutions to our customers. While we have retained the original brands of the acquired companies
in order to fulfill our multi-brand strategy and be able to serve a broad set of potential customers, each acquired business has been
fully integrated from a sales, operational and technology perspective. In October 2019, we acquired Selerity, a financial technology
company using proprietary AI to deliver content and data solutions designed to automate inefficient workflows in finance for clients
ranging from sophisticated asset management firms and banks on Wall Street to innovative media and technology companies
serving retail investors. Selerity’s cutting edge technology combined with the ION Group’s well-established product capabilities
enable us to deliver Dealogic and Acuris world-class content to our customers across the integrated ION Analytics platform.

In November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Backstop. The Backstop Acquisition was completed on December
28, 2021. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative and institutional investment industries. It specializes in
integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment and operations firms to build and source manager
relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital and service and communicate with investors.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the following strengths:

**_Highly complementary offering by two prominent names in market data, content and intelligence unlocking significant_**
**_value_**

We bring together two globally recognized companies in capital markets data, content and intelligence, Dealogic and Acuris. The
Acuris Acquisition, which was completed in February 2021, complements our Dealogic offering and helps us deliver a more
comprehensive suite of innovative, differentiated intelligence and data analytics and workflow solutions to our customers. Following
the combination of Dealogic and Acuris, we have an extensive portfolio of leading brands spanning various industries and
geographies, covering a vast spectrum of capabilities to gather, analyze, distribute and harness market data and intelligence.

Our Dealogic offering provides customers with market-leading integrated data, analysis and technology to help them improve
productivity and profitability and facilitate collaboration across a global network to manage resources and target opportunities.
Transforming primary markets through digitization and automation, Dealogic is an established leader in its space, particularly for
over 600 banking and buyside/hedge fund customers, who accounted for 37% and 32% of Dealogic’s customer base, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2020, with legal and other advisers, corporates and private equity firms accounting for 15%, 12%
and 3%, respectively.

Our Acuris offering provides customers with market-leading proprietary information, intelligence and analysis across financial and
M&A markets to help them enhance their market awareness and competitiveness and help them make better investment and
business decisions. As the partner of choice for content and insights to disparate communities of market participants, Acuris caters
to a well-diversified base of over 5,300 customers. Our customers include corporates, legal and other advisors, buyside/hedge
funds, private equity firms and banking clients accounting for 31%, 29%, 21%, 11% and 8% of Acuris’ customer base, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The results generated by our Acuris and Dealogic offerings are fairly balanced, with the Acuris and Dealogic segments accounting
for 60.8% and 39.2% of our pro forma combined revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Our Recurring
Revenue in each of the Acuris and Dealogic segments was 90.2% and 95.6% of Acuris and Dealogic consolidated revenue,
respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

**_Uniquely positioned in large and growing global financial data and analytics markets_**

We operate in a large and growing global market for financial data and analytics, driven by an increasing demand for actionable,
real-time information, intelligence and insights to maintain and improve competitiveness. Our unique and comprehensive multibrand offering across Dealogic and Acuris software and services positions us strongly to address our customers’ market
intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. See “Business—Our Content, Technology and Services.”

We believe there are compelling growth opportunities in this space. According to management estimates based on external
sources, the total addressable market for financial information was estimated to be approximately $33 billion in 2019 and was
expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% between 2019 and 2022 following years of consistent growth. We anticipate that
the global market for financial data, intelligence and analytics will benefit from several trends, including: (i) rapidly evolving
regulatory requirements for financial institutions and corporates, including requirements to report more frequently and requirements
relating to risk management and real-time tracking, (ii) the growing complexity and speed of global financial markets fueling the
demand for real-time data and analytics and the need to proactively manage risk, (iii) rising demand for personalized, targeted
market intelligence and analytical tools and (iv) the increasing adoption of technology, natural language processing and AI-driven
solutions to improve efficiency. The volatile market environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need
to strictly and reliably monitor trades and transactions and manage risks, creating an environment that we expect would be
beneficial to the financial data and analytics market.

**_Diversified, loyal customers cultivated through differentiated long-term commercial model_**

We have a large and expanding customer base, including blue-chip institutions across diversified end markets, and a strong,
longstanding presence among financial institutions. We serve over 6,000 customers (including customers added through the
Backstop Acquisition) and over 150,000 users, including (i) investment banks (excluding sales, trading and research), (ii) legal and
other advisors, (iii) buyside/hedge fund customers (iv) sales trading and research units at investment banks, (v) corporates and
(vi) private equity firms. These categories of customers contributed 36%, 20%, 16%, 12%, 10% and 6% of our pro forma combined
revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our customers are spread globally, with revenue from EMEA, the
U.S and APAC accounting for 42%, 40% and 18% of our revenue, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro
forma combined basis. This diversity of customers reduces our dependence on any factors or trends specific to a single industry,
region or customer size.

Our products are also embedded in subscriber workflows and are mission-critical to originating opportunities for our customers
and driving key decisions relating to M&A transactions and equity issuances across a range of markets. This characteristic, along
with our focus on long-term contracts and our customers’ needs, has resulted in our high customer retention rate of 95% on a pro
forma combined basis as of September 30, 2021. This has also resulted in long-standing customer relationships. For Dealogic, the
top 10 customers have been with us for over 30 years, the top 11 to 50 customers have been with us for over 25 years and the top
51 to 150 customers have been with us for over 17 years. For Acuris, 98% of our top 50 customers have been with us for over 7
years and many of them have been with us for over 15 years. Our Total Contract Value, which we define as Annual Contract Value

4


-----

multiplied by the Weighted Average Contract Term, was $954.0 million as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021
on a pro forma combined basis.

**_Attractive financial profile with highly visible revenue, high margins and robust cash flow generation_**

We derive most of our revenue from long-term subscription-based license contracts, which have provided us with highly visible
revenue streams. Our standard contract for new customers is for a term of one to five years and we consistently aim to improve
our contract terms at renewal. Our Weighted Average Contract Term was 2.26 years and our customer retention rate was 95% as
of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis. On a pro forma combined basis, our
Recurring Revenue accounted for 90% (91% after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our revenue for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021.

We also benefit from strong and stable margins, with a Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination
Synergies including Backstop) of 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. In addition to growing Recurring Revenue,
lower operating costs through continuous cost optimization efforts have contributed to our industry-leading and consistent
profitability.

We enjoy strong cash flow generation and maintain a prudent amount of leverage, with low capital expenditures and structurally
negative working capital due to our billings for subscriptions being made annually in advance. Our net cash inflow from operating
activities as a percentage of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA was 109% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

**_Industry-leading multi-brand portfolio of differentiated, innovative products and services_**

We have developed, maintain and continue to grow an extensive portfolio of industry-leading software and services with
sophisticated and differentiated functionalities and innovative features. Our proprietary software, data and analysis and workflow
management tools are essential to key decision-makers and participants in the global financial markets, including investors,
issuers, investment banks and legal and other advisors. We believe that our business has been historically resilient during
downturns because of the mission-critical nature of our software and services to our customers, in particular during times of market
volatility, and the ability of our software to save costs and drive operational efficiencies.

We believe that our multi-brand software portfolio, which we can tailor to the needs of a broad range of customers in size and
complexity, is a key reason for our competitive success. We continuously innovate our software and build out complementary
products and modules that integrate seamlessly with our main software, thereby delivering additional incremental value to our
customers. For instance, Selerity, our proprietary AI technology acquired in 2019, is catalyzing the development of our nextgeneration products and is bringing machine-learning capabilities to our systems. Also, in 2020, we released a new entitlements
platform and data portal, nearly doubled the number of our public APIs from 7 to 13 and added $6.8 million of ACV and $7.7 million
of TCV in new API sales from 146 new clients. As a result of this broad portfolio and clear brand positioning, we are able to serve
customers with a variety of market intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. In addition, as our
customers grow in size and complexity, we are able to continue to provide them with the right level of software to meet their evolving
needs.

We use a significant portion of our research and development expenditure to differentiate ourselves from our competition, by
expanding our product coverage, improving the user experience of and technology underpinning our software and focusing on
creating tools that personalize insights, automate processes and drive efficiency gains for our customers.

**_Proven operator with differentiated value creation capabilities, playbooks and track record_**

We and the ION Group, which we are a part of, are proven operators of market intelligence and analytics software businesses,
with a track record of successfully acquiring, integrating and improving businesses. We deploy a dual track strategy of acquisition
and organic growth, with our acquisitions geared towards bridging the gaps in our functional footprint or expanding our addressable
market segments while we constantly attempt to innovate and improve both acquired and existing products. We apply the “ION
Playbook” to the businesses that we acquire, leveraging the ION Group’s knowhow as an experienced and lean industrial operator
to deliver greater value for customers through increasing engagement, driving digitization and enabling automation. This has
resulted in a re-engineering of our acquired businesses across three dimensions: (i) organizational re-engineering to remove
unnecessary middle-management layers and remove duplicative and overlapping functions to attract top talent, (ii) commercial reengineering to enhance the visibility of our revenue and improve our contractual terms, including the transition to our standard
multi-year contract and (iii) technological re-engineering to innovate and improve the quality of our software.

Dealogic, which we acquired in 2017, is an illustrative example. Dealogic has performed strongly under our ownership. The
percentage of Dealogic’s Recurring Revenue to total revenue was 94%, 95% and 93%, and 96% for the years ended December

5


-----

31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 (preacquisition), the Weighted Average Contract Term of our Dealogic contracts was 1.6 years while the Total Contract Value for
Dealogic was $208 million. The Weighted Average Contract Term of Dealogic’s contracts was 1.7 years, 2.2 years, 2.8 years and
3.1 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and the Total
Contract Value for Dealogic increased to $233 million, $319 million, $417 million and $475 million, respectively, as of such dates.
We also improved the quality of our Dealogic software, with the number of OriginatION and DistributION product bugs raised per
year decreasing from 480 and 481, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 180 and 75, respectively, for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021.

Acuris, which the ION Group acquired in July 2019 and which we acquired from our affiliate group, the ION Group, in February
2021 following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, is another illustrative example of how our business can drive strong
performance. The Weighted Average Contract Term of Acuris’ contracts was 1.4 years, 1.6 years, 1.7 years and 1.8 years,
respectively, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and twelve months ended September 30, 2021, and the Total Contract Value
for Acuris increased from $334 million in 2018 to $382 million in 2019 to $424 in 2020 and $479 in the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021. The percentage of Acuris’ Recurring Revenue to total revenue was 88% for the period from April 18, 2019 to
December 31, 2019, 89% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 88% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. The
number of Acuris customers was 5,131, 5,295 and 5,391 as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended September
30, 2021, respectively. Acuris also established strong customer engagement, with email click throughs of 12,407 and 19,158 as of
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Acuris’ content production also increased from 175,490 articles and
reports in 2019 to 185,459 in 2020, with approximately 30% of such content being proprietary and 70% curated in each year.

**_Highly experienced management team_**

We are managed by a proven management team, which comprises individuals with significant industry experience and provides
leadership across all functional areas of our business. Led by our CEO Jody Drulard, who has approximately 25 years of experience
with Dealogic, our senior management team has an average of almost 20 years of industry experience and a deep knowledge of
our diverse software portfolio, which we believe provides us with a significant competitive advantage.

**Our Growth Strategy**

**_Continue to harness and enhance our industry-leading portfolio to remain our customers’ partner of choice_**

Our vision is to empower our customers’ decision-making with unique, easily accessible insights and personalized content. As
markets have globalized and become more complex, the amount of financial and operational data has grown exponentially,
increasing the risk that management and execution decisions do not account for this data. With our systems holding an extensive
range of market intelligence and analysis, we intend to provide our customers with data in real time and in a user-friendly format,
enhanced with advanced analytics and visualization tools to enable our customers to make data-driven decisions. We aim to
provide a single-window solution to our customers by bringing together data, analytics and insights on the same platform, enabling
market participants to make optimal decisions in an increasingly competitive environment.

As part of this vision, Dealogic’s mission is to continue transforming primary markets and the way financial firms operate through
digitization and automation and innovative workflow solutions. Acuris’ mission is to be the financial and M&A community’s partner
of choice for market data, intelligence and insights.

We intend to continue differentiating ourselves from our competition, by expanding our product coverage, improving the user
experience and technology of our existing software and focusing on creating tools that personalize insights, automate processes
and drive efficiency gains for our customers. We intend to continue developing and marketing new products that transform data
into real-time insights and add value through integrated workflow solutions. We believe that our continuing focus on digitization
and automation, combined with our ability to deliver personalized, targeted information that saves time and effort, will enable key
decision-makers in the global financial markets to drive optimal decisions.

**_Capitalize on synergies and cross-selling and up-selling opportunities_**

We believe the combination of Dealogic and Acuris is unlocking and will continue to help unlock significant synergies, as reflected
in our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) of $360.3 million for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021.

We also believe the combination provides opportunities to increase our wallet share with existing customers and attract them to
use other software and services across our portfolio. The global demand for real-time data, intelligence and analysis, as well as
visibility and tracking capabilities in connection with organizational workflows, capital markets issuances, M&A deals and a variety

6


-----

of other transactions has increased over time and, in times of uncertainty, will continue to increase. These needs create crossselling and up-selling opportunities across our customer base, which we intend to pursue through unified account coverage,
broader product coverage and joint sales campaigns for both suites of Dealogic and Acuris offerings, thereby becoming an even
greater and more integral partner to our customers.

**_Engage and nurture our growing customer and user community_**

We believe that there are several long-term network effects resulting from our scaled customer and user community. As our
community grows, more data will be generated which can be used to derive better and more accurate insights to provide to our
customers. In addition, an increasing number of customers could provide us with several additional revenue opportunities through
positive network effects by connecting disparate financial communities across global markets.

As we foster these network effects, we believe that the size, diversity and loyalty of our community provides and will continue to
provide us with a competitive advantage.

**_Pursue accretive acquisitions_**

We have grown our business, in part, through acquisitions, such as the formative acquisition of Dealogic in 2017, the acquisition
of Selerity in 2019 and the Acuris Acquisition completed in February 2021. We will selectively consider additional accretive
acquisitions from time to time, such as our recent acquisition of Backstop, an established leader in alternative investment software,
with a large and growing total addressable market, a differentiated customer footprint and a broad and high-quality product offering
in front and middle office. See “—Recent Developments.” Generally, we consider targets that we believe will bridge gaps in our
functional footprint, expand our addressable market segments by adding to our product portfolio and enhancing our ability to crosssell or provide innovative applications or technologies that can integrate into our existing offerings. Through our proven “ION
Playbook,” which includes product, commercial and organizational re-engineering, we constantly attempt to seamlessly integrate
and improve acquired businesses and products in line with our customers’ expectations, thereby adding to our value proposition.
Additionally, we generally seek profitable targets that provide opportunities to generate meaningful cost-saving and revenueenhancing synergies. While we may finance these acquisitions with additional debt, we have a financial policy of maintaining
sustainable and disciplined leverage levels.

**Recent Developments**

On November 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Backstop (the “Backstop **Acquisition”). The Backstop**
Acquisition was completed on December 28, 2021. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative and
institutional investment industries. It specializes in integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment and
operations firms to build and source manager relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital and
service and communicate with investors. Backstop’s customers primarily include endowments, pension funds, insurance
companies, family offices and sovereign wealth funds as well as hedge funds, private equity, venture capital and customers
involved with real estate and infrastructure. Backstop’s revenue, EBITDA and loss from operations for the year ended December
31, 2020 were $34.0 million, $3.9 million and $(5.8) million, respectively. We estimate that our pro forma combined revenue, Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including Backstop) and pro forma combined Recurring Revenue
for the twelve months ended September 31, 2021, would have been approximately $526.3 million, $378.3 million and 91%,
respectively (using Backstop’s estimated results for the year ended December 31, 2021).

Backstop has four core product areas:

� _Portfolio Management: Backstop’s Portfolio Management product consists of a comprehensive platform to track and_
monitor a portfolio of investments across one or more asset classes and provides time-weighted and money-weighted
performance and return statistics.

� _Research Management: Backstop’s Research Management products manage research efforts and diligence processes_
across all asset classes, while providing integrated performance and documents feeds, consultant research and ratings
and collaboration tools.

� _Investor Relations: Backstop’s Investor Relations products include an integrated, web-based branded portal to provide_
secure access and communications between funds and their investors and a platform providing a comprehensive
account management and advanced benchmarking functionality as well as performance data.

7


-----

� _Relationship Management:_ Backstop’s Relationship Management product consists of a purpose-built CRM for the
institutional and alternative investment industry. The product offers a tailored entity structure and robust reporting and
relationship engines which enhance deal lifecycle.

We believe that the Backstop Acquisition will benefit our business by further enhancing our data and technology offering in the
large and growing alternative asset space, deepening our customer relationships with asset managers and accessing new users
and customers among asset allocators. Backstop is an established leader in alternative investment software, with a large and
growing total addressable market, a differentiated customer footprint and a broad and high-quality product offering in front and
middle office. As a result, the Backstop Acquisition will enable us to further extend into the alternative investment industry to better
serve a shared client base, while allowing us to advance our product roadmap, particularly in private debt, family offices and other
strategic end markets. Backstop also has an attractive and resilient business model with high recurring revenue and a sticky
customer base with significant whitespace and upsell opportunity, significant standalone organic and inorganic growth
opportunities, and a strong management team with deep domain expertise. The Backstop Acquisition will allow for significant
revenue synergies from cross-sell, upsell and new data products, will provide a value creation opportunity and will further establish
our global footprint and longstanding customer relationships within the resulting combined global customer base of over 6,000
customers. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of the New Notes to refinance indebtedness used to finance the Backstop
Acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Trading Update**

In the two months ended November 30, 2021, performance has remained stable and revenue and EBITDA increased, as compared
to the two months ended November 30, 2020. Based on preliminary financial data currently available and subject to finalization
and release of our results for the quarter ended December 31, 2021, we expect that our revenue and EBITDA for the quarter ended
December 31, 2021 will be higher, as compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2020, driven by continued stable retention
rates, growth in new customers, cross-selling/upselling and cost savings achievements.

_The preliminary indications set forth above are based on an initial review of our results of operations from our management_
_accounts and may be subject to change. Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have audited,_
_reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such preliminary unaudited financial information for the purpose_
_of its inclusion herein or for any other purposes and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors nor any other independent_
_auditors have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this Offering_
_Memorandum._

Acuris Bidco Limited and its subsidiaries constituting the Acuris business. As part of the internal reorganization, Acuris
International Limited contributed the shares of its subsidiaries to I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited in exchange for a 40%
shareholding in I-Logic Technologies UK Limited. As a result, the Parent Guarantor now controls both the Acuris and
Dealogic businesses.

corporate purposes. Such PIK financing matures later than the Notes. Some of the proceeds of such PIK financing were
used to subscribe in the common equity of Acuris International Limited. See note 13 to the Acuris FY 2020 Financial
Statements.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA OF THE PARENT GUARANTOR**

The following tables present summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor as of the dates and for the periods
indicated. The summary financial information in the tables titled summary consolidated income statement data, summary
consolidated statement of financial position data and summary consolidated statement of cash flows data below have been
extracted without material adjustment from the Historical Financial Statements of the Parent Guarantor. For a detailed discussion
of the presentation of financial data, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.”

The summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 has been derived from the FY 2019 Financial Statements and for the years ended December 31, 2019 (as
restated) and December 31, 2020 has been derived from the FY 2020 Financial Statements, respectively. The summary
consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and
as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 has been derived from the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements.

On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco
Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share
exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from January 1, 2020 as both
companies were under common control at that date, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies
and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the
nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other
Reserves.” As a result of this accounting treatment, the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition as of and
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and the comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020)
are not comparable with the results of operations and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition prior to
the reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its
subsidiaries as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 (as restated) and as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2020 have been extracted from the statutory financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, respectively, authorized prior to the reorganization.

The Historical Financial Statements of the Parent Guarantor contained herein were prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Presentation of financial information in accordance with IFRS requires our management to make various estimates and
assumptions which may impact the values shown in the Historical Financial Statements of the Parent Guarantor and the respective
notes thereto. The actual values may differ from such assumptions. The summary financial data and other data should be read in
conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Selected Historical Financial Data of the Parent Guarantor,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Historical Financial Statements
included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of future expected results.

(a) “Net interest and finance cost” is calculated as finance expenses less finance income, excluding foreign exchange
(gains)/losses.

(b) “Foreign exchange (gains)/losses” primarily relate to the translation gains and losses arising from the balance sheet
revaluation of the euro-denominated Existing Term Loan Facility.

(6) “EBITDA Margin (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as EBITDA (Before
Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) divided by revenue.

(7) “Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses)
excluding headcount- and staff-related costs and other expenses. We present Adjusted EBITDA for the Parent Guarantor
and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 in order to give investors additional information and
insight into the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries’ historical and future financial performance, excluding the effect of
certain non-operational items or items we do not believe represent the future costs and run-rate performance of our
business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize this future run-rate performance or any of these cost savings
and the costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings may outweigh the benefits. For comparability purposes, we
also include Adjusted EBITDA for the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2019 and
2020, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The reconciliation of EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange
(Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated is as follows:

(a) “Headcount- and staff-related costs” relate to the following:

**Year ended** **Nine months ended**
**December 31,** **September 30,**

**2019** **2020** **2020** **2021**
**($ in millions)**

**Headcount- and staff-related costs .....................................** **13.7** **10.4** **30.9** **40.8**
_______________

(i) The cost of two fixed-term management incentive plans, one of which relates to Dealogic and is in effect
until the end of the 2022 fiscal year, and one which relates to Acuris and is in effect until the end of the
2023 fiscal year. Pay-outs under these management incentive plans are contingent on the achievement of
certain EBITDA targets and are therefore not certain to be paid. We have made pay-outs under these
plans in each fiscal year since each plan was in effect; we believe that it is likely, based on our current
performance, that partial or full amounts under each plan will be paid during each fiscal year until
termination of the plans and we currently do not have a new management incentive plan set up to replace
the current one upon its termination.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the cost amounted to $18.3 million, of which $6.3 million
was incurred by Dealogic and $12.0 million was incurred by Acuris. For the nine months ended September
30, 2021, the cost amounted to $19.0 million, of which $7.5 million was incurred by Dealogic and $11.5
million was incurred by Acuris. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, the cost amounted to
$9.0 million and $8.4 million, all of which related to Dealogic.

(ii) Share option expense of $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, $1.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020 and $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 recognized upon
the departure of former senior management following our acquisition of the Dealogic Group.

(iii) Severance costs associated with headcount reduction of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $1.4 million relates to Acuris; $1.3 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2021, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $0.9 million relates
to Acuris; and $1.9 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, all of which
relate to Dealogic.

(iv) Executed Acuris and Dealogic headcount reductions occurring during the year, i.e. “headcount actioned
not yet cash.” “Actioned not yet cash” are cost savings that had been fully actioned by the relevant period
end but not yet been realized for the period (i.e., the amount represents the incremental cost savings that
would have been realized if they had been actioned on the first day of the relevant period).

(b) “Other expenses” primarily relate to rent costs for duplicative office space where the lease has been terminated or
the space has been sublet and non-recurring professional fees.

(8) “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

______________________

(a) “Net interest and finance cost” is calculated as finance expenses of $113,804 thousand less finance income of $2
thousand.

(b) “Foreign exchange (gains)/losses” primarily relate to the translation gains and losses arising from the balance sheet
revaluation of the euro-denominated Existing Term Loan Facility.

(6) “EBITDA Margin (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange
(Gains)/Losses) divided by revenue.

(7) “Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses) excluding headcount- and staffrelated costs and other expenses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize any of these cost savings, and the
costs we incur in trying to realize these cost savings may outweigh the benefits. The reconciliation of EBITDA (Before
Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses) to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 is as follows:

Other expenses[(b)] ................................................................................................................ 2,825
**Adjusted EBITDA ...............................................................................................................** **124,388**

_______________

(a) “Headcount- and staff-related costs” relate to: (i) the cost of a fixed-term management incentive plan in effect until
the end of fiscal year 2023 and whose pay-outs are dependent on the achievement of certain EBITDA targets and
are therefore not certain to be paid, equal to $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; (ii) executed
headcount reductions occurring during the year, i.e. “actioned not yet cash” (which are cost savings that had been
fully actioned by December 31, 2020 but not yet been realized for the entire year ended December 31, 2020, i.e.,
the amount represents the incremental cost savings that would have been realized if they had been actioned on
January 1, 2020) and amounted to $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020; (iii) other costs, primarily
consisting of severance costs associated with the headcount reductions, of $1.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2020; and (iv) one-time non-recurring bonuses of $0.5 million paid in the year ended December 31,
2020 in respect of a 2018 acquisition.

(b) “Other expenses” primarily relate to (i) $2.4 million of earnout provisions relating to the acquisition of Blackpeak
group in 2019, (ii) rent costs for duplicative office space where the lease has been terminated or the space has
been sublet, net of IFRS 16 gain on sub lease, which is a gain of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 and (iv) professional fees incurred for non-recurring litigation, acquisition-related fees (including duplicate
audit fees incurred in the year of acquisition) and fees incurred for software that is not in use of $0.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 2020.

(8) “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

**SUMMARY UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”)
comprises the unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive loss of the Parent Guarantor for the year ended
December 31, 2020 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, which gives pro forma effect to the Acuris Acquisition as
if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been derived from (i) the
FY 2020 Financial Statements and (ii) the Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, and certain pro forma adjustments have been
made thereto, inter alia, to eliminate transactions which were historically made between entities, which are fellow subsidiaries of
the Parent Guarantor as a result of the Acuris Acquisition, and would therefore have been subject to intercompany elimination.

The unaudited consolidated financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 included in this section has
been calculated by adding (i) the unaudited pro forma combined financial information for the year ended December 31, 2020 and
(ii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and then subtracting
(iii) the unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended
to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act. Neither
the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have
been achieved had the Acuris Transaction been consummated on the date or for the period indicated and do not purport to indicate
results of operations as of any future date or for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information
addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent our actual financial position or results of operation.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and the accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with
the Historical Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

____________________

(1) The pro forma combined statement of comprehensive loss has been prepared in a manner consistent with the accounting
policies of the Parent Guarantor as of September 30, 2021. The accounting policies adopted by Acuris in the Acuris FY
2020 Financial Statements were consistent with those adopted by the Parent Guarantor in the FY 2020 Financial
Statements and no adjustments were required in order to align the accounting policies of the Parent Guarantor and Acuris.

(2) On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris
Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of
share-for-share exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from the
first date that the companies came under common control, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially
owned the shares. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values
of the transferred companies and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each
subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account
of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other Reserves.”

_______________________

(i) The cost of two fixed-term management incentive plans, one of which relates to Dealogic and is in effect
until the end of the 2022 fiscal year, and one which relates to Acuris and is in effect until the end of the
2023 fiscal year. Pay-outs under these management incentive plans are contingent on the achievement of
certain EBITDA targets and are therefore not certain to be paid. We have made pay-outs under these
plans in each fiscal year since each plan was in effect; we believe that it is likely, based on our current
performance, that partial or full amounts under each plan will be paid during each fiscal year until
termination of the plans and we currently do not have a new management incentive plan set up to replace
the current one upon its termination.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the cost amounted to $18.3 million, of which $6.3 million
was incurred by Dealogic and $12.0 million was incurred by Acuris. For the nine months ended September
30, 2021, the cost amounted to $19.0 million, of which $7.5 million was incurred by Dealogic and $11.5
million was incurred by Acuris. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the cost amounted to
$25.4 million, of which $9.6 million was incurred by Dealogic and $15.8 million was incurred by Acuris.

(ii) Share option expense of $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and $9.7 million for
the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, recognized upon the departure of former senior
management following our acquisition of the Dealogic Group.

(iii) Severance costs associated with headcount reduction, of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2020, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $1.4 million relates to Acuris; $1.3 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2021, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $0.9 million relates
to Acuris; and $1.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, of which $0.4 million relates
to Dealogic and $0.9 million relates to Acuris.

(iv) Executed Acuris and Dealogic headcount reductions occurring during the year, i.e. “headcount actioned
not yet cash.” “Actioned not yet cash” are cost savings that had been fully actioned by the relevant period
end but not yet been realized for the period (i.e., the amount represents the incremental cost savings that
would have been realized if they had been actioned on the first day of the relevant period).

(v) One-time non-recurring bonuses incurred by Acuris in respect of a 2018 acquisition, of $0.04 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 and $0.5 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

(b) “Other expenses” primarily relate to $0.6 million of rent costs for duplicative office space where the lease has been
terminated or the space has been sublet (net of IFRS 16 gain on sub lease) and professional fees.

-----

(5) “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA divided by
revenue.

(6) “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA after giving effect to certain synergies and cost savings. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize any
of these synergies or cost savings, and the costs we incur in trying to realize these synergies may outweigh the benefits.
The addbacks in the table below include an aggregation of standalone Dealogic and Acuris synergies, to which we have
applied additional combination adjustments in a net aggregate amount of $2.8 million relating to synergies that are identified
to be actioned and that we believe will be realizable in connection with the combination of Dealogic and Acuris.

The reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 is as
follows:

**Twelve months ended September 30,**

Other items[(f)] ................................................................................................................... 100
**Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) ................** **360,266**

_______________________

(a) “ACV adjustment” is the incremental revenue that we would have realized had all net new subscription contracts
acquired during the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 been effective on October 1, 2020.

(b) “Headcount- and staff-related cost savings” primarily relate to direct savings from the reduction of employees and
contractors, based on the organization size and fully-loaded compensation cost goals that we expect to achieve.
These costs are “identified to be actioned” and relate to cost savings that had been identified but not yet actioned
by September 30, 2021.

(c) “IT-related cost savings” primarily relate to rationalization and consolidation of cloud platforms, business
applications, data centers and connectivity vendors. We have also considered better pricing through vendor
renegotiations, leveraging the ION Group’s larger scale.

(d) “Office-related cost savings” relate to the consolidation of office space across the ION Group companies.

(e) “Professional fees and other” relate to (i) $25.6 million of fees and charges incurred during the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021 for one-time integration services (e.g., synergy/cost savings consulting and evaluation,
software implementation services, data migration, project management and commercial contract review, HR
process integration and cost advisory) from third parties including the ION Group strategic management team,
whose services relating to certain post-acquisition advice are charged to us at arm’s length rates, and cost savings
from consolidating one-time group support functions (finance, HR, audit, tax, systems) provided as we further
consolidate central systems, functions and reduce the requirement for group support functions going forward and
(ii) $2.7 million cost savings initiatives related to reduction of fees and expenses to external advisors and vendors.

(f) “Other items” include $0.1 million of adjustments consisting of professional fees and other costs related to
implementing one-off projects for Dealogic’s top 50 customers.

(7) “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) divided by revenue.

(8) “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including Backstop)” is calculated as Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition, using
estimated adjusted EBITDA of Backstop for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $5 million, as adjusted for $13 million
of pro forma synergies expected to be achieved in the next 24 months. The reconciliation of Pro Forma Combined EBITDA
(with Combination Synergies including Backstop) to Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies)
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 is as follows:

**Twelve months ended September 30,**
**2021**

**(unaudited)**

**($ in thousands)**
**Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) ................** **360,266**
Backstop Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA .......................................................................... 18,011
**Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including**
**Backstop) ..................................................................................................................** **378,277**

(9) “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies including Backstop)” is calculated as Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including Backstop) divided by pro forma revenue
reflecting the Backstop Acquisition.

(10) “As adjusted pro forma combined total debt” is defined as total debt as of September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined
basis, as adjusted for the offering of the New Notes as if it had occurred on September 30, 2021.

(11) “Net debt” is defined as total debt, less cash at bank and in hand. “As adjusted pro forma combined net debt” is defined as
net debt as of September 31, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis, as adjusted for the offering of the New Notes as if it
had occurred on September 30, 2021 and calculated using $91.9 million of cash at bank and in hand as of January 19,
2022 (which was $69.9 million) after giving pro forma effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom. See
“Capitalization.” The most recent cash position has been included in order to help investors understand that our cash at
bank and in hand as of January 19, 2022 was higher than as of September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of cash inflows
from increased invoicing of customers during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to other periods of the year.

(12) “As adjusted pro forma combined finance cost” is defined as our interest expense on borrowings for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis, as adjusted for the offering of the New Notes and the use of
proceeds therefrom as if they had occurred on September 30, 2020. For further information, see “Use of Proceeds,”
“Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the New Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with_
_other information provided to you in this Offering Memorandum, in deciding whether to invest in the New Notes. The occurrence_
_of any of the events discussed below could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and_
_financial position. If these events occur, the trading prices of the Notes could decline, we may not be able to pay all or part of the_
_interest on, or the principal amount of, the Notes and you may lose all or part of your investment. Prospective investors should_
_note that the risks described below are not the only risks we face. We have described only those risks relating to our operations_
_of which we are aware and that we believe to be material. There may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be_
_material or of which we are unaware._

_This Offering Memorandum contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ_
_significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include those_
_discussed below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See “Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We may be adversely affected by uncertainty, downturns and changes in the general economy of the markets that we_**
**_serve._**

We operate in a dynamic environment that is rapidly shifting due to innovation in technology, evolving and increasing global
regulation, information proliferation and a generation of new users. While we believe that we operate in attractive markets, our
performance depends in large part on the financial health and strength of our customers, which in turn is dependent on the general
economies of the countries in which they operate.

The COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken to attempt to contain and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including stay-at-home, business closure and other restrictive orders, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior, have
impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers and have created significant
uncertainty in the markets in which we operate. It is difficult to accurately predict what further effects these conditions and measures
will have on our future business and results of operations. The degree to which the pandemic impacts our future business and
results of operations will depend on developments beyond our control, including the ongoing severity of the pandemic, the pace of
vaccination in various countries in which we operate, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions
can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic. We cannot assure you
that the fallout from various governments’ attempts to contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide will not have material
consequences for the holders of indebtedness, including the Notes. This pandemic or any similar event could affect the timing of
customer purchases and payments, the timing of our customer projects as well as the overall demand for our products and services,
which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

The spread of COVID-19 may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic activity and may lead to prolonged periods
of economic uncertainty, downturn, recession or depression in the countries in which we and our customers operate, which would
adversely affect the demand for our products and services. The spread of COVID-19 may also cause other unpredictable or
negative events which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial position. A continued global economic
uncertainty and downturns in the financial services in one or more of the regions in which we operate could adversely affect our
business, financial position and results of operations. Any future epidemics may also have similar, or more severe, effects on global
economic activity and on our business, results of operations or financial position.

**_We derive most of our revenues from customers in the financial industry and our business, financial position and results_**
**_of operations could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry as well as consolidation amongst our_**
**_customers._**

We are highly dependent on the financial industry from which we derive most of our revenue. Adverse economic conditions and
uncertainties, including any fines or penalties on financial institutions and any potential resulting failures or consolidations of
financial institutions, may adversely affect us by significantly reducing our client engagements. In addition, the financial services
sector is often subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, consolidation among firms, increasing capital requirements, lower
transaction volumes in certain markets and asset classes and relatively low overall anticipated market growth. These
characteristics often lead to periods of reductions in costs and reduced supplier spending in the industry. While increased and
more complex regulatory requirements have caused many financial institutions to increase their spending on compliance and riskrelated matters, which can benefit our business, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future. In addition,
we can provide no assurance that the ongoing adverse economic impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will not result
in similar constrictions in client engagements. See “—We may be adversely affected by uncertainty, downturns and changes in the


-----

_general economy of the markets that we serve.” Any changes in the volume of business derived from clients active within the_
financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

**_We operate in competitive markets and may be adversely affected by this competition._**

The markets in which we operate are competitive and are subject to rapid technological changes and evolving customer demands
and needs. Some of these competitors are established companies that have substantial financial resources, recognized brands,
technological expertise and market experience and these competitors sometimes have more established positions, and could have
more customers, in certain segments and regions than we do.

To better serve the needs of their existing customers and to attract new customers, our competitors may continue to:

� enhance and improve their content, software and services (such as by adding new content and functionalities);

� develop new offerings and services;

� compete aggressively on price;

� invest in technology; and

� acquire additional businesses and partner with other businesses in key sectors that will allow them to offer a broader
array of software and services.

Important differentiating factors in our industry include technological capabilities, quality and breadth of content, ability to obtain
and publish critical intelligence and breaking news ahead of others, user-friendliness of customer interface and ability to recruit
and retain talented employees. Our competitors may also seek to differentiate themselves from the breadth of our offerings by
being specialized, with a narrower focus than we have. As a result, they may be able to adopt new or emerging technologies,
provide more specialized data, content and intelligence or address the requirements of certain customers more quickly than we
can. New and emerging technologies can also have the impact of allowing start-up companies to enter the market more quickly
than they would have been able to in the past.

Some of our competitors may also decide to aggressively market their offerings as a lower cost alternative and offer price incentives
to acquire new business. As some of our competitors may offer products and services that may be viewed as more cost effective
than ours or which may be seen as having greater functionality or performance than ours, the relative value of some of our products
and services could be diminished.

Competition and cost-cutting initiatives may require us to make commercial concessions, including discounting or adjusting list
prices (which may result in lower revenues), or make additional capital investments to further enhance the functionality of our
products (which might result in lower profit margins). If we are unable or unwilling to reduce prices or make additional investments
for some of our products in the future, we may lose customers and our business, financial position and results of operations may
be adversely affected. Some of our current or future products could also be rendered obsolete as a result of competitive offerings
and new technologies.

If we fail to compete effectively, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.

**_Alternative sources of data or increased accessibility to free or relatively inexpensive information and software sources_**
**_may reduce demand for our products and services._**

In recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the
Internet, and this trend is expected to continue. For example:

� some governmental and regulatory agencies have increased the amount of information they make publicly available at
no cost;

� several companies and organizations have made certain financial and other information publicly available at no cost;
and

� “open source” software that is available for free may also provide some functionality similar to that in some of our
products.

Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information and software may reduce demand for our products and services.
Additionally, we source some of our information and research from third-party providers. There is a risk that these providers (or
their third-party providers of data) could make data available directly to end users, thereby undercutting us. Our business, financial
position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by such alternative sources of data.

**_Consolidation of customers, as well as cost-cutting across our customer base, could impact our available markets and_**
**_revenue growth._**

Our business has a customer base which is largely comprised of diversified corporates, financial institutions, private equity firms
and advisors. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in
reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can result in losses of contracts or impact the size of our customer base.

Customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. Cost-cutting,
reduced spending or reduced activity by any of our customer industry sectors may decrease demand for, and usage of, some of
our products. This could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations by reducing our revenues, which
could in turn reduce the profitability of some of our products.

Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on our products and services by consolidating
their spending with fewer providers, including by selecting other providers with lower-cost offerings. If customers elect to
consolidate their spending on our products with other providers and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if
customers elect to internally develop their own products, our business, financial position and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

**_Delayed payments or non-payments by our customers could adversely affect us._**

Our ability to receive payment for the products and services we sell depends on the continued existence and creditworthiness of
our customers. We may experience a higher than normal level of delayed payments or non-payments by our customers if their
economic conditions are weakened, which could negatively impact our working capital as our trade payables may remain
outstanding for a longer period of time. As of December 31, 2020, our provision for bad debts was $2.6 million on a pro forma
combined basis. Should the global economy experience economic volatility or tightening credit markets, including as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk that we may not be able to collect payments on a timely basis from our customers could increase.
Further, a deterioration of global economic conditions could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers.
Accordingly, if we underestimate the amounts needed for our bad debt provision or if our customers delay or fail to pay a significant
amount of our outstanding receivables, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely
affected. Delayed payment or non-payment by our customers, or requests for payment in advance by our suppliers, could have a
material adverse effect on our cash flow and on our business, results of operations and financial position.

**_If we are unable to invest in, and develop, new software, services, applications and functionalities to meet our customers’_**
**_needs, attract new customers and retain existing ones and identify areas of higher growth, our business, financial_**
**_position and results of operations may be adversely affected._**

Our strategies involve, among other things, developing new software, services, applications and functionality in a timely and costeffective manner to meet our customers’ needs, anticipating and responding to industry trends and technological changes and
maintaining a strong position in the industry sectors that we serve. We are subject to rapid technological change, change in usage
patterns, change in customer preferences and the emergence of new regulations and practices. To remain competitive, we must
continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and reliability of our software and applications. We are
continually seeking to improve the customer experience and our sales and marketing expertise.

We continue to review and allocate more resources and increase investments in opportunities in our portfolio of software and
applications that we believe have the highest potential for strategic growth. There is no assurance that we will be successful in
increasing our overall revenue growth in the future.

Disruptive and new technologies also create a need to adapt rapidly to the shifting landscape and we may not be in a position to
adapt quickly enough or at all.

We may also face unexpected challenges in mitigating the risks associated with developing new software and implementing
process and technology improvements that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting management
time and energy from other businesses and potentially resulting in our business being disrupted for a period of time, as well as
additional commitments of financial resources.

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The market for our content, software and products may develop more slowly than we expect._**

The market for our content, software and products may not develop further, or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of
which could harm our business. Our business model continues to evolve, and we may not be able to compete effectively, generate
significant revenues or maintain profitability for our content, software and products. We incur expenses associated with the

36


-----

development and marketing of our content, software and products in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated
with them. We must therefore manage our costs effectively in order to maintain acceptable operating margins and returns on our
investment for our content, software and products.

**_We consider acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions from time to time. Our acquisitions may not_**
**_always be completed or, if completed, perform as expected. Our acquisition activities may consume a portion of our_**
**_management’s focus, increase our leverage and reduce our profitability._**

Our business has grown, in part, as a result of acquisitions. In September 2019, we acquired Selerity Inc. a technology provider
specialized in artificial intelligence solutions for analyzing unstructured data and content. Some of these acquisitions may be
transformative, such as our acquisition in February 2021, through an internal reorganization within the ION Group, of the Acuris
business, one of the world’s leading providers of financial news, intelligence and analysis. Other acquisitions we may make from
time to time are smaller, opportunistic expansions, such as the Backstop Acquisition.

We consider acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions, including material transactions, from time to time in order
to expand and enhance our product portfolio and customer base. As we seek to be disciplined, there can be no assurance that
we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment candidates on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, competition
for acquisitions in the market in which we operate is high, and may increase costs of acquisitions or cause us to refrain from making
certain acquisitions. We may also be subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities in
connection with acquisitions.

Future acquisitions may be large and complex, and we may not be able to complete them as planned or at all. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to negotiate the required agreements, overcome any regulatory hurdles and obtain the necessary
licenses, permits and financing for such acquisitions. Management resources may also be diverted from operating our existing
businesses to acquisition-related activities. Even if we are able to effectuate such transactions, the acquired businesses may not
perform as expected due to various factors, including risks specific to such business, the presence of liabilities unknown to us,
significant regulatory costs in foreign jurisdictions and other matters that may not have emerged during the diligence of the target
of such acquisition. Any such acquisition may also increase our leverage due to existing debt at the target of such acquisition or
new debt that we may incur to finance such acquisition. If such acquisitions do not perform as expected, our anticipated revenues
and profits may be lower and our profit margins and cash flow may be adversely affected.

Further, the intellectual property of an acquired business may also be an important component of the value that we agree to pay
for such a business. Acquisitions, however, are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property
that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent upon licenses from third parties, that the acquired
business infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others or that the technology does not have the acceptance in the
marketplace that we anticipated. If we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses’ intellectual property rights, our
business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.

**_We may have difficulty integrating our acquisitions with our existing operations._**

Whenever we make an acquisition, we are required to integrate the products and services, technology, administrative functions,
personnel and processes of the acquired businesses into our businesses. The integration of an acquisition may expose us to
certain risks, including:

� difficulty in integrating management information, accounting and financial control systems;

� unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisition;

� potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the acquired companies;

� difficulty in integrating any software acquired with our product portfolio; and

� difficulty in establishing of an effective management and operational team for the acquired business.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently and effectively integrate our acquisitions, including the Acuris Acquisition
or any businesses we may acquire in the future, and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of the business that we have acquired, or in the future may acquire,
we may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements from such acquisitions, either in
the anticipated amount or within the anticipated time frame, and the costs of achieving such benefits may be higher than, and the

37


-----

timing may differ from, the anticipated costs. Any such failure to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue
enhancements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.

**_The unaudited Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma_**
**_Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma_**
**_Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) and certain other financial information_**
**_presented in this Offering Memorandum are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties._**

The adjustments made to Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop), as applicable, annualizing the impact of certain cost saving
measures, including headcount and staff-related cost savings, IT and other office-related savings, as well as adjustments to add
ACV incremental revenue, ECM volume-based revenue, Tier 1 implementation costs, identified cost savings initiatives and
professional fees and other items, among others, should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. The
assumptions we have made with respect to Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other
(Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies)
and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) that we present in this Offering
Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may
cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon
assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters and our
anticipated ACV adjustments are based upon assumptions about our ability to retain customers. Our ability to achieve planned
cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including changes
in the markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory developments, and
tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect,
these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the
anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving measures. Additionally, cost saving measures generally require
a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have an adverse effect on our
ongoing business operations. These factors may offset the cost savings we anticipate and which we have included in our Pro
Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with
Combination Synergies Including Backstop). Consequently, our inability to realize our anticipated cost savings could have a
material adverse effect on our impact on our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other
(Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies)
and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) as presented herein.

Moreover, our EBITDA Metrics include an adjustment for assumed earnings from ECM deal volumes, in situations where deal
volumes in the ECM market for the period were below the most recent historical five-year average volumes. In line with the
calculation of “Consolidated EBITDA” provided under the Indentures and our Existing Credit Facility Agreement, this adjustment
smooths out the revenue impacts of periods in which transaction volume in the ECM market is lower than the most recent historical
five-year average volumes and allows us to add back the portion of earnings that would have been generated in that period if deal
volumes for the period had been in line with such historical five-year average volumes, but we do not make a corresponding
negative adjustment where ECM deal volumes in a given period are higher than such five-year average. Such revenue adjustments
assume revenue that was not realized and may not be realized in the future and are inherently subject to uncertainty.

**_auditors, consultants or experts, is subject to management estimates and should not be relied upon in isolation when_**
**_making an investment decision._**

Acuris International Limited was incorporated on April 18, 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited, the holding company
of the Acuris group on July 11, 2019. Therefore, the audited consolidated financial statements of Acuris International Limited for
the period ended December 31, 2019 cover the period from April 18, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

For purposes of facilitating the comparison of the results of operations of Acuris between 2019 and 2020, the “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this Offering Memorandum also presents a_
discussion of certain key line items of the results of operations of Acuris International Limited for the year ended December 31,
2020 based on the audited Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, as compared to the Acuris 2019 Unaudited Financial Information
prepared for illustrative purposes only. Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have audited,
reviewed, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to such management information and, accordingly, neither our
independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with

**_Unauthorized data access or other cyber-security or privacy breaches may cause some of our customers to lose_**
**_confidence in our security measures and could result in increased costs._**

Similar to other global companies that provide services online, we may experience cyber-threats, cyber-attacks and cyber-security
breaches, which can include unauthorized attempts to access, disable, use, modify or degrade our information, systems and
networks, and the data within, or the introduction of computer viruses and other malicious codes and fraudulent “phishing” e-mails
that seek to misappropriate data and information or install malware onto users’ computers.

Cyber-threats and breaches vary in technique and sources, and are caused by criminal hackers, purveyors of financial fraud,
hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance or error, among others. These threats
are persistent and increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect. While we have dedicated resources for
maintaining levels of cyber-security that we deem appropriate and we utilize third-party technology, products and services to help
identify, protect and remediate our information technology systems and networks against security breaches and cyber-incidents,
our measures may not be adequate or effective to prevent, identify or mitigate attacks by hackers or breaches caused by employee
error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Furthermore, given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used
to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems, such intrusions may be difficult to detect for periods of time. Although
we are not aware of any significant incidents to date, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations
could be disrupted or we may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties
because of lost or misappropriated information. While we maintain what we believe is sufficient insurance coverage to cover
certain aspects of third-party cyber-security claims and business interruption, our insurance coverage may not always cover all
costs or losses.

We are also dependent on security measures that some of our customers are taking to protect their own systems and infrastructure,
if they interface with our own systems and networks. For example, if a customer experiences a data security breach that results
in the misappropriation of some of the customer’s proprietary business information, our reputation could be harmed, even if we
were not responsible for the breach.

We collect, store, use and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable
information of our employees and customers on our networks. A number of our customers also entrust us with storing and securing
their own confidential data and information. Any malicious or accidental breach of our data security could result in unintentional
disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, third-party, customer, vendor, employee or other confidential or sensitive data or
information, which could potentially result in damage to our brands and reputation, costs to us to enhance security or to respond
to occurrences, lost sales, violations of privacy or other laws, penalties, fines, regulatory actions, investigations, sanctions, or
litigation, and/or loss of confidence in our security measures, which would harm our ability to retain and attract customers. Also,
media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred,
could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of
operations. If any of these were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_We rely heavily on our own and third-party telecommunications, data centers, network systems and the Internet and any_**
**_failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and could adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial position and results of operations._**

We deliver our software and services electronically and our customers depend on our and, in many cases, the relevant cloud
infrastructure provider’s, ability to receive, store, process, transmit and otherwise rapidly handle very substantial quantities of data
on computer-based networks. Our customers depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our telecommunications,
data centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including websites and the Internet. Our employees also depend on
these systems for our internal use. Interruptions or delays in these operations or services could result in financial loss, potential
liability, and damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results
of operations.

Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-attack, cyber-breach or interruption of our systems, including operational services, loss
of service from third parties, sabotage, break-ins, war, terrorist activities, human error, natural disaster, power or coding loss and
computer viruses, could cause our systems to operate slowly or could interrupt service for periods of time. Further, these
disruptions could materially and adversely impact the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we

39


-----

are located, including in cities worldwide in which we have offices. While we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans
that utilize industry standards and best practices, including back-up facilities for primary data centers, a testing program and staff
training, the systems are not always fully redundant and disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be
sufficient or effective. To the extent that our telecommunications, information technology systems or other networks are managed
or hosted by third parties, we would need to coordinate with these third parties to resolve any issues.

In particular, because many of our products and services play a mission-critical role for our customers, any damage to, or failure
of, the infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our
customers in a timely manner, which could harm our reputation and result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or
reduced business from current customers.

Our ability to effectively use the Internet may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet
providers or increased government regulation. These events may affect our ability to store, process and transmit data and services
to our customers.

**_Higher staff costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations._**

Staff costs comprise a significant portion of our operating expenses, representing 47.4% of our operating expenses for the year
ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma combined basis. Our staff costs may rise in the future as a result of workforce activism,
salary increases, headcount increases, government decrees and changes in social and pension contribution rules implemented to
reduce government budget deficits or to increase welfare benefits to employees. We may not manage to offset the increase in
staff costs through productivity gains or other measures. If staff costs increase further, our operating expenses will increase and
we may be unable to recover these increased expenses from our customers through increased selling prices or offset them through
productivity gains or other measures, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of
operations.

**_If we do not effectively recruit, train, manage and retain our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or_**
**_increase sales to our existing customers._**

There is significant competition for sales personnel with the advanced sales and execution skills and technical knowledge we need.
We believe that selling software licenses requires particularly talented sales personnel. Our ability to achieve significant growth in
revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training, managing and retaining sufficient numbers of
these talented sales personnel. New sales hires and reorganization of sales functions require significant management time and
training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. The uncertainty surrounding the timing to fully return to
a normal office environment, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, also increases the complexity of onboarding activities. As a result,
our new sales hires and planned sales hires may not become as productive as we would like or as quickly as we expect, and we
may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. Experienced sales personnel are particularly sought
after in our industry and we may have to expend significant resources to retain our most productive sales employees. Even with
considerable effort, we may be unsuccessful at retaining our experienced sales employees, which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Operating globally involves challenges that we may not be able to meet and that may adversely affect our ability to grow._**

For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a pro forma combined basis, U.S. & Canada, EMEA and APAC accounted for 40%,
42% and 18% of our revenue, respectively. In addition, we have employees in many cities globally.

We believe that there are advantages to operating globally, including a proportionately reduced exposure to the market
developments of a single country or region. However, there are certain risks inherent in doing business globally which may
adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. These risks include:

� difficulties in developing software that are tailored to the needs of local customers;

� economic slowdowns, instability and volatility in local markets and political instability of governments;

� lack of local acceptance or knowledge of our software, data and content products;

� lack of recognition of our brands;

� unavailability of local companies for acquisition;

� exposure to possibly adverse governmental or regulatory actions in countries where we operate or conduct business;

� higher inflation rates in the countries in which we do business;

40


-----

� the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on prices charged to local customers, notably when there is strengthening of the
U.S. dollar;

� changes in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions, including trade protection measures;

� dispersed control of our business operations;

� being subject to different laws and regulations (including those applicable in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in
the European Union);

� cultural and language differences; and

� managing compliance with varying and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations across the countries in which we do
business.

Adverse developments in any of these areas could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected results or, in case of
changes in the applicable laws and regulations, could impact our ability to continue to provide services to customers in that country.
Challenges associated with operating globally may increase for us as we continue to expand into regions and countries that we
believe present the highest growth opportunities. See “—If we are unable to invest in, and develop, new software, services,
_applications and functionalities to meet our customers’ needs, attract new customers and retain existing ones, and identify areas_
_of higher growth, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.”_

**_We generate a significant percentage of our revenues from recurring, subscription-based arrangements, and our ability_**
**_to maintain existing revenues and to generate higher revenues is dependent in part on maintaining a high customer_**
**_retention rate._**

For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis, approximately 90% (91% after giving effect to
the Backstop Acquisition) of our total revenues were recurring in nature and mostly derived from subscription licenses. As of and
for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis, our Weighted Average Contract Term was 2.26
years. Renewal dates are spread over the course of the year and across years. In order to maintain existing revenues and to
generate higher revenues, we are dependent on a significant number of our customers to renew their arrangements with us. As
we encourage new and existing customers to use a subscription-based license, we may become even more dependent on our
existing customers.

We may face pricing pressure, including at the time of renewal, in obtaining and retaining our customers due to pricing competition
or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by such customers. This may result in lower revenue from a customer
than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with such customer and our revenues could be lower despite a
significant number of our customers renewing their arrangements with us. This reduction in revenue could result in an adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, if our competitors are able to offer better customer
service and/or are more effective than us in promoting their products, they may be able, including through dedicated promotions
or other marketing activities, to cause the migration of some of our existing customers to their solutions, and we might be unable
to continue to attract new customers.

**_Any negative impact on the reputation of, and value associated with, our brand names could adversely affect our_**
**_business._**

Our brand names, including Dealogic, Acuris and the brands associated with each of our products (such as Mergermarket, Debtwire
or Xtract) represent an important business asset and our software portfolio consists of leading brands in their respective market
segments. We believe that the brand awareness, preference and loyalty that our end-customers exhibit for these brands are an
important competitive advantage. Any future negative perceptions of our brands could have an adverse effect on our reputation,
business, results of operation and financial position.

Our brand is partly based upon the trustworthiness and integrity of our content. The occurrence of events such as our misreporting
a news story, other errors in our content or analysis, the non-disclosure of a conflict of interest, the manipulation of a security by
one or more of our employees or content contributors, or any other breach of our compliance policies, could harm our reputation
for trustworthiness and reduce usership. In addition, in the event the reputation of any of our shareholders, directors, officers, key
contributors, writers or staff were harmed for any other reason, we could suffer as result of our association with the individual, and
also could suffer if the quantity or value of future services we received from the individual was diminished.

Maintaining the reputation of and the value associated with our brand names is important to the success of our business and there
can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this objective. Substantial erosion in the reputation of or value associated
with our brand names could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any

41


-----

adverse harm to the reputation or value of one of our brands could adversely affect our other brands and harm our relationship
with our customers.

In addition, we are also reliant on the “ION Analytics” brand, especially with new and prospective customers. Any adverse harm
to the reputation of or value associated with the “ION” brand, even if it does not related to us or our products, could affect the
reputation of and value associated with the “ION Analytics” brand and our other brands and consequently could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.

**_Failure to attract and retain skilled employees or senior management personnel could harm our ability to grow._**

Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain employees, including highly skilled technical personnel. Because
the development of our software requires knowledge of computer hardware, operating system software, system management
software and application software, our personnel must be proficient in a number of disciplines. Competition for such technical
personnel is intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

Our future growth will also require sales and marketing, financial, operational and administrative personnel to develop and support
new software, to enhance and support current software and to expand operational and financial systems. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our growth strategies and we may
experience certain constraints, or undergo certain organizational changes that could cause our employee attrition rate to increase,
either of which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion.

Our ability to maintain compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and to manage and monitor the risks facing our
business relies upon the ability to maintain skilled compliance, security, risk and audit professionals. Competition for such skillsets
is also intense, and our failure to hire and retain talented personnel could have an adverse effect on our internal control environment
and impact our operating results.

Our senior management team and our controlling shareholder have significant experience in our industry and the loss of this
leadership or shareholder support could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.
Further, the loss of this leadership or shareholder support may have an adverse impact on senior management’s ability to provide
effective oversight and strategic direction for all key internal functions, which could impact our future business, financial position
and results of operations.

**_We rely on third-party providers and other suppliers for a number of services that are important to our business, including_**
**_through certain outsourcing arrangements. An interruption or cessation of an important service supplied by any third_**
**_party, could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations._**

We depend on a number of suppliers, such as online service providers, hosting service and software providers, data processors,
software and hardware vendors, banks, local and regional utility providers, and telecommunications companies, for elements of
our software and other systems.

We work with outsourced providers, consultants and freelancers for certain functions such as product development, editorial and
research services, in order to leverage specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies. Outsourcing these functions involves
the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable
results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to
perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could
result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.

Outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical,
technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data. Failure of these third
parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that
could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.

We also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the
maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality including third-party cloud infrastructure. Our cloud
infrastructure providers, or other service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyberattacks, adverse changes to financial position, bankruptcy or other adverse conditions, which could impact our reputation and have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Design defects, errors, failures or delays associated with our software and products could negatively impact our_**
**_business._**

Despite testing, the software and products that we develop, license or distribute may contain errors or defects when first
released/launched or when major new updates or enhancements are released that cause the software or other products to operate
incorrectly or less effectively. We may also experience delays while developing and introducing new software and products for
various reasons, such as difficulties in adapting to particular operating environments. Defects, errors or delays in our software and
products that are significant, or are perceived to be significant, could result in rejection or delay in market acceptance, damage to
our reputation, loss of revenue, a lower rate of license renewals or upgrades, diversion of development resources, product liability
claims or regulatory actions, or increases in service and support costs. We may also need to expend significant capital resources
to eliminate or work around defects, errors, failures or delays. In each of these ways, our business, financial position and results
of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

**_We may be adversely affected by new legislation and guidance as well as changes in legislation and regulation, which_**
**_may affect how we provide software and how we collect and use information._**

As a global enterprise, we face an increasingly complex regulatory environment with regard to cyber-security, privacy and data
protection issues, which may impact our business, including increased risk, costs, and compliance obligations. Laws relating to
electronic and mobile communications, privacy, data security, data protection, anti-money laundering, e-commerce, direct
marketing and digital advertising have also become more prevalent and developed in recent years. As our business grows, the
potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on our business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. Further, the
exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and actions of the U.S. federal government have created some legal
uncertainties and it is difficult to predict in what form laws and regulations will be adopted, changed or repealed, how they will be
construed by the relevant courts, or the extent to which any changes might adversely affect us.

In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, use and transmit certain types of information that are subject to an increasing
number of different laws and regulations. In particular, data security and data protection laws and regulations that we are subject
to often vary by jurisdiction and various U.S. state regulations. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving. For example,
in May 2018, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) became fully effective and replaced the existing European Union Data Protection
Directive. The GDPR introduced more restrictive provisions on personal data processing, requiring companies to satisfy new
requirements regarding the handling, use and protection of personal data and sensitive personal data, and the ability of persons
whose data is stored to access, correct or delete it. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to
€20.0 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well
as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative
publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may
harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. We are also subject
to data localization laws in certain countries, which require us to store and process certain types of data within a particular country.

Existing, new and proposed legislation and regulations, including changes in the manner in which such legislation and regulations
are interpreted by courts, may:

� impose limits on our collection and use of certain kinds of information and our ability to communicate such information
effectively to our customers;

� increase our cost of doing business or require us to change some of our existing business practices;

� require us to provide solutions to our customers’ regulatory concerns, such as hosting their data in specific jurisdictions;

� hamper our ability to have uniform global policies with respect to certain matters, such as data security and anti-corruption
compliance; and

� conflict on a global basis (such as any differences between the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act,
and similar laws).

Although we have implemented policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations, we could be subject to penalties as well as reputational harm for any violations.

**_We have not historically operated as a combined company, and the Historical Financial Statements presented in this_**
**_Offering Memorandum are not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a combined_**
**_company._**

On November 14, 2017, the Parent Guarantor was incorporated in England and Wales. On December 21, 2017, it acquired a
controlling interest in Diamond Topco Limited and its subsidiaries, including the Dealogic group of companies and, on February
16, 2021, the Parent Guarantor, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, completed the Acuris Acquisition. As a
result of the above, our Historical Financial Statements are not necessarily representative of the results that we would have
achieved as a combined entity, are not directly comparable across the periods presented and may differ significantly from our
future performance. In particular, the Historical Financial Statements include the Parent Guarantor’s financial statements for the
years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 and Acuris International Limited’s financial statements for the period ended
December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2020. Consequently, the operations that the Parent Guarantor have carried
out historically do not materially represent the expected future operations of the Group and its historical financial statements are
not indicative of what the operating performance of the Group would have been if we had completed the Acuris Acquisition as of
an earlier date. As a result, it is difficult to identify relevant trends in the Historical Financial Statements. Furthermore, because
Acuris International Limited’s financial statements for the period ended December 31, 2019 do not show a full year of financial
information, they are not comparable to the company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements reflect the results of the Group, including Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris
Finance US, Inc., from the first date that the companies came under common control, and not from the date that the Parent
Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Factors Affecting Comparability
_of our Results of Operations—Effect of Common Control Reorganization.” Investors should exercise due caution when reviewing_
the Historical Financial Statements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations.”_

**_The unaudited pro forma combined financial and other information included herein does not necessarily reflect what our_**
**_results will be going forward or would have been historically had the Acuris Acquisition taken place as of a previous date_**
**_and such information should be read in conjunction with the Historical Financial Statements._**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain unaudited pro forma combined financial information and certain key operating metrics,
which comprise an unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive income of the Parent Guarantor for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021, which gives pro forma effect to the Acuris Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been derived from (i) the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements,
(ii) the FY 2020 Financial Statements and (iii) the Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, and certain pro forma adjustments have
been made thereto, inter alia, to eliminate transactions which were historically made between entities, which are fellow subsidiaries
of the Parent Guarantor as a result of the Acuris Acquisition, and would therefore have been subject to intercompany elimination.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information is based on the FY 2020 Financial Statements and the Unaudited
Interim Financial Statements, with unaudited adjustments to illustrate the pro forma effect of the Acuris Acquisition. The Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and the accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with the Historical
Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to indicate what the performance
of our Group would have been had the Acuris Acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020, nor is it intended to be a projection of our
future results. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information should not be considered in isolation or be used as a
substitute for an analysis of the historical operating results of the Acuris group. For further information, see “Presentation of
_Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined_
_Financial Information.”_

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended
to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act. Neither
the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards. Any reliance you place on this information should fully take this into consideration.

**_Currency and interest rate fluctuations and volatility in global currency markets may have a significant impact on our_**
**_reported revenues and earnings._**

Our financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and are, therefore, subject to movements in exchange rates on certain costs
and revenues that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. We receive revenues and incur expenses in many currencies and are
thereby exposed to the impact of fluctuations in various currency rates. Foreign currency movements have been volatile over the
last three years and such volatility may continue in the future.

44


-----

Exchange rate movements in our currency exposures may cause fluctuations in our consolidated financial results. If our operations
outside of the United States expand, we expect these fluctuations to increase. In particular, we have exposure to the euro and
British pound sterling.

Some of our debt service requirements are denominated in euro and, following the issuance of the New Notes, will continue to be,
and with respect to the Euro Notes, will be denominated in euro even though the majority of our cash flow from operations is
generated in U.S. dollars. Significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro could have a material adverse
effect on our financial position and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on euro-denominated debt.

We monitor the financial stability of the foreign countries in which we operate. Global markets continue to experience uncertainty,
and external events have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates. If global economic
and market conditions, or economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States or other key markets
remain uncertain or deteriorate further, global credit markets may further weaken. Events that affect the global currency markets
could in turn adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.

**_Tax matters, including changes to tax laws, regulations and treaties, could impact our business, financial position and_**
**_results of operations._**

We operate in many countries worldwide and our earnings are subject to taxation in many different jurisdictions and at different
rates. Changes in tax laws and regulations, international treaties and tax accounting standards and/or uncertainty over their
application and interpretation as well as changes in the geographical mix of our profits may adversely affect our results (notably
our income tax expense) and our effective tax rate. Additionally, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based
taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value added, property, withholding and franchise taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign
jurisdictions.

We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other taxing
authorities with respect to such income and non-income-based taxes inside and outside of the U.S. If the IRS or another taxing
authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Payment of such
additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations
and financial position.

We are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations
worldwide. Changes in legislation, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions
where we are subject to taxation could impact our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.
In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, on
March 27, 2020, then President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act,
which included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including
temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters.
Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial position or results of
operations.

Additionally, longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border activities are evolving.
For example, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (“BEPS”) currently being undertaken by the G20 and the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development reflects concern about what is considered to be the inappropriate shifting of profits
from high tax jurisdictions to low tax jurisdictions; this could impact on the geographical mix of our profits going forward.

Partly in response to the BEPS initiative, the European Union Commission early in 2016 issued a seven-part Anti-Tax Avoidance
Package (“ATAP”). Part of the ATAP includes an Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (“ATAD”), which received political agreement from
the Member States in June 2016. Further, as part of the ATAD member states are required to introduce, among other measures,
a general anti-abuse rule. Tax changes arising from BEPS and/or the ATAD, which, in the case of the ATAD, with certain
exceptions, became effective in 2019 may create further limits on deductions available for intercompany transactions; it is also
possible that Member States could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest or levy withholding taxes where none
were levied previously. Given the uncertainty surrounding some of the changes and their potential interdependency, it is difficult
to assess the overall impact that these changes may have on our cash flow, which could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial position or results of operations.

**_We may face liability for content contained in our data products and services._**

We may be subject to claims for breach of contract, defamation, libel, copyright, patent or trademark infringement, fraud or
negligence, and other claims based on the nature, content or ownership of the material that we publish or distribute, in each case
relating to the data, articles, commentary, information or other content we distribute part of our content services. For example,

45


-----

investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that
we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees. We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for
the information we use in our published data. Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that
results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others. If the data or other
content or information that we distribute has errors or contains false or misleading information or information deemed to constitute
professional advice such as legal, financial or investment advice, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer. Use
of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed
by our clients, may pursue claims against us for significant amounts. Any such claim, even if the outcome were ultimately favorable
to us, could involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources. Such claims and
lawsuits could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and
results of operations.

Additionally, we could be subject to claims by providers of publicly available data and information we compile from websites and
other sources that we have improperly obtained that data in violation of law or terms of use. We could also be subject to claims
from third parties from which we license data and information that we have used or re-distributed the data or information in ways
not permitted by our license rights. Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming
and could adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial position.

**_A failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of_**
**_others, could adversely affect our business._**

Our business is dependent on technology and other intellectual property (including trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents
and trade secrets) that we own or license from third parties. We rely on intellectual property laws and private contracts to protect
these rights. However, we cannot assure you that we will always be able to detect and/or prevent the infringement or
misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property by third parties. Moreover, we conduct business in some
countries where the extent of effective legal protection for intellectual property rights is uncertain and/or less than that afforded in
the United States. If we need to bring litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, this may cause us to incur significant
costs and consume significant legal and managerial resources, and we may not prevail in any such efforts. Any failure by us to
adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete
effectively, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

In addition, we may face allegations from time to time that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some
cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to avoid such infringement, and such licenses may not be available on reasonable
terms. If we are forced to defend against allegations of infringement, it may cause us to incur significant costs and consume
significant legal and managerial resources, regardless of whether we ultimately prevail. If we do not prevail in any such defense,
we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties to third parties, and/or to cease sales of our software while we
redesign our software to avoid the infringement. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial
position and results of operations.

**_Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent our competitors from offering similar software and data and content_**
**_products._**

The markets in which we operate are characterized by regular claims and related litigation regarding patents, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights. There is a potential risk that we could infringe the intellectual property rights of other parties. Accordingly,
other parties could assert infringements of intellectual property rights, including illegitimate ones, against us. Successful claims of
infringement, misuse or misappropriation by another party against us, could prevent us from using or marketing certain
technologies or products in certain countries or require us to pay licensing costs, make changes to our software or other intellectual
property, or litigate the scope or validity of patents in order to be permitted to sell our products. In addition, we could be liable to
pay fines or compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to make use of technology from other parties.
Any such outcomes, or the expenditure of time and resources to defend against such outcomes, could impair our ability to innovate,
develop, distribute and sell our current and planned products and services, which could materially impact our operations. In
addition, even claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation that ultimately are unsuccessful could cause reputational harm,
result in litigation costs and divert management’s time and other resources. Additionally, our intellectual property may not prevent
competitors from independently developing software or services similar to, or duplicative of, our software, and our competitors may
be able to do so without infringing our intellectual property rights. If such software or services do not infringe on our intellectual
property rights and such software or services achieve greater acceptance, or our competitors undertake more far-reaching and
successful software development efforts or marketing campaigns or adopt more aggressive pricing policies, this could materially
adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

-----

**_When using open-source software, defects in the open-source software or a claim by a third party as to ownership of_**
**_derivative software may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations._**

In our software and services we use open-source software, which are software where the source code is released based on a
license pursuant to which the holder of the copyright generally grants users the right to access, copy, modify and distribute the
underlying source code. Such broad rights are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions
on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original license
terms. Two main risks are generally associated with using open-source software. First, the open-source software license usually
also covers onward distributions of derivative works, with the result that proprietary software integrated with the open-source
software becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (open-source software and proprietary software
components) is covered by the open-source software license. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the
derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The
second risk is that open-source software is usually licensed “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, we would bear
the risks in the event of defects with any open-source software that we utilize in our products and services without necessarily
having any contractual recourse. Further, if we integrate open-source software into any of our software, then our use of opensource software could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of
exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the open-source
software license. Moreover, it is possible to receive a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the
modifications of the source code performed on such software. This situation could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial position and results of operations.

**_Changes to our sales organization and other corporate functions can be disruptive and may negatively impact our results_**
**_of operations._**

From time to time, we make changes in our organizational structure in order to improve the effectiveness of our organization, which
may disrupt our operations and increase the risk of personnel turnover. Although the relationship with our personnel throughout
this process has remained generally positive, we cannot assure you that our restructuring and reorganization initiatives, as well as
any future initiatives that we might decide to implement to further enhance the efficiency of our sales and marketing team or other
corporate functions, will not result in the loss of valuable personnel or adversely affect the productivity of our sales force, which
could lead to revenue declines. In addition, turnover within our sales force can cause disruption in sales cycles, leading to delay
or loss of business. It can also take time to implement new sales management plans and to effectively recruit and train new sales
personnel.

Any such adverse changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_The sales and implementation cycles for many of our content, software and services can be lengthy and require_**
**_significant investment from both our customers and us. If we fail to close sales or if a customer chooses not to complete_**
**_an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial position and results of_**
**_operations may be adversely affected._**

The sales and associated deployment of many of our software or services often involve significant capital commitments by our
customers and/or us. Potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and
services and require us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating them prior to sales. Further, as part of the sale or
deployment of our software and services, customers may also require us to perform significant related services to complete a proof
of concept or custom development to meet their needs. All of the aforementioned activities may require us to expend significant
funds and management resources and, ultimately, the customer may determine not to close the sale or complete the
implementation. During the sales evaluation period, such potential customers may delay purchases, may decide not to purchase
and may scale down their requirements for reasons that we do not control and cannot predict, including:

� changes in economic conditions;

� changes in customer personnel;

� reduced demand for enterprise software;

� introduction of products by our competitors;

� seasonality of a customer’s IT purchases;

� lower prices offered by our competitors;

� changes in the budgets and purchasing priorities of our customers;

47


-----

� need for training of customer personnel; and

� changes in the information systems of our customers.

As a result of these factors, our revenue may be difficult to forecast, and we could experience variations in our results of operations
from quarter to quarter or year to year. The extended lengths of our selling cycles in relation to our customers may result in the
incurrence of significant time resources in pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenue. As a result of the
outbreak of COVID-19, our customers implemented increased measures requiring the approval of their senior management or
procurement for purchases and projects, which may have an adverse effect on the average length of our selling cycles in the
future. If we are unable to obtain contractual commitments after a selling cycle, maintain contractual commitments after the
implementation period or limit upfront expenses, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

**_Exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material_**
**_adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations._**

In the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are or may become defendants
in numerous legal proceedings, including related to employment matters, commercial matters, antitrust matters, defamation claims,
data protection claims and intellectual property infringement claims, and may be the subject of government and regulatory
proceedings, investigations and inquiries. We face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in
the future.

Regardless of the merit of legal actions and claims, such matters can be expensive, time consuming, or harmful to our reputation,
and in recognition of these considerations, we may engage in arrangements to settle litigation. Any of these proceedings,
investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters and inquiries, we cannot predict
the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate
what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide
assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we review the latest information available
and assess the potential outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial position, cash flows,
business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future
periods. Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on us and require the attention of senior management to an extent that
may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.

Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards
comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be
enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk
of successful litigations against us in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess
or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks,
and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We are subject to laws and regulations regulating our relationship with employees, including health and safety laws and_**
**_regulations, which could result in litigation, liabilities or cost increases._**

We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations regulating our relationship with employees in each of the jurisdictions in which
we operate, including health and safety laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with existing health and safety requirements, or
new, more stringent requirements applicable to us are imposed, we may be subject to monetary fines, civil or criminal sanctions,
third-party claims, or the limitation or suspension of our operations.

In addition, as part of our contingency plan for the COVID-19 pandemic, we have transitioned to a remote work environment trying
to maintain consistent service and response levels. If the restrictive measures adopted to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 are
lifted and our employees are allowed to go back to the office, we may be required to implement more stringent health and safety
measures in order to limit the risk of contagion from COVID-19 inside the office.

48


-----

Further, we may be subject to employee claims in the future based on, among other things, discrimination, including gender pay
discrimination, harassment and wrongful termination. These types of claims, as well as other types of lawsuits to which we may
be subject from time to time, can distract our management’s attention from our business operations. We have previously been
and in the future may be subject to these types of claims, and if one or more of these claims were to be successful, or if there is a
significant increase in the number of these claims, our business, financial position and results of operations could be adversely
affected.

Regardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert
time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity
resulting from these allegations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

We are exposed to risks in relation to compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations and economic sanctions programs.

Our operations are subject to laws and regulations restricting our operations, including activities involving restricted countries,
organizations, entities and persons that have been identified as unlawful actors or that are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed by
the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) or other international economic sanctions that prohibit us from engaging in trade or
financial transactions with certain countries, businesses, organizations and individuals. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (the “FCPA”) which prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of
obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment, and other laws concerning our international operations.
The FCPA’s foreign counterparts contain similar prohibitions, although varying in both scope and jurisdiction. We transact with
customers in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain
circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Any violations of these laws,
regulations and procedures could expose us to administrative, civil or criminal penalties, fines or restrictions on export activities
and other remedial measures and could also adversely affect our reputation.

**_Our ability to maintain customer satisfaction depends in part on the quality of our customer support._**

We believe that the successful use of our software requires a high level of support and engagement for many of our customers,
particularly our large customers. In order to deliver appropriate customer support and engagement, we must successfully assist
our customers in deploying and continuing to use our software, resolving performance issues, addressing interoperability
challenges with the customers’ existing IT infrastructure, and responding to security threats and cyber-attacks and performance
and reliability problems that may arise from time to time. The IT architecture of our contracted customers, particularly the larger
organizations, is very complex and may require high levels of focused support to effectively utilize our software. Because our
software is designed to be highly configurable and to rapidly implement customers’ reconfigurations, customer errors in configuring
our software can result in significant disruption to our customers. Our support organization faces additional challenges associated
with our international operations, including those associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages other
than English. Increased demand for customer support, without corresponding increases in revenue, could increase our costs and
adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_Antitrust/competition-related claims or investigations could result in changes to how we do business and could be costly._**

We are subject to applicable antitrust and competition laws and regulations in the countries where we have operations. These
laws and regulations seek to prevent and prohibit anti-competitive activity. From time to time, we may be subject to
antitrust/competition-related claims and investigations. Following such a claim or investigation, we may be required to change the
way that we offer a particular software, divest an asset or business or grant new licenses and if we are found to have violated
antitrust or competition laws or regulations, we may be subject to fines or penalties. Any antitrust or competition-related claim or
investigation could be costly for us in terms of time and expense and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial
position and results of operations.

**_The ION Group’s interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our customers or the holders of the Notes._**

The Parent Guarantor is a direct subsidiary of I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, which is owned by the ION Group. As our indirect
shareholder, the ION Group exerts significant influence over us and has the ability to control our business and affairs, including,
but not limited to, decisions with respect to:

� mergers or other business combinations;

� the acquisition of other entities or the acquisition or disposition of assets;

� transactions with other ION Group entities;

49


-----

� the issuance of additional debt or equity securities;

� our strategy; and

� our management.

Accordingly, the ION Group may vote, take other actions or make decisions that conflict with our or your interests. For example,
the ION Group could cause us, to the extent permitted by the Indentures, to make acquisitions that increase the amount of our
indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, to sell assets or to pay dividends or make other intercompany loans or payments
rather than make capital expenditures or otherwise use our funds for the benefit of our business, which may impair our ability to
make payments under the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the ION Group or any of its affiliates (other than the
Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and the Subsidiary Guarantors) has any responsibility under the Notes or the Indenture or has
undertaken any commitment to provide support in relation to the obligations under the Notes or the Indenture.

We also enter into transactions with the ION Group from time to time. While we believe that such transactions are entered are on
terms obtainable from third parties for similar products and services, we cannot assure you that any such transactions will ultimately
be on terms that are equivalent to transactions with third parties. Furthermore, while the Dollar Indenture provides and the Euro
Indenture will provide that any transactions with affiliates involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50 million shall be on
arm’s length terms (as determined in good faith by senior management or the board of directors of the Issuers or any parent
thereof), there is no requirement for any independent directors to approve such transaction.

In addition, the ION Group may make investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in
businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The ION Group may vote in a manner so as to restrict us from expanding
our business or entering into additional lines of business which may be related to the current or future operations of these
investments. Also, ION Group may pursue acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a result, those
acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. Furthermore, certain of our current or potential future customers may believe
the interests of the ION Group conflict with theirs which may impact our ability to attract and retain certain customers. So long as
the ION Group continue to indirectly own a significant amount of our outstanding voting equity, even if such amount is less than
50%, the ION Group will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions.

Certain of our management also support activities across the ION Group. If their roles with ION Group divert their time and energy
from their roles with us, it could have a material impact on our business.

**_If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results_**
**_or prevent fraud._**

Effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. While we believe
that we have adequate systems of internal controls and procedures, there can be no assurance that our policies will be followed
at all times or that our internal control procedures will effectively detect and prevent violations by one or more of our employees,
consultants, agents or partners of any applicable laws. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud could
harm our business. This risk could be increased as a result of our acquisitions. Certain entities that we acquired in the past have
not had, and entities that we may acquire in the future may not have, internal control procedures to the same standard as our
procedures and we cannot assure that we will be able to apply our internal controls and procedures to such entities in a reasonable
time after acquisition or at all. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or
amended from time to time, our financial statements may not accurately reflect our financial position.

**_The failure to sustain a good working relationship with employee representatives, including workers’ unions, could harm_**
**_our business._**

None of our employees currently belong to unions, although in some jurisdictions, our employees are covered by collective
bargaining agreements. There can be no assurance that more employees will not form or join unions in the future. An increase in
the number of our unionized employees could lead to an increased likelihood of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions.
Strikes and other labor action, as well as the negotiating of new collective bargaining agreements or wage negotiations, could
disrupt our activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. We cannot
predict the extent to which future labor disputes or disturbance could disrupt our operations, cause reputational or financial harm
or make it more difficult to operate our businesses.

**_Failure to comply with laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy, data protection and consumer marketing_**
**_practices, could adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to various laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to privacy and the collection and use
of personal data, as well as laws and regulations with respect to consumer marketing practices.

50


-----

Various laws and regulations govern the processing (including the collection, use, retention and sharing) and security of the data
we receive from and about our customers and individuals. Failure to protect confidential data, provide adequate notice of our
privacy policies or obtain required valid consent, for example, could subject us to liabilities. Existing privacy-related laws and
regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand
current or enact new laws regarding privacy and data protection. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation adopted
by the European Union imposes stringent data protection requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance and the
European Union’s forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation is expected to impose, with respect to electronic communications, stricter data
protection and data processing requirements.

In addition, various laws and regulations govern the manner in which we market our subscription products, including with respect
to subscriptions, billing and auto-renewal. These laws and regulations often differ across jurisdictions and continue to evolve.
These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers.

Existing and newly adopted laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) have imposed and may
continue to impose obligations that may affect our business, require us to incur increased compliance costs and cause us to further
adjust our advertising or marketing practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with our own posted policies, could result
in claims against us by governmental entities or others, negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our users. Each of
these potential consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Additionally, we intend to monetize our proprietary data sets to customers and other third parties in the future, in compliance with
GDPR and other relevant privacy and other regulations. In relation to such data products, we may be subject to claims for breach
of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, fraud or negligence, or based on other theories of liability, in each case relating
to the data, information or other content we distribute. Use of our products as part of the investment process creates the risk that
customers, or the parties whose assets are managed by our customers, may pursue claims against us for significant amounts.
Any such claim, even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us, could involve a significant commitment of our management,
personnel, financial and other resources. Such claims and lawsuits could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We may be required to recognize impairment charges relating to goodwill and other intangible assets that would reduce_**
**_our reported assets and earnings._**

Historically, we have recognized a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets in our consolidated financial
statements in connection with the acquisitions of various businesses. As of September 30, 2021, our total intangible assets were
$3,145.7 million, representing 93.8% of our total assets as of such date $3,354.4 million.

Our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually (or more frequently if specific events or changes
in circumstance indicate the possibility that value has been impaired) for impairment, and our goodwill is not subject to amortization.
With respect to intangible assets that are not amortized, an impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on
which the current carrying amount are based are not fulfilled and the recoverable amount of any cash generating unit is less than
our carrying amount.

When calculating value-in-use, we estimate the cash flows expected from a cash generating unit or a group of cash generating
units and determine the applicable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The impairment test is
performed using forecasted future growth rate of the revenue and the operating margin, taking into account the existing customer
base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion
of product and service offerings to the marketplace and specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the
future.

We may be required to record impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in the future in the event that such forecasts are
cut significantly. Such impairments may also result from, among other factors, (i) deterioration in performance, (ii) adverse changes
in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our business activities or affect the products and services we sell
and (iii) adverse changes in the applicable discount rate, due to changes in interest rates. Such circumstances could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position and results of operations.

**_We have funded, and expect to continue to fund, our activities through various funding sources. We have no assurance_**
**_that such funding sources will be sufficient to satisfy our obligations._**

We have historically funded our activities through issues of shares, operating cash flows, bank borrowings and other debt and we
expect that the proceeds of bank borrowings and other debt (including the Notes), current working capital and sales revenues will
continue to fund our existing operations and payment obligations. We have no assurance, however, that we will generate sufficient
cash flow to satisfy our obligations or that we will continue to have access to bank borrowings and other financings. If our capital

51


-----

requirements are greater than expected, or if our revenues are not sufficient to fund our operations, we may need to find additional
financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. This could in turn materially adversely impact our reputation and
our business, results of operations and financial position.

**Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial position, our ability to operate_**
**_our business, react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to_**
**_the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, pay our other debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt_**
**_payments._**

We are highly leveraged. As of September 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Offering, we would have had $2,312 million in total
debt, all of which would have been secured on Collateral. As of September 30, 2021, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries had no
indebtedness for borrowed money. See “Capitalization.”

The degree to which we will be leveraged following the consummation of the Offering could have important consequences to
holders of the Notes, including, but not limited to:

� making it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including debt service requirements under our outstanding debt, including
the Notes;

� increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;

� requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest
on, indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of such cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
product research and development, or other general corporate purposes;

� limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive environment and the industry
in which we operate;

� compromising our ability to capitalize on business opportunities and to react to competitive pressures, as compared to our
competitors, due to our high level of debt and the restrictive covenants in the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the
Indentures;

� causing potential or existing customers to not contract with us due to concerns over our ability to meet our financial obligations;
and

� limiting our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, business and our
ability to satisfy our debt obligations, including the Notes.

**_The Issuers are special-purpose finance companies dependent on cash flow from other members of the Group to be able_**
**_to make payments under the Notes._**

The Issuers are special-purpose finance companies without cash-generating assets, independent business operations or sources
of revenue. As a result, the ability of the Issuers to make payments on the Notes will be wholly dependent upon interest or other
payments they receive from the Parent Guarantor and certain of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries or other members of our
corporate group, subject to various restrictions under the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which such entities are organized or
located, including foreign exchange controls, tax restrictions and other legal restrictions.

Furthermore, any loans or advances by any member of the Group to the Issuers may be subject to various restrictions under the
laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which such entities are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate
benefit laws, foreign exchange controls, tax restrictions and other legal restrictions or otherwise under contractual arrangements
to which any such subsidiary is subject, or may become subject to in the future. See ‘‘—Our ability to generate cash depends on
_many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate the cash required to service our debt, including the Notes.”_
If the Issuers are not able to make payments on the Notes, holders of the Notes would have to rely on claims for payment under
the Guarantees, which are subject to the risks and limitations described herein. We cannot assure you that arrangements with our
subsidiaries will provide the Issuers with sufficient payments, distributions or loans to service scheduled payments of interest,
principal or other amounts due under the Notes. Any of the situations described above could adversely affect the ability of the
Issuers to service their obligations in respect of the Notes

52


-----

**_Restrictions imposed by the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the Indentures may limit our ability to take certain_**
**_actions._**

The Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the Dollar Indenture limit, and the Euro Indenture will limit, our flexibility in operating
our business. For example, these agreements restrict, or will restrict, the ability of the Parent Guarantor and certain of its
subsidiaries to, among other things:

� borrow money;

� pay dividends or make other distributions;

� create certain liens;

� make certain asset dispositions;

� make certain loans or investments;

� issue or sell share capital of the Parent Guarantor’s subsidiaries;

� guarantee indebtedness;

� enter into transactions with affiliates; or

� merge, consolidate or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

We cannot assure you that the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the
Indentures will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities
that may be in our interest. Any future indebtedness may include similar or other restrictive terms. In addition to limiting our
flexibility in operating our business, a breach of the covenants in the Existing Credit Facility Agreement or the Indentures, including
as a result of events beyond our control, could cause a default under the terms of our other financing agreements may result in an
event of default under, or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. If this were to occur, we can make no assurances that we would
have sufficient assets to repay our debt.

**_Our credit facilities contain financial covenants which we could fail to meet._**

We are subject to the certain financial covenants under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. In particular, the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement requires us to maintain a first lien net leverage ratio (i.e., ratio of total secured debt minus cash and equivalents
to EBITDA) no greater than 9.0x if drawings of the Revolving Credit Facility provided under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement
exceed $10.0 million. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

Credit facilities we may enter in the future may also require the Parent Guarantor and certain of its subsidiaries to satisfy specified
financial tests and maintain specified financial ratios and covenants regarding a minimum level of EBITDA to certain measures of
debt, a minimum level of EBITDA to interest expense and a maximum amount of capital expenditure, all as defined in such credit
facilities.

The ability of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and to meet these tests may be affected by
events beyond their control and we cannot assure you that they will continue to meet these tests. The failure of the Parent
Guarantor and its subsidiaries to comply with these ratios and meet these tests could lead to a default under these credit facilities
unless we can obtain waivers or consents in respect of any breaches under these credit facilities. We cannot assure you that
these waivers or consents will be granted. In the event of any default under these credit facilities, the lenders under these facilities
will not be required to lend any additional amounts to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries and could elect to declare all
outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, fees and other amounts due thereunder, to be immediately due and
payable. In the event of a default, the relevant lenders could also require us to apply all available cash to repay the borrowings or
prevent us from making debt service payments on the Notes, any of which would be an event of default under the Notes. If the
debt under our credit facilities, the Notes were to be accelerated, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay
such debt in full.

**_Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate the cash_**
**_required to service our debt, including the Notes._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on the Notes and to meet our other debt service obligations or refinance our debt depends
on our future operating and financial performance and ability to generate cash. This will be affected by our ability to successfully
implement our business strategy, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, technical and other factors

53


-----

beyond our control. If we cannot generate sufficient cash to meet our debt service obligations or fund our other business needs,
we may, among other things, need to refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, obtain additional financing, delay
planned acquisitions or capital expenditures or sell assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash
through any of the foregoing. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on
commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including the Notes.

**_Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt in the future, which may_**
**_make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes, and impair our ability to operate our businesses._**

The Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Any debt that we incur at our nonGuarantor subsidiary level would be structurally senior to the Notes, and other debt could be secured on the Collateral or other
assets or could mature prior to the Notes. Although, the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the Dollar Indenture contain, and
the Euro Indenture will contain, restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number
of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to the Parent Guarantor’s and its subsidiaries’ existing
debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. Increases in our total indebtedness could also lead to a downgrade
of the ratings assigned to the Group or the Notes, which could negatively affect their trading price. In addition, the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement does not and the Indentures will not, prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness
under those agreements.

**_The facilities under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement bear interest at floating rates. Such floating rates could rise_**
**_significantly, increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The facilities under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement bear interest at floating rates of interest per annum equal to LIBOR
and/or EURIBOR, as adjusted periodically, plus a spread. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future. To the extent
that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase, reducing our profit and cash
flow, including cash available for serving our indebtedness.

**_Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral._**

Under the terms of the Indentures, we will be permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may
be secured by the Collateral, including indebtedness that will be secured on a super priority basis.

As a result of the voting provisions set forth in the Intercreditor Agreement, under certain circumstances, the lenders under the
Existing Credit Facility Agreement and counterparties to certain hedging arrangements could have effective control of all decisions
with respect to the Collateral. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the collateral agent under the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement serves as a common security agent for the secured parties under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, certain
hedging obligations and the Notes. Subject to certain limited exceptions, the collateral agent under the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement will act with respect to such Collateral only at the direction of the “Controlling Claimholders” (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement). In the event that we incur indebtedness secured on a super priority basis, the holders of such
indebtedness may also become “Controlling Claimholders” to the extent the relevant provisions are on market-standard terms.

Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes will not have separate rights to enforce the Collateral
securing the Notes. In addition, the holders of the Notes will not be able to instruct the Security Agent, force a sale of Collateral or
otherwise independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the relevant security documents, unless they comprise
the Controlling Claimholders which are entitled to give such instructions. Disputes may occur between the holders of the Notes
and creditors under our Existing Credit Facility Agreement, counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or holders of any
permitted additional pari passu indebtedness as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with
respect to the Collateral. In such an event, the holders of the Notes will be bound by any decisions of the Controlling Claimholders,
which may result in enforcement action in respect of the Collateral for the Notes, whether or not such action is approved by the
holders of the Notes or may be adverse to such holders. The creditors under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, the
counterparties to certain hedging arrangements or the holders of certain other permitted additional indebtedness may also have
interests that are different from the interest of holders of the Notes and they may elect to pursue their remedies under the relevant
security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Notes to do so. See “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the Collateral._**

Under applicable law, a security interest in certain assets can only be properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain
actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the security. The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not

54


-----

be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to
perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, the Security Agent has no responsibility or obligation to perfect the liens on the Collateral.

Under Luxembourg law, contracts are formed by the mere agreement (consentement) between the parties thereto, subject to
specific requirements. Additional steps, however, are required to grant, perfect and enforce security interests against third parties.

Security interests such as pledges, and transfer of ownership as a security, granted on financial instruments, accounts and claims
are governed by the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the
“Luxembourg Collateral Law”). Pursuant to this law, a pledge is effected, not by transfer of title, but by a transfer of possession
of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights
over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets.

A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims and accounts, the Luxembourg
Collateral Law provides for a fictitious transfer of possession which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the
intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is achieved by the entry of the security interest in the register
of the relevant company. Dispossession of cash collateral or rights under contracts is achieved by the security interest thereon
being notified by the debtor/co-contractor or by the acceptance thereof by the debtor of such claims or the co-contractor.
Dispossession of accounts are achieved by the notification to, and acceptance by, the relevant account bank of the pledge.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard
to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. In addition,
a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the
existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker
(as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became
enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which come into force for
third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.

**_The Collateral securing the Notes is subject to obsolescence, impairment, and casualty risks._**

We maintain insurance or otherwise insure against certain hazards. There are, however, losses that may be not be insured. The
value of the assets that the Issuers and the other Guarantors own or lease serving as Collateral may be materially adversely
affected by depreciation and normal wear and tear or because of certain events that may cause damage to these properties. If
there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged Collateral, we cannot assure you that any insurance proceeds received by us
will be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the Notes, Notes Guarantees and the Existing Credit Facility.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations_**
**_under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

The Existing Dollar Notes and the Notes Guarantees with respect to the Existing Dollar Notes are, and on or around the Issue
Date, the New Notes and the Notes Guarantees with respect to the New Notes will be, secured by security interests in the Collateral,
which also secures the obligations under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement on a pari passu basis as described elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum. While we expect the Notes Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral to be granted for the
benefit of the New Notes on the Issue Date, we may require a brief period after the Issue Date to procure them. The Collateral
may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indentures, the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and
the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or
a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes.

The value of the Collateral that will secure the Notes and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, amongst other things, the ability to sell such Collateral in an orderly sale, the costs of
realization and any requirements to pay any of the proceeds to preferential creditors such as tax authorities and employees,
economic conditions where our business operations are located and the availability of buyers of such Collateral. The book value
of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Similarly, we cannot assure you that there will be a market for the
sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share
pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value if the relevant entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding.

**_It may be difficult to realize the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections
permitted under the Indentures and/or the Intercreditor Agreement. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the
Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety

55


-----

of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under
the laws of certain jurisdictions.

The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security
interests in Collateral. For example, under Luxembourg law and English law, the enforcement of a share pledge, whether by
means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the
consent of a third party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be
able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets,
and the value of the Collateral may decline significantly.

**_The security interests in the Collateral will be granted to the Security Agent rather than directly to the holders of the New_**
**_Notes. The ability of the Security Agent to enforce certain of the Collateral may be restricted by local law._**

The security interests in the Collateral that secure, or will secure, our obligations under the Existing Dollar Notes and the New
Notes, respectively, and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees have not been, and will not be, granted
directly to the holders of the Notes, but will instead be granted only in favor of the Security Agent. The Dollar Indenture provides
and the Euro Indenture will provide (in addition to the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce
such Collateral. As a consequence, holders of the New Notes will not have direct security interests in the Collateral and will not be
entitled to take independent enforcement action in respect of such Collateral, except through the Trustee, which will, subject to the
applicable provisions of the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement, provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of
such Collateral.

The appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law, (i) to the extent that the designation is valid
under the law governing such appointment and (ii) subject to possible restrictions, depending on the type of the security interests.
Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, a security interest (financial collateral) may be provided
in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party
beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined.
Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of
the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by
such law.

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Collateral (subject to Permitted Liens),_**
**_the collateral agent under the Existing Credit Facilities will initially control actions with respect to that Collateral pursuant_**
**_to the Intercreditor Agreement._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral are, with respect to the Existing Dollar Notes, and will be, with
respect to the New Notes, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by that Collateral on a
first-priority basis, subject to Permitted Liens, including the obligations under the Existing Credit Facilities. Under the Intercreditor
Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such Collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of
enforcement proceedings against such Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the security
agent under the Existing Credit Facilities until the earlier of (1) the date on which the Issuers’ obligations under the Existing Credit
Facilities are discharged or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures and acceleration of the
obligations thereunder, if the Notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority
lien on the Collateral (other than the Existing Credit Facilities and subject to Permitted Liens) and the Security Agent has complied
with the applicable notice provisions. Such date may be further delayed as long as (x) the agent under the Existing Credit Facilities
has commenced and is diligently pursuing the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or a material portion thereof or (y)
any grantor that has granted a security interest in relation to the Collateral is a debtor or with respect to any bankruptcy or similar
insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the Existing Credit Facilities, the right to direct the actions with respect to the
Collateral will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness
secured by a first lien on the Collateral. If the Issuers issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the
Notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the Notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness
would be next in line to exercise rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Security Agent. Accordingly, the Security
Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral.

In addition, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or
otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Notes on such Collateral will
be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then
outstanding first-priority obligations). The Collateral so released will no longer secure the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ obligations

56


-----

under the Notes and the related Notes Guarantees. The holders of the Notes will also waive certain important rights otherwise
available to secured creditors in a bankruptcy as the Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the trustee and the Security Agent from
objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to a proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is
secured by the Collateral or to the use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral
agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of
the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection.

Also, under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize
any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority
obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of firstpriority obligations and, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the
case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
among all the holders of first-priority obligations. Thus, there can be no assurances that under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
holders of the Notes would not be obligated to turn over to the other holders of the first-priority obligations any Collateral, proceeds
or payments they may receive.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the Collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that the lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will reveal any
or all existing liens on such Collateral. In some foreign jurisdictions, there is no official register of liens secured by entities over
their assets. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be significant, could rank prior to the liens securing the
Notes and the Notes Guarantees and could have an adverse effect on the ability of the Security Agent for the Notes to realize or
foreclose upon the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes_**
**_and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral securing the Notes will be released automatically, including,
without limitation:

� in the case of Collateral, in connection with any sale or other disposition to any third party of the property or assets constituting
collateral, so long as the sale or other disposition is permitted by the Indentures or to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or
any Restricted Subsidiary consistent with the Intercreditor Agreement;

� in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indentures, the release of
the property and assets of such Guarantor;

� in accordance with the “Amendments and Waivers” provisions of the Indentures;

� upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance of the Indentures under the captions “Description of the Dollar Notes—
_Defeasance” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Defeasance” or satisfaction and discharge of the Indentures as provided_
under the captions “Description of the Dollar Notes—Satisfaction and Discharge” and “Description of the Euro Notes—
_Satisfaction and Discharge”;_

� with respect to the property and assets securing the Notes, automatically if a security interest granted in favor of the Existing
Credit Facility Agreement, public debt or such other indebtedness that gave rise to the obligation to grant the security interest
over such property and assets is released (other than pursuant to the payment and discharge thereof); or

� in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement,” “Description of the Dollar Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security_
_Interest.”_

**_The Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries._**

The Guarantors are the only guarantors that will guarantee the Notes as of or around the Issue Date. Generally, claims of creditors
of a non-Guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings
of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity and any intercompany loans and by holders of the Notes under the
Notes Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or other
bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade
creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made

57


-----

available for distribution to its parent entity. As such, the Notes and each Notes Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated
to the creditors (including trade creditors) of our non-Guarantor subsidiaries for the Notes. As of and for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021, the Guarantors that will guarantee the Notes and the Existing Credit Facility Agreement represented 95% of
our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses), 84% of our revenue and
62% of our total assets, excluding consolidation adjustments.

**_Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_**
**_applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

The Guarantors will guarantee the Notes on a senior secured basis. Each Notes Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of
the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuers and certain Guarantors will secure the payment
of the Notes on a senior secured basis by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. There is no guarantee that
the value of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. However, the Dollar
Indenture provides and the Euro Indenture will provide for general limitation language to the effect that each Notes Guarantee and
each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a Security Document will be limited
to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed/secured by the relevant Guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate
obligations and exposure of the Guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee/ security interest
voidable or otherwise ineffective under Luxembourg, English and other applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes
Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses referred to in
the Indentures include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors
generally. For example, the granting of a guarantee by a Luxembourg company is subject to specific limitations and requirements
relating to corporate object (objet social) and corporate benefit (intérêt social). The granting of a guarantee by a company
incorporated and existing in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg must be permitted by the corporate object of the company and not
prohibited by the legal form of that company. In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of security
by a company has to be for its “corporate benefit.” For more information on the specific limitations under the applicable law of the
respective jurisdictions of incorporation of the Guarantors/security provider, see “Certain Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

**_Enforcing your rights across multiple jurisdictions may be difficult._**

The Parent Guarantor is an English company and the Issuers are U.S. and Luxembourg companies. In the event of bankruptcy,
insolvency or a similar event, proceedings could be initiated in any of these jurisdictions. Your rights under the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and the Security Documents will thus be subject to the laws of several jurisdictions, and you may not be able to
effectively enforce your rights in multiple bankruptcy, insolvency and other similar proceedings. Moreover, such multi-jurisdictional
proceedings are typically complex and costly for creditors and often result in substantial uncertainty and delay in the enforcement
of creditors’ rights.

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or Notes Guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy._**

Collateral pledged, or Notes Guarantees issued, after the Issue Date may be treated under bankruptcy law as if they were pledged
to secure, or delivered to guarantee, as applicable, previously existing indebtedness. Any future pledge of Collateral or issuance
of a Notes Guarantee in favor of the holders of the Notes or any future issuance of a Notes Guarantee in favor of the holders of
the Notes may be avoidable by the relevant pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by the
pledgor’s or guarantor’s trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or Guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the Notes
Guarantee, (2) the pledge and/or issuance of the Notes Guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the Notes to receive a
greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge and/or Notes Guarantee (as applicable) had not been given
and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or Guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the
perfection thereof and/or the issuance of the Notes Guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.
Accordingly, if the Issuers or any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection in the United States after the Issue Date and any
pledge of Collateral not pledged, or any Notes Guarantees not issued, on the Issue Date had been pledged or perfected or issued
(as applicable) less than 90 days before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such pledges or Notes Guarantees are
materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered on the Issue Date (even if the Parent
Guarantor’s Notes Guarantee issued on the Issue Date would no longer be subject to such risk). To the extent that the grant of
any such security interest and/or Notes Guarantee is avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the
security interest and/or Notes Guarantee (as applicable). Collateral pledged, or Notes Guarantees issued, after the Issue Date
may also be avoidable under the insolvency laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the relevant issuer or guarantor.

58


-----

**_The insolvency laws of Luxembourg and England and Wales may not be as favorable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws_**
**_and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes._**

The Luxembourg Issuer and certain Guarantors (including the Parent Guarantor and Holdings) are organized under the laws of
Luxembourg or England and Wales, respectively. The procedural and substantive provisions of the insolvency laws of these
countries may not be as favorable to creditors as the provisions of U.S. law. In the event that any one or more of the Luxembourg
Issuer, such Guarantors or security providers, any future guarantors or security providers or any other of our subsidiaries
experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although it is possible that the Luxembourg Issuer or
the foreign-incorporated Guarantors become debtors under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, it is also possible that in the
event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Luxembourg, England and Wales or in other
jurisdictions where the companies have their center of main interests. Such multijurisdictional proceedings may result in greater
uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to effectively
enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. For more information around the
specific insolvency laws of Luxembourg and England and Wales, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.”

Luxembourg Courts or bankruptcy administrators may not give effect to the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement.
With respect to the validity and enforceability under Luxembourg law of subordination provisions the Luxembourg courts would, in
order to assess the validity and enforceability of contractual subordination provisions, in principle turn to Luxembourg legal doctrine
and case law that admit the validity and enforceability of a provision whereby a party agrees to subordinate its claim to that of
another creditor, but may not be enforceable against third parties which are not party to the relevant agreement. The treatment of
turnover provisions in intercreditor arrangements in Luxembourg law has not been tested. It is possible that a turnover provision
(to which a Luxembourg entity is a party) will be characterized as a mere contractual mechanism (unless it takes the form of a
Luxembourg security right effective in the insolvency of a junior creditor). Where a junior creditor has been paid in priority over a
senior creditor, it is uncertain whether a senior creditor can claw back these amounts in the bankruptcy of a junior creditor.

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

The Luxembourg Issuer and some of the Guarantors, including the Parent Guarantor and Holdings, and their respective
subsidiaries are organized outside the United States. Some directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors are
non-residents of the United States. Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on
these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as some assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their
respective subsidiaries and those of their directors, managers and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you
may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S.
Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities
laws of the United States.

The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than
arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Luxembourg or England and Wales. There is, therefore, doubt as to
the enforceability in Luxembourg or England and Wales of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a
U.S. judgment in Luxembourg or England and Wales. In addition, the enforcement in Luxembourg or England and Wales of any
judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will
be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a Luxembourg or England and Wales court would have the requisite power
or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in Luxembourg or England and Wales on the basis of U.S.
securities laws violations.

**_We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required_**
**_as required by the Indentures._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Issuers would be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding Notes, at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have
sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuers to pay the purchase price of
the outstanding notes, including the Notes, or that the restrictions in our Existing Credit Facility Agreement, the Indentures, the
Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A
change of control may result in our other indebtedness being mandatorily prepaid and cancelled and may result in an event of
default under, or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a
default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from their
subsidiaries or from the Parent Guarantor to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a

59


-----

change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary
to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from
providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such
indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such
consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we
expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot
assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing.

In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales which are not reinvested, the Issuers will be required to offer to
purchase outstanding Notes at 100% of the principal amount (or if issued at a discount, 100% of the accreted value) thereof plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. The source of funds for any such purchase of the
Notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or
sales of equity. The Issuers may not be able to purchase the Notes upon such an asset sale offer because we may not have
sufficient financial resources at the time of such asset sale to make the required purchase of Notes, or because restrictions our
other indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the Notes. Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the Issuers may
not have sufficient financial resources to purchase the Notes and such other indebtedness that the Issuers would be required to
offer to purchase or that become immediately due and payable as a result. We may require additional financing from third parties
to fund any such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all.

Any such failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the respective Notes would constitute a default under the Indentures, as
applicable, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness.
See “Description of the Dollar Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the Euro Notes—Change of Control,” “Description of the
_Dollar Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales.”_

**_The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of_**
**_certain important corporate events._**

The change of control provision contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain
important corporate events, including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or other similar transaction involving us that may
adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if
they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined in the Indentures. Except as described under “Description of the
_Dollar Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Change of Control,” as applicable, the Dollar Indenture_
does not and the Euro Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Issuers to offer to repurchase or redeem the
Notes in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Indentures include a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person. Although there is a limited body of case
law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a
result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuers are required to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited._**

We cannot assure you as to:

� the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

� your ability to sell your Notes; or

� the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our
operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject
to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market
for the Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that
may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different investors and this may affect the extent to
which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may
have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Notes, regardless of our prospects and financial performance. As a result, there
is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able
to resell your holding of the Notes at a fair value, if at all.

60


-----

Although application will be made to the Authority for the Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange and for permission
to deal in the Notes, we cannot assure you that the Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance can be made as
to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for
listing or the delisting of the Notes, as applicable, from the Official List of the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s
ability to resell the Notes in the secondary market.

In addition, the Indentures will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could adversely impact the liquidity of the
Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. If investors measure their investment returns by reference to a currency
other than the U.S. dollar, an investment in the Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible
significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on
their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the U.S. dollar
against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the
effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on the Notes is
translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to revision,_**
**_suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the
value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given
period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes
by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financing and could
adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_The New Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures of the relevant_**
**_clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the New Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes, are issued in exchange for bookentry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners
or holders of New Notes. Cede & Co, as nominee for DTC or Euroclear or Clearstream, or their respective nominees, as applicable,
will be the registered holder of the New Notes. The Euro Notes will be deposited with the common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear or Clearstream. After payment to DTC or the common
depositary and Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests in the New Notes. Accordingly, if you own a book-entry interest,
you must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, and if you are not a participant in DTC, Euroclear
or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which you own your interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of
a holder of the Additional Dollar Notes under the Dollar Indenture or the Euro Notes under the Euro Indenture. See “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form.”_

Unlike the holders of the New Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct rights to act upon any
solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the New Notes. Instead, if you own a book-entry
interest, you will be permitted to act only to the extent you have received appropriate proxies to do so from DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any matters on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures, unless and until the definitive registered notes are
issued in respect of all book-entry interests, if you own a book-entry interest, you will be restricted to acting through DTC, Euroclear
or Clearstream, as applicable. We cannot assure you that the procedures to be implemented through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the New Notes. See “Book-Entry,
_Delivery and Form.”_

**_The New Notes are subject to restrictions on transfer._**

The New Notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state securities laws. You may
not offer the New Notes in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration

61


-----

requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or pursuant to an effective registration statement. We
have not undertaken to register the New Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the New Notes in the future.

Furthermore, we have not registered the New Notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that
your offers and sales of the New Notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

**_Investors in the New Notes may have limited recourse against our independent auditors._**

The audit reports of KPMG LLP and Ernst & Young, Chartered Accountants included in this Offering Memorandum contain, in
accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, statements that they have
undertaken their audit work to state to members of the Parent Guarantor and Acuris International Limited, respectively, those
matters they are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose and that they disclaim liability to anyone
other than the members of the Parent Guarantor and Acuris International Limited, respectively, with respect to those reports and
the opinions they have formed.

The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection
with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. (or
any other) court were to give effect to the language quoted above, the recourse that investors in the New Notes may have against
the independent auditors based on their reports or the Historical Financial Statements to which they relate could be limited.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to effect service of process or enforce judgments obtained against us outside of_**
**_the United States._**

The U.S. Issuer and most Subsidiary Guarantors are organized under the laws of the United States. A substantial portion of our
assets are located in the United States and, as a result, it may not be possible for investors to effect service of process or enforce
judgments obtained against us outside the United States.

**_The Indentures are not, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended._**

The Indentures are not required to be, and are not, and will not be, qualified under the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “TIA”) and do not and will not incorporate or include and are not, and will not be, subject to any of the provisions of
the TIA. Consequently, the holders of Existing Dollar Notes are not, and the holders of the New Notes will not be, entitled to the
protections provided under the TIA to holders of debt securities issued under a qualified indenture, including those respecting
preferential collections by the trustee or conflicting interests of the trustee. See “Description of the Dollar Notes” and “Description
_of the Euro Notes.”_

**_The New Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The New Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, in addition to the stated interest on a
New Note, a U.S. Holder (as defined in “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”) will
generally be required to include the OID on such New Note in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues on a constant yieldto-maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in advance of the receipt of the cash payments to which such OID is
attributable and regardless of the U.S. Holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See “Certain
_Tax Considerations—Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”_

**_The Additional Dollar Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Dollar Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Additional Dollar Notes will be issued with different ISINs and CUSIPs from those assigned to the Existing Dollar Notes. The
Additional Dollar Notes offered hereby will not form a single series with the Existing Dollar Notes under the Indenture and will not
be fungible with the Existing Dollar Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These factors may adversely affect the liquidity of
the Additional Dollar Notes and cause them to trade at different prices than the Existing Dollar Notes.

**_The source of interest income on the New Notes is uncertain for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The New Notes are co-issued by the U.S. Issuer and the Luxembourg Issuer and, therefore, each Issuer is liable for repayment of
the New Notes in their entirety. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, if a debt obligation has both a U.S. and non-U.S. coissuer, there is some uncertainty as to the determination of the source of an interest payment on such debt obligation. Although
the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the source of an interest payment on a New Note will be made
by reference to the residence of the Issuer that makes the payment. Accordingly, subject to the following paragraph, we intend to
treat any interest paid by the U.S. Issuer as U.S.-source income and any interest paid by the Luxembourg Issuer as foreign-source
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge this treatment,
and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the treatment of the New Notes or the

62


-----

sourcing of the interest payments on the New Notes. If the interest payments on the New Notes were sourced in a different manner,
the U.S. federal income tax consequences (including with respect to foreign tax credits) to a Holder would be different than those
described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the sourcing of payments on the New Notes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the clearing systems require us to designate only one Issuer for U.S. federal withholding tax
purposes, and we intend to designate the U.S. Issuer as the issuer of the New Notes for this purpose. As such, an applicable
withholding agent likely will treat all interest payments on the New Notes as U.S.-source income for U.S. federal withholding tax
purposes.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We expect to receive gross proceeds of $ million and € million from the Offering. We intend
to use the gross proceeds from the Offering (i) to refinance indebtedness used to finance the Backstop Acquisition, (ii) to fund a
dividend for the repurchase of shares from certain minority shareholders in one or more of our parent companies, (iii) to partially
prepay amounts drawn under the Existing Credit Facility and (iv) to fund general corporate purposes and pay transaction costs
associated with the Offering, including underwriting fees, other financing fees, professional and legal fees, financial advisory fees
and other transaction costs.

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of the proceeds from the Offering. Actual amounts are subject to
adjustment and may differ significantly from estimated amounts at the time of the consummation of the Offering, depending on
several factors, including differences from our estimates of costs and expenses and difference in exchange rates.

**Sources of funds** **($ in millions)** **Uses of funds** **($ in millions)**

Backstop Acquisition repurchase of

General corporate purposes and
estimated fees and expenses[(5)] ........ 25.0

**Total sources .............................** 850.0 **Total uses ...........................................** 850.0

(1) Represents the aggregate U.S. dollar equivalent of the gross proceeds from the issuance of the New Notes.

(2) The allocated proceeds will be used to refinance indebtedness used to finance the Backstop Acquisition.

(3) The allocated proceeds will be used to fund a dividend to repurchase shares of one or more of our parent companies from
certain minority shareholders.

(4) Represents the aggregate principal amount we intend to prepay under our Existing Credit Facility. We may prepay amounts
under either or both euro and dollar tranches of our Existing Credit Facility.

**CAPITALIZATION**

The following table sets forth the cash at bank and in hand and our capitalization as of September 30, 2021 on (i) a historical basis
and (ii) an as adjusted basis to give pro forma effect to the Offering as described in “Use of Proceeds.” Adjusted information below
is illustrative only and does not purport to be indicative of our capitalization following the completion of the Offering. On February
16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris
Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share exchanges. This
reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements reflect the
results of operations of the Group, including the transferred companies, from the first date that the companies came under common
control, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities
of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies and any difference (merger adjustment)
between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the acquired entities’
shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other Reserves.” The amount of debt reflects
the outstanding principal amount of such debt, gross of debt issuance cost, plus the accrued and unpaid interest of such debt as
of September 30, 2021.

You should read this table together with the sections of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Use of Proceeds,” “Selected Historical
_Financial Data,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial_
_Condition and Results of Operations” and with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum.

_______________________

(1) The $22 million adjustment consists of the portion of the proceeds of the Offering that we expect will fund cash at bank and
in hand, net of transaction-related fees and expenses which are estimated to be $3 million. Actual fees and expenses may
differ. As of September 30, 2021, our cash at bank and in hand was $9.0 million. As of January 19, 2022, our cash at
bank and in hand was $69.9 million and, after giving pro forma effect to the Offering, would have been $91.9 million. Our
cash at bank and in hand as of January 19, 2022 was higher than as of September 30, 2021, primarily as a result of cash
inflows from increased invoicing of customers during the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to other periods of the year.

(2) On February 16, 2021, the Issuers and the Parent Guarantor entered into an amended and restated Existing Credit Facility
Agreement, pursuant to which they borrowed (a) $920.0 million in aggregate principal amount under the dollar tranche
(subsequently increased by way of the Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement to $960.0 million) and (b) €790.0 million
in aggregate principal amount under the euro tranche. On May 13, 2021, we prepaid $310.0 million of drawn amounts
under the dollar tranche of our Existing Term Loan Facilities using a portion of the proceeds of the Existing Dollar Notes.
We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of the New Notes to further prepay drawn amounts under either or both tranches
of the Existing Term Loan Facilities. We may prepay amounts under either or both euro and dollar tranches of our Existing
Credit Facility, and the actual prepayment amount under each tranche may differ from what is indicated. See “Use of
_Proceeds.”_

(3) Represents the expected gross proceeds of the Additional Dollar Notes offered hereby.

(4) Represents the expected U.S. dollar equivalent of the gross proceeds of the Euro Notes offered hereby.

(5) Excludes lease liabilities under IFRS 16.

(6) Total shareholders’ equity is not adjusted for the use of proceeds of the Offering, which includes a portion of proceeds that
will be used for the repurchase of shares of one or more of our parent companies from certain minority shareholders.

(7) Represents the sum of total debt and total shareholders’ equity.

**UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION**

**Basis of preparation**

The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information”)
comprises the unaudited pro forma combined statement of comprehensive income of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries for
the year ended December 31, 2020, which gives pro forma effect to the Acuris Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020.
The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been derived from (i) the FY 2020 Financial Statements and (ii)
the Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, and certain pro forma adjustments have been made thereto, inter alia, to eliminate
transactions which were historically made between entities, which are fellow subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor as a result of the
Acuris Acquisition, and would therefore have been subject to intercompany elimination.

On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco
Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share
exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from the first date that the companies
came under common control, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. On consolidation,
the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies and any
difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal
value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other
Reserves.”

Therefore, these results of operations and financial position are not comparable with the results of operations and financial position
of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show
the Parent Guarantor’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial position prior to the acquisition of the Acuris
business.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended
to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial
Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act. Neither
the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with any
generally accepted auditing standards.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have
been achieved had the Acuris Transaction been consummated on the date or for the period indicated and do not purport to indicate
results of operations as of any future date or for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information
addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent our actual financial position or results of operation.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and the accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with
the Historical Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

costs and services charged by Dealogic to Acuris in the amount of $29.731 million. This adjustment also reflects a
reclassification of $3.074 million from Operating expenses to Gain on disposal of property, plant and equipment.

_this Offering Memorandum._

_The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future business. Our actual results_
_could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, but not_
_limited to, those described under “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.”_

**Overview**

Our unique and comprehensive multi-brand offering includes a broad range of capabilities that can address a variety of our
customers’ market intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. Our analytics product portfolio can
be broadly divided into highly complementary Dealogic and Acuris offerings, focused on data and content, respectively.

� _Dealogic: Our Dealogic offering consists of integrated data, workflow software and AI solutions to help financial firms_
improve their competitiveness, productivity and profitability. Dealogic’s global capital markets data serve as a global
benchmark used by all top investment banks and is regularly cited by leading financial publications such as The Wall
Street Journal and The Financial Times. The Dealogic platform, the first platform for SPAC sponsors and sell-side
professionals to source deals and optimize de-SPAC structures, connects our users across a single, global network,
allowing them to break through silos to collaborate, manage resources and target opportunities. Our Dealogic portfolio
also includes Selerity, our proprietary AI technology, which is designed to analyze large amounts of unstructured data
and help automate inefficient workflows for the world’s largest asset managers, banks, exchanges, retail brokers and
media companies.

� _Acuris: Our Acuris offering consists of proprietary content and analysis software and services that source, aggregate and_
deliver valuable financial market data and intelligence, combined with industry-leading expert research and analysis.
Our market insights are relied upon by our diverse customers to originate opportunities and improve their market
awareness in areas ranging from capital markets and leveraged finance to infrastructure and M&A. Our Acuris platform
includes well-established brands such as Mergermarket, Debtwire, Dealreporter and many more. These products provide
real-time information, breaking intelligence and analysis to support investment, advisory and business decisions of our
customers across asset classes, including fixed income, equities, M&A and infrastructure.

We deliver our insights and analysis in a sophisticated, user-friendly format, enhanced with advanced analytics and visualization
tools, enabling our customers to make data-driven decisions. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have delivered
more than 30 years of proprietary datasets as well as more than 2.5 million individual and firm profiles to our customers, making
us the global benchmark for market intelligence. Our customers have used our proprietary software to execute over $7.0 trillion
worth of equity issuance, and our software has analyzed and synthesized insights on more than 1.5 million M&A transactions.

We provide our data, content and software globally to over 6,000 customers, including customers added through the Backstop
Acquisition, with over 150,000 users in those customer organizations, based on management estimates, with varying complexities
and needs, ranging from those that use our workflow automation tools to manage their business to those that use our personalized,
targeted information to navigate complex markets and execute transactions. Our customers are spread globally and include a
wide range of the world’s largest financial institutions, premier investment banks, law firms, private equity, credit and infrastructure
funds and other investors, brokers and financial advisers and corporates.

We have relatively low customer concentration, with our top 10 customers and top 11-30 customers having contributed 26% and
12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma combined basis. This diversity of

74


-----

customers, who are distributed across the U.S., EMEA and APAC, reduces our dependence on any industry, region or customersize specific trends.

The profile of our revenue by segment, industry, geography and customer concentration on a pro forma combined basis for the
year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]:

*Most recent available data is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The profile of our number of customers across different industries of Dealogic, Acuris and the combined group as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]:

*Most recent available data is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from long-term subscription-based licenses, which provide us with a highly visible
revenue stream. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Recurring Revenue accounted for 91% (after giving pro forma
effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our overall revenue on a pro forma combined basis. As of September 30, 2021, the Weighted
Average Contract Term of our contracts was 2.26 years and we had a customer retention rate of 95%.

Our business has grown organically and through acquisitions. In July 2019, our affiliate group, the ION Group, acquired Acuris,
and in February 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, Acuris became part of our Group. Acuris is a
leading provider of proprietary, actionable intelligence and analytics to the world’s leading advisors, investors and issuers, with its
embedded products in subscriber workflows. By bringing together Dealogic’s industry-leading data and software with Acuris’ wellknown content and editorial brands and capabilities, the acquisition enabled us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of innovative,
differentiated intelligence and solutions to our customers. While we have retained the original brands of the acquired companies
in order to fulfill our multi-brand strategy and be able to serve a broad set of potential customers, each acquired business has been
fully integrated from a sales, operational and technology perspective. In October 2019, we acquired Selerity, a financial technology
company using proprietary AI to deliver content and data solutions designed to automate inefficient workflows in finance for clients
ranging from sophisticated asset management firms and banks on Wall Street to innovative media and technology companies
serving retail investors. Selerity’s cutting edge technology combined with the ION Group’s well-established product capabilities
enable us to deliver Dealogic and Acuris world-class content to our customers across the integrated ION Analytics platform.

In November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Backstop. The Backstop Acquisition was completed on December
28, 2021. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative and institutional investment industries. It specializes in
integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment and operations firms to build and source manager
relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital and service and communicate with investors.

**Significant Factors Affecting our Results of Operations**

75


-----

Our results of operations during the periods under review have been primarily affected by the following factors, which we expect
will continue to affect our business and results of operations in the future.

**_Industry trends_**

Our results of operations are affected by trends that affect our industry generally. Businesses are increasingly seeking to take
advantage of technology that enables them to obtain certain market information, digitize and automate certain business processes.
Information provides decision-makers with powerful insights. Digitization creates a number of benefits, such as increased
efficiency, transparency, control, auditability, reliability and security. The automation of manual processes frees up customer
resources, reduces errors and enables companies to have information in real time. Information, digitization and automation of
business processes empower users to achieve more. Customers use our software for mission critical tasks, such as deal execution,
roadshows and events in the context of capital markets transactions, as well as to manage complex risk management and
compliance solutions. In addition, customers use our research tools to obtain insights across multiple asset classes.

These broader industry trends affect the demand for our content, software and services from new and existing customers, thereby
affecting our business and results of operations.

**_Total Contract Value, Recurring Revenue and customer retention rates_**

In addition to our IFRS metrics, we focus on our Total Contract Value, defined as the Annual Contract Value multiplied by the
Weighted Average Contract Term, as it informs the quality of, and our expectation for, Recurring Revenue, which we define as the
revenues from licenses over time and post-contractual support revenue. As Recurring Revenue allows us to expect future
revenues, it is our business strategy to sell long-term subscription licenses that generate Recurring Revenue and transition any
short-term subscription licenses to long-term subscription licenses that generate Recurring Revenue. This increases Total Contract
Value and in turn increases the certainty of our future Recurring Revenue. As of September 30, 2021, our Total Contract Value
was $954.0 million. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, we generated 89.8% of our total revenue on a pro forma
combined basis from sources that we consider to be recurring.

Along with Total Contract Value and Recurring Revenue, we believe that customer loyalty significantly contributes to the recurring
nature of our revenues, adding to predictability of our revenue. As of September 30, 2021, our customer retention rate would have
been 95%. We believe that the characteristics of our software, along with our focus on long-term contracts and our customers’
needs, have resulted in these high customer retention rates and we strive to maintain and improve such rates through the efforts
described under “Summary—Our Growth Strategy.”

**_Personnel and information technology costs_**

Given our low fixed-cost structure, staff costs comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses (before foreign
exchange (gains)/losses), representing 70% of our operating expenses for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 on a pro
forma combined basis. As of September 30, 2021, we had over 1,512 employees. Related costs, such as travel and entertainment
costs, tend to correlate with our staff costs.

**Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations**

**_Acuris Acquisition_**

On July 11, 2019, Acuris International Limited, through its subsidiary, Acuris Bidco Limited, acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited,
the holding company of the Acuris group of companies. On February 16, 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION
Group, the Parent Guarantor acquired Acuris Bidco Limited and its subsidiaries (constituting the Acuris business). The Parent
Guarantor’s consolidated results of operations for the financial years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 do not include
any results of the Acuris business. For an illustration of what our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020
would have been had the Acuris Acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2020, please refer to “Unaudited Pro Forma
_Combined Financial Information.” The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_ reflect the results of the Group, including Acuris
Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc., from the first date that the companies came under common
control, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. As a result of this accounting treatment,
the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and
the comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020) are not comparable with the results of operations
and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only
show the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial position prior to the reorganization. See “Presentation of Financial
_and Other Information—Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations—Effect of Common Control Accounting” and_
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Information.”

Additionally, the consolidated financial statements of Acuris International Limited as of and for the period ended December 31,
2019 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum show the consolidated financial results of operations of Acuris International
Limited from April 18, 2019, its date of incorporation, to December 31, 2019. Therefore, these financial statements do not reflect a
full year of operation of the Acuris business in 2019 and are not comparable with the annual financial statements of Acuris
International Limited as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In this
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we will provide a discussion of key line
items from Acuris International Limited’s unaudited income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 (prepared based on
unaudited management information for illustrative purposes only, as compared to Acuris International Limited’s audited income
statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 that forms part of the Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this
Offering Memorandum.

**_Impact of IFRS 16_**

In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 (Leases), which requires most leases to be recognized as right-of-use assets and lease
liabilities on balance sheets for lessees, thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. IFRS 16 replaces
IAS 17 (Leases) and related interpretations. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the
use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For such contracts, IFRS 16 requires a lessee to
recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated and the liability accrues interest. This
results in a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when the lessee pays constant annual rentals. The Parent
Guarantor implemented IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019 and applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach.
On transition to IFRS 16, the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries recognized $12.6 million of right-of-use assets and $16.9 million
lease liabilities. See note 1(s) to the FY 2019 Financial Statements. The FY 2018 Financial Statements have not been restated to
take into account IFRS 16 Acuris International Limited implemented IFRS 16 from its incorporation and the accounting policies
applied in the preparation of the Acuris 2019 Financial Statements and Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements reflect the
requirements of IFRS 16.

**Key Line Items in Our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income**

The following is a brief description of certain line items included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income:

**_Revenue_**

Revenue represents the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We derive our revenue from licenses and subscriptions
of our software and related professional services, which can include assistance in implementation, customization and integration,
post-contract customer support and other professional services.

We classify our revenue principally into the following four categories: (i) revenue from license at a point in time, which relates to
perpetual licenses, (ii) revenue from licenses over time, which relates to subscription licenses, (iii) revenue from professional
services, which relates to projects to implement, configure and upgrade software, train and consult customers, or migrate
customers from one product to another or onto cloud, and (iv) revenue from post-contractual support, which relates to software
support and maintenance.

We typically invoice customers annually in advance for all contract revenue streams except for professional service revenue, which
can be either billed in advance, on satisfaction of milestones or monthly in arrear. As such, substantially all deferred revenue at
the end of an accounting year will be recognized in the following year, with the exception of (i) contracts where revenue recognition
is deferred due to uncertainty over payment and (ii) contracts with a significant financing component.

**_Operating expenses_**

Operating expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including research and development, client services, administration
and sales, information technology, operating lease rentals, professional fees including integration costs and other administrative
costs.

**_Amortization of intangible assets_**

Represents the amortization of intangible assets, including the amortization of capitalized development costs.

**_Operating profit_**

Operating profit represents revenue less operating expenses and amortization of intangible assets.

77


-----

**_Finance income_**

Finance income consists primarily of interest on bank deposits and other interest.

**_Finance expenses_**

Finance expenses primarily comprise interest accrued on bank loans repayable and our Existing Dollar Notes, amortization and
write-off on extinguishment of debt issuance costs, interest on redeemable shares and shares presented as liabilities, loss on
extinguishment of shares presented as liabilities, gain on repurchase of debt, interest on lease liabilities and other interest.

**_Tax on (loss)/profit on ordinary activities_**

Tax on (loss)/profit on ordinary activities is comprised of the current year’s underlying current and deferred tax charge. The statutory
rate of corporation tax for each period is applied to profits and losses in each jurisdiction. The effective rate of tax may vary from
these rates due to timing difference between when, or if, certain items of income or expense are recognized for financial reporting
and tax purposes.

**_Loss for the financial year_**

(Loss)/profit for the financial year represents our operating profit plus our finance income, less our finance expenses and less the
tax on loss before taxation.

**Results of Operations of the Parent Guarantor**

On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco
Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share
exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial
Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from January 1, 2020 as both
companies were under common control at that date, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies
and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the
nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other
Reserves.” As a result of this accounting treatment, the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition as of and
for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and the comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020)
are not comparable with the results of operations and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial position prior to
the reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its
subsidiaries as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 (as restated) and as at and for the year
ended December 31, 2020 have been extracted from the statutory financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019
and 2020, respectively, authorized prior to the reorganization.

The following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations of the Parent Guarantor for the years ended December 31,
2018, 2019 and 2020, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2021.

**_Comparison of Results of Operations of the Parent Guarantor for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and_**
**_September 30, 2020_**

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by $26.4 million, or 7.8%, to $363.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $337.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This was primarily attributable to a $19.9 million increase in subscription revenue
mainly driven by organic growth in subscription contracts. Non-subscription revenue also increased by $6.4 million due to the quick
recovery of market activity, which was affected by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020.

_Operating expenses_

Operating expenses decreased by $121.5 million, or 47.8%, to $132.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from
$254.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to $111.7 million foreign
exchange gain in 2021 relating to the non-cash effect of our euro-denominated loans which are revalued at the end of each quarter
or financial year.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable slightly increasing to $123.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 from $119.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

_Operating profit_

Operating profit increased by $143.9 million, or 393.2%%, to a profit of $107.3 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2021 from a loss of $36.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, due to the reasons set forth above.

_Finance income_

Finance income increased by $2.0 million to $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $35,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020, due to $2.0 million increase in intercompany interest income in 2021.

_Finance expenses_

Finance expenses increased by $60.8 million, or 58.9%, to $164.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from
$103.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to the expenses incurred
on repurchase of our debt facilities in 2021.

_Tax on loss_

We reported a tax on loss on ordinary activities of $39.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to a tax
credit of $31.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This change is primarily attributable to the decrease in our
loss on ordinary activities before tax and to the deferred tax impact of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities in the United
Kingdom to reflect tax rate changes enacted during the year.

_Loss for the period_

Loss for the period decreased by $7.5 million or 7.1% to $98.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from
$105.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to the reasons set forth above.

_Revenue_

79


-----

Revenue increased by $26.8 million, or 14.5%, to $211.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $184.6 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to a $22.0 million increase in professional services revenue, as
well as growth in subscription revenue of $6.1 million, both from the acquisition of Selerity Inc. in September 2019 and growth in
organic subscription contracts. Transaction revenue decreased by $1.3 million, primarily due to the short-term decrease in market
activity due to COVID-19, with quick recovery in the second quarter of 2020 onward.

_Operating expenses_

Operating expenses increased by $35.8 million, or 39.9%, to $125.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $89.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to a foreign exchange loss of $30.9 million
in 2020 relating to the non-cash effect of our euro-denominated loans which are revalued at the end of each quarter or financial
year. Excluding non-cash foreign exchange losses, operating expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.6%.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable slightly decreasing to $64.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 from $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

_Operating profit_

Operating profit decreased by $7.7 million, or 26.8%, to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $28.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the reasons set forth above.

_Finance income_

Finance income increased by $0.02 million, or 200.0%, to $0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $0.01 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to higher interest income in 2020.

_Finance expenses_

Finance expenses decreased by $10.3 million, or 29.2%, to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $35.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the interest on our debt facilities.

_Tax on loss_

We reported a tax on loss on ordinary activities of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a tax credit of
$2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change is primarily attributable to the decrease in our loss on ordinary
activities before tax and to an additional tax burden in the United States, in particular BEAT taxes.

_Loss for the financial year_

Loss for the financial year increased by $0.8 million or 21.1% to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the reasons set forth above.

**_Comparison of Results of Operations of the Parent Guarantor for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31,_**
**_2018_**

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by $14.8 million, or 8.7%, to $184.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $169.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily attributable to a $11.4 million increase in professional services revenue, as
well as growth in subscription revenue of $4.4 million, both from the acquisition of Selerity Inc. in September 2019 and growth in
organic subscription contracts.

_Operating expenses_

Operating expenses decreased by $13.9 million, or 13.4%, to $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $103.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in headcount from an average
of 698 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to an average of 454 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as
decreases in other expenses such as professional fees, office and related expenses and travel and entertainment expenses.

-----

Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable slightly decreasing to $66.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Operating profit_

For the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded an operating profit of $28.7 million up from a loss of $1.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018, due to the reasons set forth above.

_Finance income_

Finance income decreased by $11.0 million, or 100%, to $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $11.0 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to a foreign exchange gain of $0.01 million in 2019 relating to the non-cash effect of
our euro-denominated loans which are revalued at the end of each quarter or financial year, compared to a similar gain of $11.0
million in 2018.

_Finance expenses_

Finance expenses decreased by $9.6 million, or 21.4%, to $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $44.9 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest expense for the year
ended December 31, 2019, as well as higher costs relating to the amortization of debt issuance costs relating to a refinancing of
our debt in the year ended December 31, 2018.

_Tax on loss on ordinary activities_

We reported a tax credit of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a tax credit of $8.6 million for the year
ended December 31, 2018. This change is primarily attributable to the decrease in our loss on ordinary activities before tax and to
a change in the blended tax rate applicable to deferred tax liabilities on acquisition intangibles.

_Loss for the financial year_

Loss for the financial year increased by $39.9 million or 91.1% to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $43.8
million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the reasons set forth above.

**Results of Operations of Acuris International Limited**

**_Comparison of certain key line items of the Results of Operations of Acuris International Limited for the year ended_**
**_December 31, 2020 and for the unaudited management information for the year ended December 31, 2019_**

Acuris International Limited was incorporated on April 18, 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited, the holding company
of the Acuris group on July 11, 2019. Therefore, the consolidated audited financial statements of Acuris International Limited for
the period ended December 31, 2019 cover the period from April 18, 2019 to December 31, 2019.

For purposes of facilitating the comparison of the results of operations of Acuris between 2019 and 2020, we present below a
discussion of certain key line items of the results of operations of Acuris International Limited for the year ended December 31,
2020 based on the audited Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, as compared to unaudited management information for the year
ended December 31, 2019, which was prepared for illustrative purposes only. See “Presentation of Financial and Other
_Information.” Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors have audited, reviewed, compiled or performed_
any procedures with respect to such management information and, accordingly, neither our independent auditors nor any other
independent auditors have expressed an opinion or provided any form of assurance with respect thereto for the purpose of this
Offering Memorandum. See “Risk Factors—The Acuris 2019 Unaudited Financial Information included herein has not been audited
_or otherwise reviewed by outside auditors, consultants or experts, is subject to management estimates and should not be relied_
_upon in isolation when making an investment decision.”_

_Revenue_

Revenue increased by $6.7 million, or 2.5%, to $277.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $270.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2019. This was primarily attributable to a growth in Recurring Revenue offsetting a small reduction in
Non-Recurring Revenue caused by COVID-19.

_Operating expenses_

Operating expenses increased by $41.6 million, or 18.5%, to $266.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $224.9
million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to foreign exchange loss of $79.1 million in

81


-----

2020 relating to the non-cash effect of our euro-denominated loans which are revalued at the end of each quarter or financial year,
partially offset by decreases in other expenses, in particular one-off professional fees connected to the sale of the business in the
year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding non-cash foreign exchange losses, operating expenses decreased by $38.7 million, or
17.1%.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $23.8 million, or 33.2%, to $95.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from
$71.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to increased fair value acquisition
intangible assets recognized on the acquisition of Acuris by the ION Group in July 2019, leading to a higher amortization expense
going forward.

_Finance expenses_

Finance expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 2.4%, to $113.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $111.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense for the year
ended December 31, 2020.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business
operations, including working capital needs, capital expenditure, debt service obligations, other commitments and contractual
obligations.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities, bank credit lines and other forms of indebtedness, including
the Revolving Credit Facility provided under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility permits us to
draw up to a principal amount of $20.0 million, and as of the date hereof, the Revolving Credit Facility is not drawn. Although we
believe that our expected operating cash flows, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and
debt service needs, we cannot be certain that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt
and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New
Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The ability of our businesses to generate cash from their operations depends on future
operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under “Risk Factors” and “—Factors
_Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations.”_

We typically invoice our customers annually in advance for all contract revenue streams except for professional service revenue,
which can be either be billed in advance or on satisfaction of milestones. As a result, we usually maintain a structurally negative
working capital and depend on such advance payments by our customers, which are accounted for as deferred revenue, to meet
our short-term expenses.

Typically, our working capital is at the highest late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter as we typically invoice at the
end of the year and typically it is lowest in the third quarter. This general seasonality is affected by our invoicing for professional
services, which do not necessarily occur at the end of the year.

**_Cash Flows_**

The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated:

_Net Cash Flows Generated by Operating Activities_

Net cash flows generated by operating activities increased by $24.7 million, or 16.9%, to $171.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 from $146.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to growth
in operating profit driven by growing revenue and significant decrease in operating costs of $7.5 million (before foreign exchange
(gains)/losses).

Net cash generated by operating activities decreased by $13.6 million, or 18.1%, to $61.6 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 from $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to working capital movements
primarily due to a decrease in trade and other payables of $17.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an
increase of $5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, and an increase in trade and other receivables of $25.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to an increase of $20.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, offset by
operating profit growth driven by growing revenue and stable operating costs (before foreign exchange (gains)/losses.

Net cash generated by operating activities decreased by $3.0 million, or 3.8%, to $75.2 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to working capital movements,
primarily an increase in trade and other receivables of $20.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to a decrease
of $1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by operating profit growth driven by growing revenue and decreasing
operating costs (before foreign exchange (gains)/losses).

_Net Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities_

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $56.8 million, or 212.6%, to $83.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 from $26.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to lending
$55.8 million to fellow subsidiary undertakings for general corporate purposes in September 2021 and cash consideration of $2.0
million paid as part of an earnout in connection with the Blackpeak acquisition.

Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased by $17.8 million, or 69.0%, to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31,
2020 from $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to the cash consideration
paid in connection with our acquisition of Selerity Inc. in 2019.

Net cash flows used in investing activities increased by $6.6 million, or 34.4%, to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31,
2019 from $19.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to the cash consideration
paid in connection with our acquisition of Selerity Inc. in 2019.

_Net Cash Flows Generated by/Used in Financing Activities_

Net cash flows used in financing activities remained relatively stable, slightly decreasing to $96.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2021 from $97.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Net cash flows from financing activities remained relatively stable slightly decreasing to $55.5 million for the year ended December
31, 2020 from $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

83


-----

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an outflow of
$75.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily attributable to lower repayment of borrowings in
the year ended December 31, 2019 ($24.8 million) compared to the same period of 2018 ($38.1 million).

**Capital Expenditures**

The table below presents a breakdown of our consolidated capital expenditures for the periods indicated.

**Nine months ended**

**Year ended December 31** **September 30**

**2018** **2019** **2020** **2020** **2021**

**($ in thousands)**
Payments for tangible

Payments for intangible
assets ........................... (17,004) (8,508) (8,352) (6,513) (8,624)
**Total capital**
**expenditures ...................** **(19,246)** **(8,538)** **(8,369)** **(7,225)** **(9,050)**

Our most significant capital expenditures related to software development, purchase of property, plant and equipment, payments
of intangible assets and office and other lease costs under IFRS 16.

Capital expenditures increased by $1.8 million, or 25.3%, to $9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $7.2
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to an increased capitalization of sales
commission of $2.1 million.

Capital expenditures remained relatively stable slightly decreasing to $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $8.5
million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Capital expenditures decreased by $10.8 million, or 56%, to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $19.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in payments of intangible assets as a result
of a reduction in Development staff headcount between 2018 and 2019, and a one-off payment for a perpetual software license
made in the year ended December 31, 2018.

Our capital expenditure was $13.5 million in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis.

We expect near-term capital expenditures to remain in line with the above levels, and we expect to fund such capital expenditures
through our net cash flows from operating activities.

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2021.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risks**

Below is the summary of our quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks. In the ordinary course of business, we are
exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. For more information see Note 15 of the FY 2020 Financial
Statements. We have a risk management program in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on our financial
performance. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management
framework.

This discussion does not address other risks to which we are exposed in the ordinary course of business, such as operational
risks. See “Risk Factors.”

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and outstanding
transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. Our exposure to credit risk is
influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each of our customers. We currently do not have a significant concentration
of credit risk. We have a large exposure to the financial services industry and our credit risk profile could be adversely affected by
significant changes in that industry. We have adopted internal procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to
our trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. Financial instruments, cash and
short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual

84


-----

banks or institutions at any one time. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents our maximum
credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the financial assets.

**_Liquidity Risk_**

Liquidity risk is the risk concerning the ability to meet obligations arising out from financial liabilities as they fall due. Our approach
to managing liquidity risk is to ensure as far as possible that we will always have sufficient liquidity to meet our liabilities when due,
under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to our reputation. Our policy
is to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements.

**_Currency Risk_**

As we conduct business internationally, we are exposed to the foreign exchange risk deriving from the different currencies in which
we operate. Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to the risk of
changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to our operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency
and our net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall, we seek to hedge our foreign exchange exposure by matching the income
and liabilities in each currency and additionally financing any acquisitions of significant transactions in the currency of the acquired
entity or acquired asset. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Currency and interest rate fluctuations and
_volatility in global currency markets may have a significant impact on our reported revenues and earnings.”_

**_Interest Rate Risk_**

Interest rate risk is the risk concerning the fluctuations of interest rates applicable to our external borrowings and the fair value or
future cash flows of a financial instrument.

Our interest rate risk originates primarily from variable interest rates in the form of the term loan facilities and the Revolving Credit
Facility under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement.

For all material categories of financial assets and financial liabilities, the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair
values. Our management assessed (i) that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank
overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these
instruments and (ii) that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate their carrying amounts
largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the
external borrowings. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Currency and interest rate fluctuations and volatility
_in global currency markets may have a significant impact on our reported revenues and earnings.”_

**Critical Accounting Policies**

The Historical Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS. The amounts presented in the Historical Financial
Statements involve the use of estimates and assumptions about the future. Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated
and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining
such estimates and judgments could cause actual results to differ and the estimates and assumptions will seldom equal the related
actual results.

Our accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 of FY 2020 Financial Statements and elsewhere in this Offering
Memorandum. We believe the following policies to be the most significant policies that require management to consider matters
that are inherently uncertain or to make subjective and complex judgments.

**_Development costs_**

We capitalize development costs for development projects in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalization of costs
is based on management’s judgment that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be
capitalized, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the expected
period of benefits.

**_Tax provisions_**

The determination of our provision for income tax requires certain judgments and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate
tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgment
as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included
in the Historical Financial Statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be
different than that which is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals.

85


-----

**_Provisions and accruals_**

In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the
obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

**_Provision for doubtful debts_**

For trade receivables, we use a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days
past due, initially based on our historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a
significant judgment exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic
conditions. Our historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future
actual default rates.

**_Business combinations_**

As part of a business combination, the assets and liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto our consolidated statement of
financial position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgments used in determining the fair value of the
identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some
of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS
and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgment is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, including
assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount
rate. In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalized, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing.

**_Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities_**

In determining the initial measurement of the lease liability, we discount lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing
rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee
would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic
environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, we make judgment on the selection of appropriate
benchmark rates and necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease, as set out above.

_publication date (and not as of the date of this Offering Memorandum) and the opinions expressed in the Burton-Taylor Content_
_are subject to change without notice._

**Overview**

We are an industry-leading global data, content and technology company combining two prominent names in capital markets data,
content and intelligence: Dealogic and Acuris. Widely recognized across the capital markets, we develop and provide missioncritical proprietary analytics and insights to thousands of participants in the global financial markets, including investors, issuers,

making, enable collaboration within their organization and manage resources to increase productivity and competitiveness and
better achieve business objectives. Our customers also rely on our market-leading intelligence, analysis, editorial content and
powerful data analytics to improve their market awareness, enhance their business performance and originate opportunities.

**Industry Size**

Financial institutions are increasing their investment in financial technology, with an increased focus on innovation and efficiency.
Driven by new technologies and delivery models, institutions are shifting away from costly developed in-house solutions towards
external expenditures for third-party solutions. Increasing regulation is also fueling the need for institutions to leverage technology
to manage their risks and operations in real time.

According to Burton-Taylor, the global spend on financial market data/analysis in 2020 amounted to $33.2 billion, equating to a
growth rate of 5.9% from 2020. Burton Taylor also notes the growth rate in 2021 is anticipated to be higher than the 5-year CAGR
of 4.0%.

**Industry Growth Drivers**

The Financial Information Services market is fast paced and dynamic, and has evolved significantly in the recent years. There are
a number of key trends which are expected to continue to shape the industry:

� Increasing need for data and analytics

� NLP and AI-driven personalized content and insights

� Demand for actionable, real-time intelligence

� Growing complexity of financial markets and evolving modes of product consumption

� Heightened regulation and compliance requirements

**_Increasing Need for Data and Analytics_**

We expect growing data consumption to lead to higher demand for real-time and non-real-time data, as well as tighter integration
with analytics and integration. Our customers are continually looking for data driven insights into clients and ways to make their
businesses more efficient through increased speed and effectiveness of decision making, while simultaneously simplifying their
processes and costs. Certain internal functions can be burdensome and costly for our clients and can be done more efficiently by
an outsourced third-party provider. ION Analytics provides the data and information to make decisions regarding resource
allocation and timely reaction to latest proprietary intelligence at scale.

**_NLP and AI-driven Personalized Content and Insights_**

Advances in technology including Neuro-linguistic programming (“NLP”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) have enhanced data
processing and capabilities across the Financial Information Services Industry. As a result, there is an increased demand for
personalized content and insights to support data-driven decisions to keep up in a fast-paced nature of today’s markets. We expect
the need for greater and more accurate data to drive increased demand for our integrated data and analytics products.

87


-----

**_Demand for Actionable, Real-time Intelligence_**

Financial institutions have experienced intense competition across a smaller number of large players, following a period of
consolidation seen after the financial recession. As a result, institutions require real-time data and to support trading, analytics, risk
metrics, reporting and other work streams that are fully integrated into their internal systems, in order to remain competitive.

A sizeable opportunity also exists for content digitization across various areas that have historically been under-covered, such as
in private capital markets. Our products are uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend by providing solutions for real-time
decisions in distribution and origination, as well as real-time proprietary information from an extensive global journalist network.

**_Growing Complexity of Financial Markets and Evolving Modes of Product Consumption_**

The market landscape is changing as capital markets have grown and become more global in nature, resulting in investment
preferences that continue to shift. Data and analytics continue to develop beyond traditional equities into other asset classes such
as fixed income and private capital, as customers look for more diversification and flexibility in their multi-asset class investment
solutions. In particular, the shift from single asset human trading to single asset and multi asset class electronic trading facilitates
the need for more sophisticated distribution capabilities and data.

The increased accessibility of private capital is creating alternative market structures and more sophisticated investment vehicles,
which are becoming increasingly popular with investors. Alternative Asset Managers are increasingly focused on front-office
Limited Partner fundraising efforts, and IR workflow management processes.

Furthermore, banks are increasingly in need of real-time data, as the modes of consuming information have evolved and expanded.
Cloud-based mobility solutions allow anytime access for key information for clients, which is particularly relevant to investment
bankers and other financial professionals that spend significant time on the road and require information on-the-go.

**_Heightened Regulation and Compliance Requirements_**

Our target customers and, in particular, companies operating in the financial services sector, are undergoing a period of significant
regulatory change, with new policies and increased scrutiny from regulators across the world since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
New regulatory requirements such as, in the European Union, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, developed by the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as part of Basel III, the revised Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II), higher capital
requirements and changing standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (Financial Instruments), require
increasing transparency across systems and divisions, better integrated risk analysis and systems, real-time and more granular
levels of reporting and the ability to handle large volumes of data across multiple systems.

At the same time, the more onerous requirements of recent regulatory changes have driven a significant rise in spending by
companies in order to implement new regulatory initiatives. Even the private markets are seeing increasing pressure to efficiently
monitor and track activity that drives investment decisions, as Limited Partners are demanding more timely reporting and greater
transparency.

This rise, together with broader industry pressures, have led to an increased focus on minimizing control and data inconsistencies,
increasing transparency and minimizing costs, where companies are increasingly looking to third-party vendors to provide more
efficient and cost-effective information technology solutions. We believe that the regulatory and reporting environment will continue
to evolve, and that this trend, together with associated cost pressures, will support further industry growth in our markets in the
coming years, as well as drive incremental demand for, and adoption of, our software and products.

**Financial Technology Industry Player Characteristics**

Successful financial technology companies are characterized by a consistent set of business attributes, such as their specialized
vertical focus, barriers to entry, proprietary data and analytics, network effects, and attractive financial characteristics.

**_Vertical Focus_**

Financial services companies are large, complex organizations that have numerous processes that require the assistance of third
parties. As a result, large banks have unique technology and data needs that are best met by data and technology providers with
a deep understanding of and vertically specific focus on the financial services end market.

88


-----

**_Barriers to Entry_**

The financial information services market benefits from relatively higher barriers to entry with a number of success factors including
brand value and loyalty, deep domain expertise, embedded customer relationships and extensive knowledge of varying customer
needs. Given the mission critical nature of the data, customers typically choose vendors that have a long-standing reputation and
history of delivering accurate and timely data and analytics, as well as integrated and intuitive interphases that make the data easily
accessible. Products are typically embedded within the client’s daily workflows, and would require significant time and investment
for switching providers.

**_Proprietary Content and Insight_**

Because of their mission-critical and embedded nature, successful financial technology providers often have access to a deep,
rich set of industry data from which they are able to derive proprietary data sets and analytical tools that further enhance their value
to the banks.

**_Network Effects_**

Brand recognition is a key competitive factor for financial software analytics companies, as investment banks, clients, and financial
publications overwhelmingly favor familiar providers, creating a network effect once a brand is established as an industry leader.

**_Attractive Financial Characteristics_**

Because of the subscription-nature of many software products, financial technology providers often see high recurring revenues
and significant revenue visibility. Successful providers with embedded solutions see high client retention rates, further enhancing
the stability of their revenue streams. Further, technology and analytics companies often have very high EBITDA margins and
significant operating leverage given the low incremental cost of supporting new subscriptions and the ability to leverage their
existing cost base. As a result, the addition of every incremental customer or instance of product cross-selling is very high margin
for software providers. Additionally, these firms do not typically require significant capital expenditures leading to very high free
cash flow conversion. Further, most software analytics providers bill quarterly or annually upfront, providing for minimal cash
requirements for working capital.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

Both Dealogic and Acuris are market leaders and provide mission critical data that represents a small fraction of our customers
typical operating costs. They have a long track record and an extensive database of proprietary data that is difficult and time
consuming to replicate by new entrants. Both Dealogic and Acuris are highly complementary platforms, through Dealogic’s
structured deal data and Acuris’ unstructured journalistic content and widely known brands. The combination of both segments
within ION Analytics offers the opportunity to cross and up-sell to clients, further deepening the relationships.

Dealogic competes within the financial technology industry as a provider of best-in-class data and software technology for global
and regional investment banks.

Acuris offers a portfolio of specialized products with no single, direct competitor that offers similar comprehensive breadth and
depth coverage in the financial information market. Competition is on a per product basis, however we believe to have a superior
offering to each of these products driven by the quality of our proprietary editorial content and breadth of coverage in terms of asset
classes and geographies. In addition, we benefit from the additional analytics capabilities that Acuris offers to each of its individual
products.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are an industry-leading global data, content and technology company combining two prominent names in capital markets data,
content and intelligence: Dealogic and Acuris. Widely recognized across the capital markets, we develop and provide missioncritical proprietary analytics and insights, through integrated data and workflow software, to thousands of participants in the global
financial markets, including investors, issuers, investment banks and legal and other advisors. Our customers use our sophisticated
technological tools to enhance decision making, enable collaboration within their organization and manage resources to increase
productivity and competitiveness and better achieve business objectives. Our customers also rely on our market-leading
intelligence, analysis, editorial content and powerful data analytics to improve their market awareness, enhance their business
performance and originate opportunities.

Our unique and comprehensive multi-brand offering includes a broad range of capabilities that can address a variety of our
customers’ market intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. Our analytics product portfolio can
be broadly divided into highly complementary Dealogic and Acuris offerings, focused on data and content, respectively.

� _Dealogic: Our Dealogic offering consists of integrated data, workflow software and AI solutions to help financial firms_
improve their competitiveness, productivity and profitability. Dealogic’s global capital markets data serve as a global
benchmark used by all top investment banks and is regularly cited by leading financial publications such as The Wall
Street Journal and The Financial Times. The Dealogic platform, the first platform for SPAC sponsors and sell-side
professionals to source deals and optimize de-SPAC structures, connects our users across a single, global network,
allowing them to break through silos to collaborate, manage resources and target opportunities. Our Dealogic portfolio
also includes Selerity, our proprietary AI technology, which is designed to analyze large amounts of unstructured data
and help automate inefficient workflows for the world’s largest asset managers, banks, exchanges, retail brokers and
media companies.

� _Acuris: Our Acuris offering consists of proprietary content and analysis software and services that source, aggregate and_
deliver valuable financial market data and intelligence, combined with industry-leading expert research and analysis.
Our market insights are relied upon by our diverse customers to originate opportunities and improve their market
awareness in areas ranging from capital markets and leveraged finance to infrastructure and M&A. Our Acuris platform
includes well-established brands such as Mergermarket, Debtwire, Dealreporter and many more. These products provide
real-time information, breaking intelligence and analysis to support investment, advisory and business decisions of our
customers across asset classes, including fixed income, equities, M&A and infrastructure.

We deliver our insights and analysis in a sophisticated, user-friendly format, enhanced with advanced analytics and visualization
tools, enabling our customers to make data-driven decisions. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, we have delivered
more than 30 years of proprietary datasets as well as more than 2.5 million individual and firm profiles to our customers, making
us the global benchmark for market intelligence. Our customers have used our proprietary software to execute over $7.0 trillion
worth of equity issuance, and our software has analyzed and synthesized insights on more than 1.5 million M&A transactions.

We provide our data, content and software globally to over 6,000 customers, including customers added through the Backstop
Acquisition, with over 150,000 users in those customer organizations, based on management estimates, with varying complexities
and needs, ranging from those that use our workflow automation tools to manage their business to those that use our personalized,
targeted information to navigate complex markets and execute transactions. Our customers are spread globally and include a
wide range of the world’s largest financial institutions, premier investment banks, law firms, private equity, credit and infrastructure
funds and other investors, brokers and financial advisers and corporates.

We have relatively low customer concentration, with our top 10 customers and top 11-30 customers having contributed 26% and
12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma combined basis. This diversity of
customers, who are distributed across the U.S., EMEA and APAC, reduces our dependence on any industry, region or customersize specific trends.

The profile of our revenue by segment, industry, geography and customer concentration on a pro forma combined basis for the
year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]:

*Most recent available data is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The profile of our number of customers across different industries of Dealogic, Acuris and the combined group as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]:

*Most recent available data is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.

We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from long-term subscription-based licenses, which provide us with a highly visible
revenue stream. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Recurring Revenue accounted for 91% (after giving pro forma
effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our overall revenue on a pro forma combined basis. As of September 30, 2021, the Weighted
Average Contract Term of our contracts was 2.26 years and we had a customer retention rate of 95%.

Our business has grown organically and through acquisitions. In July 2019, our affiliate group, the ION Group, acquired Acuris,
and in February 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, Acuris became part of our Group. Acuris is a
leading provider of proprietary, actionable intelligence and analytics to the world’s leading advisors, investors and issuers, with its
embedded products in subscriber workflows. By bringing together Dealogic’s industry-leading data and software with Acuris’ wellknown content and editorial brands and capabilities, the acquisition enabled us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of innovative,
differentiated intelligence and solutions to our customers. While we have retained the original brands of the acquired companies
in order to fulfill our multi-brand strategy and be able to serve a broad set of potential customers, each acquired business has been
fully integrated from a sales, operational and technology perspective. In October 2019, we acquired Selerity, a financial technology
company using proprietary AI to deliver content and data solutions designed to automate inefficient workflows in finance for clients
ranging from sophisticated asset management firms and banks on Wall Street to innovative media and technology companies
serving retail investors. Selerity’s cutting edge technology combined with the ION Group’s well-established product capabilities
enable us to deliver Dealogic and Acuris world-class content to our customers across the integrated ION Analytics platform.

In November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Backstop. The Backstop Acquisition was completed on December
28, 2021. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative and institutional investment industries. It specializes in
integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment and operations firms to build and source manager
relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital and service and communicate with investors.

**Our Strengths**

We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the following strengths:

91


-----

**_Highly complementary offering by two prominent names in market data, content and intelligence unlocking significant_**
**_value_**

We bring together two globally recognized companies in capital markets data, content and intelligence, Dealogic and Acuris. The
Acuris Acquisition, which was completed in February 2021, complements our Dealogic offering and helps us deliver a more
comprehensive suite of innovative, differentiated intelligence and data analytics and workflow solutions to our customers. Following
the combination of Dealogic and Acuris, we have an extensive portfolio of leading brands spanning various industries and
geographies, covering a vast spectrum of capabilities to gather, analyze, distribute and harness market data and intelligence.

Our Dealogic offering provides customers with market-leading integrated data, analysis and technology to help them improve
productivity and profitability and facilitate collaboration across a global network to manage resources and target opportunities.
Transforming primary markets through digitization and automation, Dealogic is an established leader in its space, particularly for
over 600 banking and buyside/hedge fund customers, who accounted for 37% and 32% of Dealogic’s customer base, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2020, with legal and other advisers, corporates and private equity firms accounting for 15%, 12%
and 3%, respectively.

Our Acuris offering provides customers with market-leading proprietary information, intelligence and analysis across financial and
M&A markets to help them enhance their market awareness and competitiveness and help them make better investment and
business decisions. As the partner of choice for content and insights to disparate communities of market participants, Acuris caters
to a well-diversified base of over 5,300 customers. Our customers include corporates, legal and other advisors, buyside/hedge
funds, private equity firms and banking clients accounting for 31%, 29%, 21%, 11% and 8% of Acuris’ customer base, respectively,
for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The results generated by our Acuris and Dealogic offerings are fairly balanced, with the Acuris and Dealogic segments accounting
for 60.8% and 39.2% of our pro forma combined revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. Our Recurring
Revenue in each of the Acuris and Dealogic segments was 90.2% and 95.6% of Acuris and Dealogic consolidated revenue,
respectively, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

**_Uniquely positioned in large and growing global financial data and analytics markets_**

We operate in a large and growing global market for financial data and analytics, driven by an increasing demand for actionable,
real-time information, intelligence and insights to maintain and improve competitiveness. Our unique and comprehensive multibrand offering across Dealogic and Acuris software and services positions us strongly to address our customers’ market
intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. See “Business—Our Content, Technology and Services.”

We believe there are compelling growth opportunities in this space. According to management estimates based on external
sources, the total addressable market for financial information was estimated to be approximately $33 billion in 2019 and was
expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% between 2019 and 2022 following years of consistent growth. We anticipate that
the global market for financial data, intelligence and analytics will benefit from several trends, including: (i) rapidly evolving
regulatory requirements for financial institutions and corporates, including requirements to report more frequently and requirements
relating to risk management and real-time tracking, (ii) the growing complexity and speed of global financial markets fueling the
demand for real-time data and analytics and the need to proactively manage risk, (iii) rising demand for personalized, targeted
market intelligence and analytical tools and (iv) the increasing adoption of technology, natural language processing and AI-driven
solutions to improve efficiency. The volatile market environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need
to strictly and reliably monitor trades and transactions and manage risks, creating an environment that we expect would be
beneficial to the financial data and analytics market.

**_Diversified, loyal customers cultivated through differentiated long-term commercial model_**

We have a large and expanding customer base, including blue-chip institutions across diversified end markets, and a strong,
longstanding presence among financial institutions. We serve over 6,000 customers (including customers added through the
Backstop Acquisition) and over 150,000 users, including (i) investment banks (excluding sales, trading and research), (ii) legal and
other advisors, (iii) buyside/hedge fund customers (iv) sales trading and research units at investment banks, (v) corporates and
(vi) private equity firms. These categories of customers contributed 36%, 20%, 16%, 12%, 10% and 6% of our pro forma combined
revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our customers are spread globally, with revenue from EMEA, the
U.S and APAC accounting for 42%, 40% and 18% of our revenue, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro
forma combined basis. This diversity of customers reduces our dependence on any factors or trends specific to a single industry,
region or customer size.

Our products are also embedded in subscriber workflows and are mission-critical to originating opportunities for our customers
and driving key decisions relating to M&A transactions and equity issuances across a range of markets. This characteristic, along

92


-----

with our focus on long-term contracts and our customers’ needs, has resulted in our high customer retention rate of 95% on a pro
forma combined basis as of September 30, 2021. This has also resulted in long-standing customer relationships. For Dealogic, the
top 10 customers have been with us for over 30 years, the top 11 to 50 customers have been with us for over 25 years and the top
51 to 150 customers have been with us for over 17 years. For Acuris, 98% of our top 50 customers have been with us for over 7
years and many of them have been with us for over 15 years. Our Total Contract Value, which we define as Annual Contract Value
multiplied by the Weighted Average Contract Term, was $954.0 million as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021
on a pro forma combined basis.

**_Attractive financial profile with highly visible revenue, high margins and robust cash flow generation_**

We derive most of our revenue from long-term subscription-based license contracts, which have provided us with highly visible
revenue streams. Our standard contract for new customers is for a term of one to five years and we consistently aim to improve
our contract terms at renewal. Our Weighted Average Contract Term was 2.26 years and our customer retention rate was 95% as
of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis. On a pro forma combined basis, our
Recurring Revenue accounted for 90% (91% after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our revenue for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021.

We also benefit from strong and stable margins, with a Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination
Synergies including Backstop) of 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. In addition to growing Recurring Revenue,
lower operating costs through continuous cost optimization efforts have contributed to our industry-leading and consistent
profitability.

We enjoy strong cash flow generation and maintain a prudent amount of leverage, with low capital expenditures and structurally
negative working capital due to our billings for subscriptions being made annually in advance. Our net cash inflow from operating
activities as a percentage of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA was 109% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

**_Industry-leading multi-brand portfolio of differentiated, innovative products and services_**

We have developed, maintain and continue to grow an extensive portfolio of industry-leading software and services with
sophisticated and differentiated functionalities and innovative features. Our proprietary software, data and analysis and workflow
management tools are essential to key decision-makers and participants in the global financial markets, including investors,
issuers, investment banks and legal and other advisors. We believe that our business has been historically resilient during
downturns because of the mission-critical nature of our software and services to our customers, in particular during times of market
volatility, and the ability of our software to save costs and drive operational efficiencies.

We believe that our multi-brand software portfolio, which we can tailor to the needs of a broad range of customers in size and
complexity, is a key reason for our competitive success. We continuously innovate our software and build out complementary
products and modules that integrate seamlessly with our main software, thereby delivering additional incremental value to our
customers. For instance, Selerity, our proprietary AI technology acquired in 2019, is catalyzing the development of our nextgeneration products and is bringing machine-learning capabilities to our systems. Also, in 2020, we released a new entitlements
platform and data portal, nearly doubled the number of our public APIs from 7 to 13 and added $6.8 million of ACV and $7.7 million
of TCV in new API sales from 146 new clients. As a result of this broad portfolio and clear brand positioning, we are able to serve
customers with a variety of market intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. In addition, as our
customers grow in size and complexity, we are able to continue to provide them with the right level of software to meet their evolving
needs.

We use a significant portion of our research and development expenditure to differentiate ourselves from our competition, by
expanding our product coverage, improving the user experience of and technology underpinning our software and focusing on
creating tools that personalize insights, automate processes and drive efficiency gains for our customers.

**_Proven operator with differentiated value creation capabilities, playbooks and track record_**

We and the ION Group, which we are a part of, are proven operators of market intelligence and analytics software businesses,
with a track record of successfully acquiring, integrating and improving businesses. We deploy a dual track strategy of acquisition
and organic growth, with our acquisitions geared towards bridging the gaps in our functional footprint or expanding our addressable
market segments while we constantly attempt to innovate and improve both acquired and existing products. We apply the “ION
Playbook” to the businesses that we acquire, leveraging the ION Group’s knowhow as an experienced and lean industrial operator
to deliver greater value for customers through increasing engagement, driving digitization and enabling automation. This has
resulted in a re-engineering of our acquired businesses across three dimensions: (i) organizational re-engineering to remove
unnecessary middle-management layers and remove duplicative and overlapping functions to attract top talent, (ii) commercial re
93


-----

engineering to enhance the visibility of our revenue and improve our contractual terms, including the transition to our standard
multi-year contract and (iii) technological re-engineering to innovate and improve the quality of our software.

Dealogic, which we acquired in 2017, is an illustrative example. Dealogic has performed strongly under our ownership. The
percentage of Dealogic’s Recurring Revenue to total revenue was 94%, 95% and 93%, and 96% for the years ended December
31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 (preacquisition), the Weighted Average Contract Term of our Dealogic contracts was 1.6 years while the Total Contract Value for
Dealogic was $208 million. The Weighted Average Contract Term of Dealogic’s contracts was 1.7 years, 2.2 years, 2.8 years and
3.1 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 and the Total
Contract Value for Dealogic increased to $233 million, $319 million, $417 million and $475 million, respectively, as of such dates.
We also improved the quality of our Dealogic software, with the number of OriginatION and DistributION product bugs raised per
year decreasing from 480 and 481, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 to 180 and 75, respectively, for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2021.

Acuris, which the ION Group acquired in July 2019 and which we acquired from our affiliate group, the ION Group, in February
2021 following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, is another illustrative example of how our business can drive strong
performance. The Weighted Average Contract Term of Acuris’ contracts was 1.4 years, 1.6 years, 1.7 years and 1.8 years,
respectively, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and twelve months ended September 30, 2021, and the Total Contract Value
for Acuris increased from $334 million in 2018 to $382 million in 2019 to $424 in 2020 and $479 in the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021. The percentage of Acuris’ Recurring Revenue to total revenue was 88% for the period from April 18, 2019 to
December 31, 2019, 89% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 88% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. The
number of Acuris customers was 5,131, 5,295 and 5,391 as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and the twelve months ended September
30, 2021, respectively. Acuris also established strong customer engagement, with email click throughs of 12,407 and 19,158 as of
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Acuris’ content production also increased from 175,490 articles and
reports in 2019 to 185,459 in 2020, with approximately 30% of such content being proprietary and 70% curated in each year.

**_Highly experienced management team_**

We are managed by a proven management team, which comprises individuals with significant industry experience and provides
leadership across all functional areas of our business. Led by our CEO Jody Drulard, who has approximately 25 years of
experience with Dealogic, our senior management team has an average of almost 20 years of industry experience and a deep
knowledge of our diverse software portfolio, which we believe provides us with a significant competitive advantage.

**Our Growth Strategy**

**_Continue to harness and enhance our industry-leading portfolio to remain our customers’ partner of choice_**

Our vision is to empower our customers’ decision-making with unique, easily accessible insights and personalized content. As
markets have globalized and become more complex, the amount of financial and operational data has grown exponentially,
increasing the risk that management and execution decisions do not account for this data. With our systems holding an extensive
range of market intelligence and analysis, we intend to provide our customers with data in real time and in a user-friendly format,
enhanced with advanced analytics and visualization tools to enable our customers to make data-driven decisions. We aim to
provide a single-window solution to our customers by bringing together data, analytics and insights on the same platform, enabling
market participants to make optimal decisions in an increasingly competitive environment.

As part of this vision, Dealogic’s mission is to continue transforming primary markets and the way financial firms operate through
digitization and automation and innovative workflow solutions. Acuris’ mission is to be the financial and M&A community’s partner
of choice for market data, intelligence and insights.

We intend to continue differentiating ourselves from our competition, by expanding our product coverage, improving the user
experience and technology of our existing software and focusing on creating tools that personalize insights, automate processes
and drive efficiency gains for our customers. We intend to continue developing and marketing new products that transform data
into real-time insights and add value through integrated workflow solutions. We believe that our continuing focus on digitization
and automation, combined with our ability to deliver personalized, targeted information that saves time and effort, will enable key
decision-makers in the global financial markets to drive optimal decisions.

**_Capitalize on synergies and cross-selling and up-selling opportunities_**

We believe the combination of Dealogic and Acuris is unlocking and will continue to help unlock significant synergies, as reflected
in our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) of $360.3 million for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2021.

94


-----

We also believe the combination provides opportunities to increase our wallet share with existing customers and attract them to
use other software and services across our portfolio. The global demand for real-time data, intelligence and analysis, as well as
visibility and tracking capabilities in connection with organizational workflows, capital markets issuances, M&A deals and a variety
of other transactions has increased over time and, in times of uncertainty, will continue to increase. These needs create crossselling and up-selling opportunities across our customer base, which we intend to pursue through unified account coverage,
broader product coverage and joint sales campaigns for both suites of Dealogic and Acuris offerings, thereby becoming an even
greater and more integral partner to our customers.

**_Engage and nurture our growing customer and user community_**

We believe that there are several long-term network effects resulting from our scaled customer and user community. As our
community grows, more data will be generated which can be used to derive better and more accurate insights to provide to our
customers. In addition, an increasing number of customers could provide us with several additional revenue opportunities through
positive network effects by connecting disparate financial communities across global markets.

As we foster these network effects, we believe that the size, diversity and loyalty of our community provides and will continue to
provide us with a competitive advantage.

**_Pursue accretive acquisitions_**

We have grown our business, in part, through acquisitions, such as the formative acquisition of Dealogic in 2017, the acquisition
of Selerity in 2019 and the Acuris Acquisition completed in February 2021. We will selectively consider additional accretive
acquisitions from time to time, such as our recent acquisition of Backstop, an established leader in alternative investment software,
with a large and growing total addressable market, a differentiated customer footprint and a broad and high-quality product offering
in front and middle office. See “Summary—Recent Developments.” Generally, we consider targets that we believe will bridge gaps
in our functional footprint, expand our addressable market segments by adding to our product portfolio and enhancing our ability
to cross-sell or provide innovative applications or technologies that can integrate into our existing offerings. Through our proven
“ION Playbook,” which includes product, commercial and organizational re-engineering, we constantly attempt to seamlessly
integrate and improve acquired businesses and products in line with our customers’ expectations, thereby adding to our value
proposition. Additionally, we generally seek profitable targets that provide opportunities to generate meaningful cost-saving and
revenue-enhancing synergies. While we may finance these acquisitions with additional debt, we have a financial policy of
maintaining sustainable and disciplined leverage levels.

**Corporate History**

ION Analytics is the result of the business combination of two globally recognized companies in capital markets data, content and
intelligence, Dealogic and Acuris.

Dealogic was founded in 1982, initially trading as Computasoft. In 2017, the ION Group acquired, through the Parent Guarantor,
a controlling stake in Dealogic and recapitalized it. In 2019, the ION Group acquired the Acuris business, an acquisition which
offered multiple channels for cross- and up-selling with Dealogic and the acceleration of product innovation to capture substantial
revenue opportunities. On February 16, 2021, following an internal reorganization, the Parent Guarantor became the holding
company of the Acuris business.

**Our Content, Technology and Services**

We collect and provide mission-critical data and insights to key decision-makers in the financial markets, including investors,
issuers, investment banks and legal and other advisors. We cater to the diverse and growing needs of these market participants
by delivering market-leading intelligence, data analytics, financial news reporting and editorial content through our high-quality
proprietary software applications, databases and visualization tools.

**_Dealogic_**

Our Dealogic software provides integrated content, analysis and technology to help financial firms improve their competitiveness,
productivity and profitability. The Dealogic platform, the first platform for SPAC sponsors and sell-side professionals to source
deals and optimize de-SPAC structures, connects our users across a single, global network, allowing them to break through silos
to collaborate, manage resources and target opportunities. Among other functionalities, our platform enables users to coordinate
activities in investment banking and capital markets, execute deals and organize events while seamlessly handling compliance
requirements in the context of syndicates and sales, trading and research, effectively process the reconciliation and valuation of
resources, which is particularly helpful to investment managers and drive better management and execution decisions through
readily accessible data in an easy to review and consume form enhanced with advanced analytics and visualization tools.

-----

Dealogic has over 30 years’ experience serving the finance industry and is the largest network connecting investment banks
globally. As of September 30, 2021, we had over 784 customers for our Dealogic products.

Dealogic provides industry-standard capital markets data, workflow software and AI solutions across three core product areas:

_OriginatION_

Our OriginatION products provide capital markets data, research and insights to help our customers identify and analyze new
business opportunities and develop and execute firm strategy. Our market intelligence gives our customers a consistent view of
the market, allowing them to assess current and prospective issuers, how likely they are to issue and how likely a bank is to win
the mandate. From a strategic resource allocation perspective, customers can determine which region, sector, product and client
to prioritize or commit resources to. Customers can also achieve optimal coverage prioritization (e.g. which meeting to send a
coverage banker to), deal selection (e.g. which bidder to support in an M&A auction) and capital commitment in the context of
specific transactions. The integrity of our content is maintained to high standards through rigorous checks, annual forums with
market participants, regular reconciliation with key global, regional and domestic banks and a formal process to resolve
discrepancies regarding deal inclusion and treatment. Our customers in this product area primarily include banks, investors,
advisors and corporates.

_DistributION_

Our DistributION products provide workflow solutions to facilitate the execution of equity capital markets deals for our customers.
We also provide automated tools to support roadshows and events and offer a suite of risk management and compliance solutions.

_Selerity_

On September 25, 2019, we acquired Selerity, a financial technology company providing leading content and data analytics for the
world’s largest asset managers, banks, exchanges and retail brokers. Its proprietary AI is designed to analyze large amounts of
unstructured data and helps automate inefficient workflows. Its proven technology and deep expertise in AI are catalyzing the
development of our next-generation products and is bringing machine-learning capabilities to the systems that power our solutions.
Our customers in this product area primarily include banks, buyside traders, advisors, and the media.

**_Acuris_**

Acuris offers proprietary content, analysis and insights through a portfolio of leading brands to customers across asset classes and
their advisers, including private equity, credit and infrastructure funds and other investors, brokers and financial advisers and
corporates. Operating across five key financial areas, Acuris delivers user-friendly proprietary information and data aggregation,
combined with industry-leading expert research and analysis, to enhance customers’ market awareness and competitiveness.
Acuris also provides real-time information, breaking intelligence and analysis (including tailored research and analysis over credit,

**Licensing and Recurring Revenue Generation**

Subscription-based licenses of our software provide the customer with the right to license our software, to our support and to
certain enhancements during the term of the subscription license. We have rolled out subscription-based licenses for all our
software and encourage new and existing customers to use subscription-based licenses.

� _Dealogic: Dealogic contracts are long-term (three to seven years, with most falling within the three to five year range)_
platform licenses and enterprise in nature. We price our products based on a model that considers many variables,
including whether a client has a global, regional or national footprint. We also offer discounts which are modelled on
primarily the length of the initial term and not the number of products a client includes under its platform license. For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Dealogic Recurring Revenue (primarily from subscription-based licenses)
generated $177.5 million in revenue, representing 95.6% of overall revenue generated by Dealogic.

� _Acuris: Acuris subscribers are generally committed for one year. Once a long-term contract is in place, we upsell through_
new additional products and functionality. We price our Acuris products on a team or division per location basis, offering
more flexible pricing as more locations and teams are included. Other variables that may affect pricing include the current
spend of a subscriber with the respective product, pricing of comparable teams, number of product editions being
subscribed to, competitor landscape, the size or potential size of the user base and the length of the client’s commitment.
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Acuris Recurring Revenue (primarily from subscription-based
licenses) generated $259.7 million in revenue, representing 90.2% of overall revenue generated by Acuris.

Our standard subscription-based license contract, to which we aim to sign every new customer and transition most of our existing
customers, is for a term of three to five years for Dealogic and one year for Acuris and allows us to bill our customers annually in
advance.

We typically price our licenses based on both functionality and number of access rights required. We often attract customers
subscribing for one license and then up-sell them other products, expanded functionality, integrations and uses to generate higher
revenue from them.

**Customers**

We operate a scalable business model with high visibility and Recurring Revenue built on long-term relationships with customers.
We benefit from a large and diversified customer base. Our customers include some of the world’s leading companies and financial
institutions, including large multi-nationals and mid-size corporate customers, asset managers, advisors and corporates.

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis, we had over 6,000 customers globally,
including customers added through the Backstop Acquisition (with over 150,000 users in those customer organizations, based on
management estimates).

We serve customers in various industry sectors and regions. For the year ended December 31, 2020, on a pro forma combined
basis, EMEA, the US and APAC accounted for 42%, 40% and 18%, respectively, of our revenue. Our top ten customers contributed
26% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.

**Sales and Marketing**

We advertise digitally and participate in trade events to showcase our software. We run marketing campaigns through various
channels and our sales force in empowered to follow up on the leads generated through such campaigns and other organic leads.

-----

Each member of our sales force is encouraged to make sales across our entire portfolio. We incentivize our sales force based on
financial targets, which we believe leads to more sustainable earnings. As of and for the twelve months ended September 30,
2021, on a pro forma combined basis, we had over 250 dedicated sales and marketing personnel (including sales operations and
lead generation) who source and progress new customer opportunities and nurture existing customer relationships while looking
for up-selling and cross-selling opportunities.

In addition, as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis, we had over 730 data
and product specialists and over 370 editorial specialists who help strengthen our relationships with our customers while looking
for up-selling and cross-selling opportunities. We believe that our focus on our customer needs has helped us achieve a high
customer retention rate of 95% as of and for the twelve months September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis.

**Acquisitions**

ION Analytics is the result of the business combination of two globally recognized companies in capital markets data, content, and
intelligence: Dealogic and Acuris. This business combination enables multiple channels for cross- and up-selling and acceleration
of product innovation to capture substantial revenue opportunities. From time to time, we may consider further acquisitions in line
with our strategic objectives, such as the Backstop Acquisition. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative
and institutional investment industries. It specializes in integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment
and operations firms to build and source manager relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital
and service and communicate with investors. We believe that the Backstop Acquisition will benefit our business by further
enhancing our data and technology offering in the large and growing alternative asset space, deepening our customer relationships
with asset managers and accessing new users and customers among asset allocators. See “—Corporate History,” “—Our Growth
_Strategy—Pursue accretive acquisitions” and “Summary—Recent Developments.”_

**Research and Development**

We depend on research and development to adapt our software to changing market needs and produce new and innovative
software for our customers. We have invested significantly in research and development, having spent more than $160 million in
research and development expenses (including expenses of our subsidiaries prior to their acquisition) in the period between
December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2021.

Our software is developed in-house with user experience and customer requirements as the top priorities. Our research and
development leverages contemporary software languages. We follow an agile software development methodology and design
products aligned to foundational principles across the ION Group to ensure consistency, integration and re-usability. Internal
development allows us to maintain complete technical control over the design and development of our software. Accordingly, we
have dedicated a large portion of our employees to software research and development.

We believe our level of investment and commitment to research and development provide us with a competitive advantage over
our competitors.

**Intellectual Property**

We regard certain aspects of our internal operations, software and documentation as proprietary, and rely on a combination of
contract, copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. Our policy is to protect all of
our significant technologies by seeking trademarks and/or other intellectual property rights and, where required, defending and
enforcing our intellectual property rights. In addition, we have implemented a variety of practical measures aimed at providing
additional security for our intellectual property. For example, we include non-compete and non-solicitation clauses in the contracts
of our key employees and in the acquisition agreements with our strategic partners relating to our majority-owned subsidiaries. In
addition, we use repositories for our source code, which may be accessed only by authorized individuals and only in certain
circumstances. We believe that, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry, trade secret
and copyright protection is less significant than factors such as the knowledge, ability and experience of our employees, frequent

software product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of assistance services. See “Risk Factors—A failure to protect our
_intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, could adversely affect our_
_business” and “—Our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent our competitors from offering similar software and data content_
_products.”_

**Offices, Property and Facilities**

In addition to our R&D facilities, we maintain multiple offices in the United States and internationally. We do not own any real
property and lease all of our facilities.

**Regulation**

We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern security and data privacy, anti-bribery and corruption, antitrust, public
sector contracting, employment, export control and sanctions, information technology, internet commerce, health and safety,
environmental, and financial and tax matters in the jurisdictions where we operate. Compliance with these regulations imposes
significant costs on us and requires us to dedicate significant personnel resources. See “Risk Factors—We may be adversely
_affected by new legislation and guidance as well as changes in legislation and regulation, which may affect how we provide software_
_and how we collect and use information” and “Risk Factors—We are subject to laws and regulations regulating our relationship_
_with employees, including health and safety laws and regulations, which could result in litigation, liabilities or cost increases.”_

**Environmental Matters**

We believe we do not have any material environmental compliance costs or environmental liabilities.

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance coverage, through our affiliate ION Investment Group Limited, for, among other things, commercial general
liability, public and products liability, employers’ liability, directors’ and officers’ liability and technology and cybersecurity risks. We
believe that our current insurance coverage is appropriate for our business, in respect of the level and applicable excesses and
deductibles. We do not have any material outstanding insurance claims.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are, from time to time, involved in legal proceedings, claims, audits and investigations that have arisen in the ordinary course
of business. The outcome of any such matters is subject to future resolution, including the uncertainties of litigation. Based on
information currently known to us and after consultation with outside legal counsel, management believes that the ultimate
resolution of any such matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position
taken as a whole. See “Risk Factors—Exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and
_inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.”_

Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 4.75:1.00 and greater than or equal to 4.50:1.00, and (D) 3.25% if the Consolidated
First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is less than 4.50:1.00).

The Borrowers must pay a commitment fee on the daily undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility equal to 0.40% (or
0.30% if the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 5.00 to 1.00).

**_Covenants_**

The Existing Term Loan Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to customary affirmative covenants, and incurrencebased negative covenants that are substantially similar to the Dollar Indenture governing the Notes.

The Existing Term Loan Facilities are not subject to any financial maintenance covenant.

The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a maintenance covenant, which is tested at the end of each fiscal quarter when more
than $10.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility is utilized, under which the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio must not be greater
than 9.00:1.

**_Events of Default_**

The Existing Credit Facility Agreement contains provisions governing certain events of default, including, a failure to make payment
of the amounts due, defaults under other agreements evidencing indebtedness over a certain threshold, failure to comply with
covenants or other obligations, material misrepresentations, certain changes of control, certain ERISA events and certain
bankruptcy events. The occurrence of an event of default could result in the acceleration of payment obligations under the Existing
Credit Facility Agreement.

Issue Date, and as further amended, restated or modified from time to time, the “Intercreditor Agreement”).

**_Certain Intercreditor Provisions_**

For purposes of this section with respect to the Intercreditor Agreement, capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined
herein or in “—Certain Definitions” shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in “Description of the Dollar Notes” and
“Description of the Euro Notes.” The Intercreditor Agreement contains certain provisions governing the relationships between or
among the parties subject thereto, including the following:

**_Priority of Claims_**

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under the First Lien Documents, and the Applicable Collateral Agent is taking
action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any
bankruptcy case of any Grantor or any First Lien Claimholder receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other
than the Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of (i) any sale, collection or other liquidation
of any such Shared Collateral received by the Applicable Collateral Agent or any First Lien Claim Holder on account of such
enforcement of rights, (ii) any distribution in respect of any Shared Collateral received in any Bankruptcy Case of any Grantor or
(iii) any payment received by such First Lien Claimholder pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared
Collateral (subject, in the case of any such distribution or payment, to the sentence immediately following clause (iii) below) (all
proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Shared Collateral and all proceeds of any such distribution or
payment being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”) shall be applied in the following order:

(i) _first, to the payment of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the_
terms of any First Lien Collateral Document, including all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by each
Collateral Agent;

(ii) _second, subject to any Impairments or Declined Liens, to the payment in full of the First Lien Obligations of_
each series on a ratable basis, with such Proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given
series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Collateral Documents;

(iii) _third, any balance of such Proceeds remaining after the application pursuant to preceding clauses (i) and (ii),_
to the Grantors, their successors or assigns from time to time, or to whomever may be lawfully entitled to

107


-----

receive the same, including pursuant to any applicable intercreditor agreement, if in effect, or otherwise, as a
court of competent jurisdiction may direct.

If, despite the provisions described above, any First Lien Claimholder shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its
portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled, such First Lien Claimholder shall hold such
payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Claimholders for distribution as described above.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the intention of the First Lien Claimholders of each series is that the holders of First Lien
Obligations of such series (and not the First Lien Claimholders of any other series) (i) bear the risk of any determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the First Lien Obligations of such series are unenforceable, (y) any of the First Lien
Obligations of such series do not have a valid and perfected security interest in any of the Collateral, and/or (z) any intervening
security interest exists securing any other obligations on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such series of First Lien
Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other series of First Lien Obligations and (ii) not take into account the existence
of any Collateral for any other series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the
foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such series). In the event of
any Impairment with respect to any series of First Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the
holders of such series of First Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such series of First Lien Obligations shall be
modified so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the series of such First Lien Obligations subject
to such Impairment.

The First Lien Obligations of any series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the then existing First Lien Documents be
increased or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth above or the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement defining the relative rights of the First Lien Claimholders of any series.

Notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing any series of
First Lien Obligations granted on the Shared Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of the UCC of any jurisdiction, or any
other applicable law or the First Lien Documents or any defect or deficiencies in the Liens securing the First Lien Obligations of
any series or any other circumstance whatsoever, each First Lien Claimholder has agreed that the Liens securing each series of
First Lien Obligations on any Shared Collateral shall be of equal priority.

**_Actions with Respect to Shared Collateral; Prohibition on Contesting Liens_**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement (i) only the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act or refrain from acting with respect to
Shared Collateral, (ii) the Applicable Collateral Agent shall act only on the instructions of the Applicable Representative and shall
not follow any instructions with respect to such Shared Collateral from any Non-Controlling Representative (or any other First Lien
Claimholder other than the Applicable Representative) and (iii) no Other First Lien Claimholder shall or shall instruct any Collateral
Agent to, and any other Collateral Agent that is not the Applicable Collateral Agent shall not, commence any judicial or nonjudicial
foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt
any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its
security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, Shared Collateral (including with respect to
any other intercreditor agreement with respect to Shared Collateral), whether under any First Lien Collateral Document (other than
the First Lien Collateral Documents applicable to the Applicable Collateral Agent), applicable law or otherwise, it being agreed that
only the Applicable Collateral Agent, acting in accordance with the applicable First Lien Collateral Documents, shall be entitled to
take any such actions or exercise any remedies with respect to such Shared Collateral at such time.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens securing each series of First Lien Obligations with respect to any Shared Collateral,
the Applicable Collateral Agent (acting on the instructions of the Applicable Representative) may deal with such Shared Collateral
as if such Applicable Collateral Agent had a senior and exclusive Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Non-Controlling
Representative, Non-Controlling Claimholder or Collateral Agent that is not the Applicable Collateral Agent will contest, protest or
object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Representative or the
Controlling Claimholders or any other exercise by the Applicable Collateral Agent, the Applicable Representative or the Controlling
Claimholders of any rights and remedies relating to such Shared Collateral. The foregoing shall not be construed to limit the rights
and priorities of any First Lien Claimholder, Collateral Agent or Representative with respect to any Collateral not constituting Shared
Collateral.

Each of the Collateral Agents (other than the Credit Agreement Collateral Agent) and the Representatives (other than the Credit
Agreement Representative) shall agree that it will not accept any Lien on any Collateral for the benefit of any series of Other First
Lien Obligations (other than funds deposited for the satisfaction, discharge or defeasance of any Other First Lien Agreement) other
than pursuant to the First Lien Collateral Documents. No Grantor shall grant or permit or suffer to exist any Lien on any asset or
property to secure any series of First Lien Obligations unless (i) it has granted a Lien on such asset or property to secure each
other series of First Lien Obligations or (ii) such Lien is a Declined Lien.

108


-----

Each of the First Lien Claimholders has agreed that it will not (and waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in
contesting the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the First Lien
Claimholders in all or any part of the Collateral; provided that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent
or impair (i) the rights of any Collateral Agent or any Representative to enforce the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) the rights of any
First Lien Claimholders to contest or support any other Person in contesting the enforceability of any Lien purporting to secure
obligations not constituting First Lien Obligations.

**_No Interference; Payment Over_**

Each First Lien Claimholder has agreed that (i) it will not challenge or question or support any other Person in challenging or
questioning in any proceeding the validity or enforceability of any First Lien Obligations of any series or any First Lien Collateral
Document or the validity, attachment, perfection or priority of any Lien under any First Lien Collateral Document or the validity or
enforceability of the priorities, rights or duties established by or other provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, (ii) it will not take
or cause to be taken any action the purpose or intent of which is, or could be, to interfere, hinder or delay, in any manner, whether
by judicial proceedings or otherwise, any sale, transfer or other disposition of the Shared Collateral by the Applicable Collateral
Agent, (iii) except as provided under “—Priority of Claims,” it shall have no right to and shall not otherwise (A) direct the Applicable
Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder to exercise, and shall not exercise, any right, remedy or power with respect to
any Shared Collateral or (B) consent to, or object to, the exercise by, or any forbearance from exercising by, the Applicable
Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder represented by it of any right, remedy or power with respect to any Shared
Collateral, (iv) it will not institute any suit or assert in any suit, bankruptcy, insolvency or other proceeding any claim against the
Applicable Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder represented by it seeking damages from or other relief by way of
specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Shared Collateral and (v) it will not attempt, directly or indirectly,
whether by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to challenge the enforceability of any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement;
provided that nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any of the Applicable
Collateral Agent or any other First Lien Claimholder to (i) enforce the Intercreditor Agreement or (ii) contest or support any other
Person in contesting the enforceability of any Lien purporting to secure obligations not constituting First Lien Obligations.

Each First Lien Claimholder has agreed that if it shall obtain possession of any Shared Collateral or shall realize any proceeds or
payment in respect of any Shared Collateral, pursuant to any First Lien Collateral Document or by the exercise of any rights
available to it under applicable law or in any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies
(including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the Discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it
shall hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other First Lien Claimholders having a security interest in
such Shared Collateral and promptly transfer any such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment, as the case may be, to the
Applicable Collateral Agent, to be distributed by such Applicable Collateral Agent in accordance with the section entitled “—Priority
_of Claims.”_

**_Automatic Release of Liens_**

If, (i) at any time the Applicable Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral
resulting in a sale or disposition thereof or (ii) a sale or other disposition of any Shared Collateral is consummated which is permitted
by the terms of the documents governing each series of First Lien Obligations at the time of such sale or disposition, then (whether
or not any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other Collateral Agents for the
benefit of each series of First Lien Claimholders upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged upon
the final conclusion of such disposition as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Applicable Collateral Agent on such
Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any Proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be
allocated and applied in accordance with the provisions described under “—Priority of Claims.”

**_Certain Agreements with Respect to Bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceedings_**

The Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any proceeding under
the Bankruptcy Code or any other Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law by or against any
Grantor or any of its subsidiaries.

If any Grantor shall become subject to a case (a “Bankruptcy Case”) under the Bankruptcy Code or any other bankruptcy law or
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to
be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of
any other bankruptcy law or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any equivalent provision of
any other bankruptcy law, each First Lien Claimholder (other than any Controlling Claimholder or any Representative of any
Controlling Claimholder) has agreed that it will not raise any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral
securing the same (“DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless a
Representative of the Controlling Claimholders shall then oppose or object to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or

109


-----

use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for
the benefit of the Controlling Claimholders, each Non-Controlling Claimholder will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared
Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Claimholders (other than any Liens of any First Lien Claimholders
constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu
with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Claimholders, each
Non-Controlling Claimholder will confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral), in each case so long as (i) the First
Lien Claimholders of each series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Shared Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including
proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-à-vis all the other First Lien
Claimholders (other than any Liens of the First Lien Claimholders constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the
commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, (ii) the First Lien Claimholders of each series are granted Liens on any additional collateral
pledged to any First Lien Claimholders as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing or use of cash
collateral, with the same priority vis-à-vis the First Lien Claimholders (other than any Liens of any First Lien Claimholders
constituting DIP Financing Liens), (iii) if any amount of such DIP Financing or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the First
Lien Obligations, such amount is applied consistent the provisions described under “—Priority of Claims,” and (iv) if any First Lien
Claimholders are granted adequate protection with respect to the First Lien Obligations subject hereto, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied consistent
the provisions described under “—Priority of Claims”; provided that the First Lien Claimholders of each series shall have a right to
object to the grant of a Lien to secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the First Lien Claimholders
of such series or its Representative that shall not constitute Shared Collateral; provided, further, that the First Lien Claimholders
receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other First Lien Claimholder receiving adequate protection comparable to any
adequate protection granted to such First Lien Claimholders in connection with a DIP Financing or use of cash collateral.

**_Reinstatement_**

In the event that any of the First Lien Obligations shall be paid in full and such payment or any part thereof shall subsequently, for
whatever reason (including an order or judgment for disgorgement of a preference under the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar law,
or the settlement of any claim in respect thereof), be required to be returned or repaid, the terms and conditions of the First Lien
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall be fully applicable thereto until all such First Lien Obligations shall again have been paid
in full in cash.

**_Insurance and Condemnation Awards_**

As between the First Lien Secured Parties, the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting at the direction of the Applicable Authorized
Representative) shall have the right to adjust or settle any insurance policy or claim covering or constituting Shared Collateral in
the event of any loss thereunder and to approve any award granted in any condemnation or similar proceeding affecting the Shared
Collateral.

**_Refinancings_**

The First Lien Obligations of any series may be refinanced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent
(except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the refinancing transaction under any Secured Credit Document) of
any First Lien Secured Party of any other series, all without affecting the priorities provided for under the First Lien Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions of the First Lien Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; provided that the Authorized
Representative and Collateral Agent of the holders of any such refinancing indebtedness shall have executed a joinder agreement
on behalf of the holders of such refinancing indebtedness.

**_Amendments to First Lien Security Documents_**

Without the prior written consent of each other Collateral Agent, each Collateral Agent has agreed that no First Lien Security
Document may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or entered into to the extent such amendment,
restatement, supplement or modification, or the terms of any new First Lien Security Document, would contravene any of the terms
of the First Lien Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Similar Liens and Agreements_**

The parties have agreed that it is their intention that the Collateral be identical for all First Lien Claimholders; provided, that the
Intercreditor Agreement will not be violated with respect to any particular series if the First Lien Document for such series prohibits
the Collateral Agent for that series from accepting a Lien on such asset or property or such Collateral Agent otherwise expressly
declines to accept a Lien on such asset or property (any such prohibited or declined Liens with respect to a particular series, a
“Declined Lien”).

110


-----

**_Authority of the Collateral Agent_**

Nothing in the Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to impose any fiduciary or other duty on any Applicable Collateral Agent
to any Non-Controlling Claimholder or give any Non-Controlling Claimholder the right to direct any Applicable Collateral Agent,
except that each Applicable Collateral Agent shall be obligated to distribute proceeds of any Shared Collateral in accordance with
“—Priority of Claims.”

Each Non-Controlling Claimholder has acknowledged and agreed that the Applicable Collateral Agent shall be entitled, for the
benefit of the First Lien Claimholders, to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with any Shared Collateral as provided in the
Intercreditor Agreement and in the First Lien Collateral Documents, as applicable, without regard to any rights to which the NonControlling Claimholders would otherwise be entitled as a result of the First Lien Obligations held by such Non-Controlling
Claimholders. Without limiting the foregoing, each Non-Controlling Claimholder has agreed that none of the Applicable Collateral
Agent, the Applicable Representative or any other First Lien Claimholder shall have any duty or obligation first to marshal or realize
upon any type of Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any of the First Lien Obligations), or to sell, dispose of or
otherwise liquidate all or any portion of such Shared Collateral (or any other Collateral securing any First Lien Obligations), in any
manner that would maximize the return to the Non-Controlling Claimholders, notwithstanding that the order and timing of any such
realization, sale, disposition or liquidation may affect the amount of proceeds actually received by the Non-Controlling Claimholders
from such realization, sale, disposition or liquidation. Each of the First Lien Claimholders has waived any claim it may have against
any Collateral Agent or Representative of any other series of First Lien Obligations or any other First Lien Claimholder of any other
series arising out of (i) any actions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement which any such Collateral Agent, Representative
or any First Lien Claimholder represented by it take or omit to take in accordance with the First Lien Collateral Documents or any
other agreement related thereto or in connection with the collection of the First Lien Obligations or the valuation, use, protection or
release of any security for the First Lien Obligations.

**_Appointment_**

Each Non-Controlling Representative and Collateral Agent that is not the Applicable Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of
each other First Lien Claimholder of the series for whom it is acting, has irrevocably appointed the Applicable Collateral Agent and
any officer or agent of the Applicable Collateral Agent, as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority
in the place and stead of such Non-Controlling Representative, Collateral Agent or First Lien Claimholder, to take any and all
appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and instruments which may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Other First Lien Obligations_**

The Grantors may incur additional indebtedness, which for the avoidance of doubt, includes any indebtedness incurred pursuant
to a Refinancing, and Other First Lien Obligations or Replacement Credit Agreement Obligations after the date hereof that is
secured on an equal and ratable basis with the Liens (other than Declined Liens) securing the then existing First Lien Obligations
(such indebtedness, “Additional First Lien Debt”). Any such Additional First Lien Debt and any series of Other First Lien
Obligations or Replacement Credit Agreement Obligations, as applicable, may be secured by a Lien on a ratable basis, in each
case under and pursuant to the applicable First Lien Collateral Documents of such series, if, and subject to the condition that, the
Additional First Lien Collateral Agent and Additional First Lien Representative of any such Additional First Lien Debt, acting on
behalf of the holders of such Additional First Lien Debt and the holders of such Other First Lien Obligations or Replacement Credit
Agreement Obligations, as applicable, (such Additional First Lien Collateral Agent, Additional First Lien Representative, the holders
in respect of such Additional First Lien Debt and the holders in respect of such Other First Lien Obligations or other Replacement
Credit Agreement Obligations, as applicable, being referred to as “Additional First Lien Claimholders”) shall become party to
the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Additional Grantors_**

Each person which becomes a Grantor following the execution of the Intercreditor Agreement shall execute and deliver a
counterpart of the joinder supplement attached to the Intercreditor Agreement.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE DOLLAR NOTES**

**General**

In this description, (1) the terms “we,” “us” and “our” each refer to Acuris Finance US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “U.S.
Issuer”), and Acuris Finance S.à r.l., a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing
under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office at 63-65 rue de Merl, L-2146 Luxembourg, Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register under number B 234.205 (the
“Luxembourg Issuer”), (2) the term “Issuer” or “Issuers” in this description refers to the U.S. Issuer and the Luxembourg Issuer
(either individually or collectively, as co-issuers of the Notes, as applicable), (3) the term “Parent Guarantor” means I-Logic
Technologies Bidco Limited, (4) the term “Group” refers to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries, (5) the term “Holdings” means
I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, (6) unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Subsidiary” (including references to “our
Subsidiary”) shall refer to any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, and (7) unless the context otherwise requires, the term
“Restricted Subsidiary” shall refer to any Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor.

For purposes of this description, the $ aggregate principal amount of additional % Senior
Secured Notes due 2030 are referred to as the “New Notes.” The New Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture dated May
13, 2021, as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture dated June 10, 2021 and the second supplemental indenture dated
October 19, 2021, and as further supplemented from time to time, among, inter alios, the Issuers and Lucid Trustee Services
Limited as Trustee and Security Agent, The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch as Paying Agent and The Bank of New York
Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch as Registrar and Transfer Agent (the “Indenture”), pursuant to which the Issuers issued $350,000,000
5.000% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Existing Notes”) issued on May 13, 2021 (the “Existing Notes Issue Date”). The New
Notes constitute “Additional Notes” (as defined under the Indenture) but will not form a single series of debt securities with the
Existing Notes. The New Notes will be issued with different ISINs and CUSIPs than those assigned to the Existing Notes and will
not be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the Existing Notes. The Existing Notes and the New Notes offered hereby
will collectively be referred to in this “Description of the Dollar Notes” as the “Notes.” Copies of the Indenture may be obtained
from the Issuers upon request. The New Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, and the Indenture is not qualified under or subject to, and does not incorporate (by reference
or otherwise), any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”). Application will be made to list
the New Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange. There can be no assurance that this application will be
accepted.

The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Documents does not
purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes
and the Security Documents. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Dollar Notes” section and not otherwise defined
have the meanings set forth in the section “—Certain Definitions.” The Indenture, the Existing Notes and the Guarantees, with
respect to the Existing Notes also are, and the New Notes and the Guarantees with respect to the New Notes will be, subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

The New Notes will be issued on, 2022 pursuant to the Indenture (the “New Notes Issue Date”). The U.S. Issuer and the
Luxembourg Issuer will issue the New Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $ million. The Issuers may, from
time to time after this offering, issue additional Notes under the Indenture (“Additional Notes”) without notice to or the consent of
holders of any Notes. Any offering of Additional Notes would be subject to the covenant described below under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock.” The Existing Notes_
issued on the Existing Notes Issue Date, the New Notes issued on the New Notes Issue Date and any Additional Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture will vote as a single class (except as otherwise described under “—Amendments and
_Waivers”). The Indenture permits the Issuers to designate the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions_
applicable to each series of Additional Notes, which may differ from the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption
provisions applicable to the Existing Notes and the New Notes.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Dollar Notes,” references to
“Notes” shall be deemed to include the Existing Notes and the New Notes as well as any Additional Notes that are actually issued.
Additional Notes that have the same maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions as the Existing Notes will be
treated as the same series as the Existing Notes unless otherwise designated by the Issuers; provided that, a separate CUSIP or
ISIN will be issued for any Additional Notes unless the Existing Notes or New Notes, as applicable, and such Additional Notes are
treated as “fungible” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuers will be entitled to vary the application of certain other
provisions to any series of Additional Notes.

If a holder of New Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuers or the applicable Paying Agent, such Paying Agent will
distribute the payments received of principal of, and, if applicable, interest and premium, if any, on that holder’s New Notes in

116


-----

accordance with those instructions. Distribution of all other payments on the New Notes will be made at the office or agency of
the applicable Paying Agent unless the Issuers elect to make interest payments through such Paying Agent by check mailed to
the holders of New Notes at their addresses set forth in the register of holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if
any, and interest with respect to the New Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by DTC
or their nominee will be made (x) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the holder or holders
thereof or (y) otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of the DTC.

The registered holder of a New Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights
under the Indenture.

The New Notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of $200,000 and any
integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.

The Indenture and the Guarantees thereunder are subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking
enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Certain Definitions—Collateral” summarize the terms of the
Collateral that will secure the Notes.

The net proceeds of this offering of the New Notes sold on the New Notes Issue Date will be used by the Issuers as set forth in
this Offering Memorandum under “Use of Proceeds.”

**Ranking**

The New Notes will be, and the Existing Notes are, joint and several, senior obligations of the Issuers, secured as set forth under
“—Security” and:

� will rank or rank _pari passu_ in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes (including Indebtedness under the Euro Notes and the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement);

� will rank or rank senior in right of payment to future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes, if any;

� will be or are effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing
such Indebtedness; and

� will be or are structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of all non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries.

As of September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Offering, we would have had $2,312 million in
total debt, all of which would have been secured on Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—
_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial position, our ability to operate our_
_business, react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and_
_the Notes Guarantees, pay our other debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments,” “Description of_
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Credit Facility Agreement and “Description of the Euro Notes.”_

Substantially all of the operations of Holdings, the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers are conducted through their Subsidiaries. As
a result, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from the Subsidiaries of Holdings to generate the funds necessary
to meet our outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the
instruments governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Euro Indenture and the Existing Credit Facility Agreement or
other agreements of such Subsidiaries. Holdings’ Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable the
Issuers to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor,
claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuers,

117


-----

including holders of the Notes. The New Notes, therefore, will be, and the Existing Notes are, structurally subordinated to claims
of creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture
contains limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and Restricted Subsidiaries
may incur, and Preferred Stock that the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may issue, such limitations are subject to a number of
significant exceptions.

Each Guarantee of a Guarantor will be, with respect to the New Notes, or is, with respect to the Existing Notes, a general, senior
obligation of such Guarantor secured as forth under “—Security” and:

� will rank or ranks pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not
subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Guarantee (including its guarantee of the Indebtedness under the Euro
Indenture and the Existing Credit Facility Agreement);

� will be or is effectively subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by property
or assets that do not secure the Guarantee to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness;

� will be or is structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of such Guarantor’s
non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and

� will rank or ranks senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of
payment to applicable Guarantee.

Each Guarantee will be, with respect to the New Notes, and each Guarantee is, with respect to the Existing Notes, limited in
amount as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable jurisdiction and defenses generally available to
guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and similar laws, regulations and defenses affecting the
rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.” This includes limiting Guarantees to an amount not to exceed the_
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Indenture or the Guarantees, as it
relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally.

However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—Each Notes Guarantee_
_and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

**Guarantees**

On or around the New Notes Issue Date, the New Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be, and, since the Existing
Notes Issue Date the Existing Notes have been, guaranteed on a senior basis by Holdings and the Parent Guarantor as well as
guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by each of the Restricted Subsidiaries that also guarantee the Obligations under
the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. Each Guarantee will be, with respect to the New Notes, and each Guarantee is, with respect
to the Existing Notes, a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the guaranteed obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees and assigns.

A Guarantee of Holdings or the Parent Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(a) upon the Issuers’ exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance,” or if the Indenture is discharged (including through redemption or repurchase of all the Notes
as a result of satisfaction and discharge or otherwise) as described in “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

118


-----

(b) in relation to the Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor, in accordance with an enforcement sale in compliance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(c) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

A Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(a) upon the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation or dissolution)
of (x) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, if after such transaction the Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor if such
sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation or dissolution) is made
in compliance with the Indenture so long as such Subsidiary Guarantor is also released from its guarantee of
the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and Certain Capital Markets Debt (if applicable);

(b) upon the Issuers designating such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(c) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Existing Notes Issue Date is required to guarantee the
Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” (x) the release
or discharge of the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (or the co-issuer or co-borrower obligation of such
Restricted Subsidiary) of Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary or
(y) the repayment of the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted in the obligation to
guarantee the Notes (except if a release, discharge or repayment is by or as a result of payment in connection
with the enforcement of remedies under such other guarantee of Indebtedness) unless, in each case of clauses
(x) and (y), at the time of such release, discharge or repayment, such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an
obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors”;

(d) upon the Issuers’ exercise of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance,” or if the Indenture is discharged (including through redemption or repurchase of all the Notes
as a result of satisfaction and discharge or otherwise) as described in “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(e) in accordance with an enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(f) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(g) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of the Obligations under
the Existing Credit Facility Agreement (except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection
with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation) unless at the time of such release
or discharge such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would
require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future
_Guarantors”;_

(h) upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event as described in “—Certain Covenants”; or

(i) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

A Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any
foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the Euro Notes or other exercise
of remedies in respect thereof.

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the Guarantors that guarantee the Existing Notes and the Existing
Credit Facility Agreement, and will guarantee the New Notes and the Euro Notes, represented 95% of our Pro Forma Combined

119


-----

excluding consolidation adjustments.

**Terms of the Notes**

, 2030. Each New Note will bear interest at the rate per annum shown on the front cover of this Offering
Memorandum from, 2022 or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable
semi-annually to holders of record at the close of business on the or immediately
preceding the interest payment date on and of each year, beginning on the first interest
payment date following the New Notes Issue Date. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve

are permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness, including any Additional

member of the “Group” (being comprised of Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise;
the relevant Issuer or Guarantor will use commercially reasonable endeavors (not involving the payment of material
amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the parties
benefiting from the Collateral) to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the relevant Issuer
or Guarantor and to overcome any such other limitations to the extent reasonably practicable;

(b) certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body’s or
person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security. Such guarantee
and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received provided that reasonable endeavors (not
involving the payment of material amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the relevant
consent to the extent permissible by law and regulation and such consent has no impact on relationships with third
parties;

(c) the giving of a guarantee or security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required to the extent that it would
incur any legal fees, registration fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such
guarantee or security which are not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties;

(d) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed on the basis that the cost to the Group of providing security shall
be proportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes;

(e) in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or disproportionately costly to grant guarantees or create security over
certain categories of assets in which event such guarantees will not be granted and security will not be taken over such
assets;

121


-----

(f) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement and which may prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security
document; _provided that reasonable endeavors (not involving the payment of material amounts of money or the_
incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) to obtain
consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant Issuer or Guarantor if the relevant asset is material
(regard shall be given, however, to the legitimate interests of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor not to adversely impact
the commercial relationship with such third party);

(g) no member of the Group will be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents to the extent it is not within
the legal capacity of the relevant member of the Group, it results in the security document being null and void or if, in the
reasonable opinion of the directors of the relevant member of the Group, the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties
of their directors or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the
part of any director which, in the case of such conflict, prohibition or risk, cannot be overcome with reasonable endeavors
and at a reasonable cost (in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, appropriate and customary limitation language shall
be added);

(h) subject to the following sentence, perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as
soon as practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement therefor or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Indenture or the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection. Prior to the
occurrence of an automatic acceleration or a notice of acceleration under the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement, it will not be required to take certain steps of perfecting security (including, without limitation, notification of
receivables security to third party debtors unless otherwise provided in the Agreed Security Principles) if, in the
reasonable opinion of the directors (or equivalent) of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor, it would be unduly burdensome
on or restrict the ability of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course
or as otherwise permitted by the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement;

(i) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the applicable grantor, all
security (other than share security over its guarantor company subsidiaries) shall be governed by the law of and secure
assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of such grantor;

(j) no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no consent shall be
required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support debt (not incurred in contemplation of such
acquisition) (“Permitted Acquired Debt”) of such acquired person or encumbering such acquired asset that in each
case is permitted under the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement to remain outstanding; no member of a
target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted under the Indenture or the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security if prevented by the terms of the
documentation governing that Permitted Acquired Debt or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would
give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; and no security will be granted
over any asset secured for the benefit of any such Permitted Acquired Debt to the extent constituting security otherwise
permitted to subsist under the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement;

(k) the maximum granted or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other
applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate
to the level of such fee, taxes and duties;

(l) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Guarantors are not incorporated but perfection action may be
required in the jurisdiction of incorporation of one Guarantor in relation to security granted by another Guarantor
incorporated in a different jurisdiction;

(m) guarantees and security will not be required over the assets of any joint venture (other than in respect of intra-group joint
ventures) if prohibited by a joint venture agreement or similar, provided that commercially reasonable endeavors (not
involving the payment of material amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant
Guarantor if the relevant asset is material (regard shall be given, however, to the legitimate interests of the relevant
Guarantor not to impact the commercial relationship with any third party);

122


-----

(n) no security shall be granted over any minority interest in any entity to the extent this is expressly prohibited by a
shareholders’ agreement / joint venture agreement or similar; provided that commercially reasonable endeavors (not
involving the payment of material amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) to obtain consent to charging any such minority interest shall be used by
the relevant Guarantor if it is material (regard shall be given, however, to the legitimate interests of the relevant Guarantor
not to impact the commercial relationship with any third party);

(o) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection action will be required with respect to assets of
a type not owned by members of the Group;

(p) the Security Agent will hold one set of security for all applicable creditors unless local law requires separate ranking
security for different classes of debt;

(q) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations”; and

(r) notwithstanding any term of the Indenture or Existing Credit Facility Agreement, no loan or other obligation under the
Indenture or Existing Credit Facility Agreement may be, directly or indirectly: (i) guaranteed by any Excluded Subsidiary;
(ii) secured by any assets of an Excluded Subsidiary or by Excluded Property; or (iii) guaranteed by any subsidiary or
secured by a pledge of or security interest in any subsidiary or other asset, if it would result in material adverse U.S. tax
consequences as reasonably determined by the Issuers.

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the extent of the guarantees
and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected in any security taken.

In the future, the lenders under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and/or counterparties to certain future hedging obligations
and any Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral are, with respect to the Existing Notes, and will be, with respect to the New Notes, limited as necessary
to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and defenses generally available to providers of Collateral
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or
benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other
considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations, see “—Certain Limitations on the Validity and
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—_
_Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the Offering of the New Notes. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be
sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure— _The value of the_
_Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and the_
_Notes Guarantees”_ and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—It may be difficult to realize the value of the
_Collateral securing the Notes.”_

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, security, with respect to the Existing Notes, has been, and with respect to the New Notes, will be,
granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment when due of the Issuers’ payment obligations under the Notes and
the Indenture. The Security Documents have been entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security
Agent.

The Indenture provides that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the New Notes will be and the Existing
Notes and the Indenture are, secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture
have been discharged or the Liens have been released as described under “ –Release of Liens.” The validity and enforceability
of the Security Interests are subject to, inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our
_Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by_
_applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” and “Certain Limitations on the Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

123


-----

In the event that Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or the Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement is successful, the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure.”

**Enforcement of Security Interests**

The Security Documents provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since
the holders of the Existing Notes are not, and the holders of the New Notes will not be, a party to the Security Documents, holders
will not, individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The
holders of the Notes may only act through the Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable).

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, holders
of the Existing Notes are, and holders of the New Notes will, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, be entitled
to direct the Trustee to provide instructions to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture
and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the holders of the Existing Notes or the Trustee, and will restrict the ability of
the holders of the New Notes, to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement.
These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have,
and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The holders
of Notes, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting
a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement
(as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with
any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment,
confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security Agent in its name and on its
behalf.

**Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound**

The Indenture provides that the Issuers, the Trustee and the Security Agent are authorized (without any further consent of the
holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture also provides that each holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, is or will be, as applicable, deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and
exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith;

(3) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(4) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(5) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

124


-----

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding
_the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered
into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

**Release of Liens**

Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers, the Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral are entitled to the release of Security
Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to any Person other than Holdings, the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation
_or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the
property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge of the Notes,
as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) if the Issuers designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(7) in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the covenant described below under
“—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”;

(8) in the case of any security interests over intra-group receivables (if any), upon partial repayment or discharge thereof,
the security interests created over such receivables will be automatically reduced in proportion to such partial repayment
or discharge and, upon full repayment or discharge thereof, the security interests shall be automatically and fully released
and of no further effect;

(9) upon the contribution of any claim against the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary, which is
subject to such Security Interests, to the equity of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries;
_provided that, such contribution is made in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;_

(10) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (i) in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) as would not be prohibited under the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

At the request and expense of the Issuers, the Security Agent and, to the extent reasonably requested, the Trustee (if required)
will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any
action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall
be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the security interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

On and after, 2025, the Issuers may redeem the Notes, at their option, in whole at any time or in part from time
to time, upon notice as described under “—Selection and notice,” at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage
of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of
holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
redemption date), if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on of the years set forth below:

**Period** **Redemption price for Notes**

2025 ............................................................................................................................... %

2026 ............................................................................................................................... %

2027 and thereafter ........................................................................................................ 100.000%

In addition, at any time prior to, 2025, the Issuers may redeem the Notes at their option, in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, upon notice as described under “—Selection and notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of the redemption notice, and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to, 2025, upon notice as described
under “—Selection and notice,” the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after
giving effect to any issuance of Additional Notes of such series), with an aggregate amount less than or equal to the cash proceeds
less any underwriting spread paid in cash of one or more Equity Offerings, to the extent (in the case of an Equity Offering by a
direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor) that such cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the common equity capital of
the Parent Guarantor or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor through an
issuance of Capital Stock by the Parent Guarantor, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount
thereof) equal to %, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date); provided, however, that, at least 50% of the original aggregate principal
amount of the Existing Notes (excluding any Additional Notes) must remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption
(except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Indenture concurrently with or
following the Equity Offering); _provided,_ _further, that for purposes of calculating the principal amount of the Notes able to be_
redeemed with such cash proceeds of such Equity Offering or Equity Offerings, such amount shall include only the principal amount
of the Notes to be redeemed plus the premium on such Notes to be redeemed; provided, further, that such redemption shall occur
within 180 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering is consummated.

At any time, in connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase any series of Notes (including pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (each as defined below)), if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes of such series are purchased by the Issuers, or any third party purchasing or acquiring such Notes in lieu of the Issuers, the
Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” given not more than 30
days following such purchase, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price paid to holders in such purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to (but not including) the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. The redemption date
of any redemption that is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such redemption
may not occur and any notice with respect to such redemption may be modified or rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed (which may exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice in such case). In addition, such
notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Issuer by providing
notice to the noteholders.

126


-----

The Issuers or their affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be made through
open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuers or any such affiliates may
determine.

The Notes of any series may be optionally redeemed in full or in part pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture
described above before the Notes of any other series are optionally redeemed in full (or at all) pursuant to such optional redemption
provisions of the Indenture.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuers may redeem the Notes, at their option, in whole, but not in part, upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
(but not including) the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date) and all Additional
Amounts (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due or that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuers determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, regulations,
protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a government agency or court of competent jurisdiction)
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), and

(3) any Payor (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”), with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee is, or on the next date on
which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to such Payor (including the appointment of a
new paying agent or, where such action would be reasonable, payment through another Payor); provided that no Payor
shall be required to take any measures that in the Issuers’ good-faith determination would result in the imposition on
such person of any material legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence by such person of additional material costs, or
would otherwise result in any material adverse consequences to such person.

In the case of any Payor, the Change in Tax Law with respect to a given Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction must become effective on
or after the later of the date of the Existing Notes Offering Memorandum or the date a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest
date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts.

Prior to the publication, mailing or delivery of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuers will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that they are entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to their right so to redeem have been satisfied (including
that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Payor taking reasonable measures available to it)
and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor would be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept and shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in which any successor to
a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor or any successor in interest to any of the foregoing (each, a
“Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for Taxes unless such
withholding or deduction is required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by
or on behalf of:

127


-----

(1) any jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax) from or through which payment on the Notes or any Guarantee is made by such Payor, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax) in which a Payor that actually makes a payment on the Notes or its Guarantee is incorporated
or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required from any payments made with respect
to the Notes or any Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by the noteholders after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts that would have been received in respect of such
payments on the Notes or the Guarantees in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_ _however, that no such_
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant noteholder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant noteholder or beneficial owner, if such noteholder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Notes or the receipt of any payment or
exercise of any right in respect thereof;

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied if the holder or beneficial owner of the Note had, to the extent
legally entitled to do so, complied with a reasonable request in writing of the Payor (such request being made at least 30
days prior to the application of this clause) to make a declaration of nonresidence or any other claim or filing or satisfy
any certification, identification, information or reporting requirement for exemption from, or reduction in the rate of,
withholding to which it is entitled (provided that such declaration of nonresidence or other claim, filing or requirement is
required by the applicable law, treaty, regulation or official administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as
a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a part of any such Taxes);

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of the Existing Notes Offering
Memorandum (or any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous
to comply with), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant
thereto, and any intergovernmental agreements implementing the foregoing (including any legislation or other official
guidance relating to such intergovernmental agreements); or

(6) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding
if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days after the
relevant payment was first made available for payment to the holder (provided that notice of such payment is given to the holders)
or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the holder of the Note, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled
to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) through (6) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each relevant taxing authority imposing such Taxes and will
provide such certified copies to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Payor to obtain such

128


-----

receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Payor will provide the Trustee with other evidence reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee. Such receipts or other evidence will be made available by the Trustee to holders on written request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on the Notes, at least 30 days
prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact
that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor shall deliver such Officer’s Certificate and such other
information as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date, but no less than five Business Days
prior thereto). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee or this “Description of the Dollar Notes” there is mention of, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee;

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in
such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that
arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale, registration or enforcement of any
Notes, the Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Notes), other than any
such Taxes payable due to a registration, submission or filing by a party of any Notes, the Indenture or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto where such registration, submission or filing is or was not required to maintain or preserve the rights
of the party under such documents. The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the
Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized,
engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuers are not, and will not be, required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the
Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

In the case of any partial redemption of any series of Notes, selection of the Notes of such series for redemption will be made by
the applicable Paying Agent in compliance with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes are listed
(so long as such Paying Agent knows of such listing), or if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other
method as such Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements
and the procedures of The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”)) in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples
of $1,000 in excess thereof; provided that the selection of Notes of any series for redemption shall not result in a holder of Notes
with a principal amount of Notes less than the applicable minimum denomination. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in
part only, the notice of purchase or redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has
been or is to be purchased or redeemed. Subject to the terms and procedures set forth under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” a
new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called
for redemption so long as the Issuers have deposited with the applicable Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of and
premium, if any, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes to be redeemed. The Paying Agent and the Trustee shall
have no liability with respect to payments or disbursements to be made by the Paying Agent and Trustee (i) for which payment
instructions are not made or that are not otherwise deposited by the respective times required and (ii) shall not be obligated to

129


-----

make payment until they have confirmed receipt of funds sufficient to make the relevant payment. Neither the Trustee nor any
Agent shall be required to pay out any money without first having been placed in funds.

Notices of redemption will be delivered at least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes
to be redeemed at its registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, except that redemption notices
may be delivered more than 60 days prior to the redemption date if (a) the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the
Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or (b) in the case of a redemption that is subject to one or more conditions
precedent, the date of redemption is extended as permitted in the Indenture.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Existing Notes Issue Date, each holder will have the right to require the
Issuers to purchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal
to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject
to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling
prior to or on the purchase date), except to the extent the Issuers have previously elected to redeem all of the Notes as described
under “—Optional Redemption.”

Prior to or within 60 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuers have exercised their right to redeem
all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers shall deliver a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each
holder with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred or, if the Change of Control Offer is being made in advance of a Change of
Control, that a Change of Control is expected to occur, and that such holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the
right to require the Issuers to purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right
of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
purchase date);

(2) the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, such Change of Control;

(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days (unless delivered in advance of the
occurrence of such Change of Control) from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(4) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(5) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender
such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the
paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(7) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such
Notes; _provided_ that the paying agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of
Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have
such Notes purchased;

(8) that if a holder (other than a holder of a global note) is tendering for purchase less than all of its Notes, the Issuers will
issue new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered and the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to $200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
excess thereof (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by DTC);

(9) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is
conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control; and

130


-----

(10) the other instructions determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in order to have
its Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer, a holder of the Notes may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes to be made through the facilities of DTC,
in accordance with the rules and regulations thereof.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of
Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable
to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchase all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer.

Additionally, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if the Issuers have previously issued a notice of a
full redemption pursuant to the provisions set forth under the heading “—Optional Redemption.”

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control.

The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuers or portions thereof validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation the Notes so accepted together
with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuers.

The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the
Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including asset sales, equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time
or otherwise affect the Issuers’ capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only_
with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the
Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Existing Credit Facility Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers
become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a
Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent
of their lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that
contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuers will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice
and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers may also contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of
Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. If the Issuers experience a Change of Control
that triggers a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the

131


-----

Existing Credit Facility Agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Existing Credit Facility Agreement,
such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement being declared due and payable.
Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such
senior Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on the Issuers. The
occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation on the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Euro Notes.

The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuers’ then
existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
purchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds
_necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets
of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although
there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require such Issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease
or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group
may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the
_funds necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change
of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any time (including after a Change of
Control) with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Existing Notes Issue
Date, (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default (other than any Default that
would not constitute a Default following a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below)) has occurred and is continuing under
the Indenture (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a
“Covenant Suspension Event”), and (x) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to
the following covenants or provisions (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Dividend and Other payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(7) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(8) “—Future Guarantors”; and

(9) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.”

In the event that, after a Covenant Suspension Date, the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating from two of the Rating
Agencies (the date of such event, the “Reversion Date”), then the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries
will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this
description as the “Suspension Period.” Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds

132


-----

shall be reset at zero. With respect to Restricted Payments made after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments
made will be calculated as though the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” had
been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. No Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
during the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant were in effect during such period. In addition, all_
Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have
been Incurred or issued pursuant to clause (c) of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” In addition, (i) for purposes of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants —Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements entered into by the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of the Issuers during the Suspension Period prior to such
Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph of “—Certain Covenants —
_Transactions with Affiliates,” (ii) for purposes of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Dividend and other payment_
_restrictions affecting Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain_
any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of “—Certain Covenants —Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries,” and (iii) for purposes of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Liens,” any Lien incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion
Date will be deemed to have been entered into pursuant to clause (7) of the definition of Permitted Liens. In addition, any Change
of Control during such Suspension Period shall not require a Change of Control Offer during or after the Suspension Period;
_provided that if the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control occurs during a Suspension Period_
and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by either of the Rating Agencies during the period commencing 90
days prior to such notice until the end of the 90 day period following such notice (which 90 day period shall be extended so long
as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies) then
the Issuers shall be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the Reversion Date.

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or “Permitted Liens” to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Existing Notes_
Issue Date and during the Suspension Period.

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred
as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period and the Issuers and any
Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any of the Suspended Covenants
(notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Indenture, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual
commitments or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby; _provided_ that, to the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the making of a
Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” and if not permitted by any of such
provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” and shall be deducted for purposes of calculating the amount
pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not be less than zero).

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.

One of the Issuers shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event
or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if such events have occurred, (ii)
make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension Period on the Parent Guarantor’s, the Issuers’
and any Restricted Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of any Covenant Suspension
Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Indenture provides that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue any
shares of Disqualified Stock, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to issue
any shares of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary may issue
shares of Preferred Stock, in each case, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor (or Holdings), the Issuers
and the Restricted Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis), as of the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred or such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 (such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or

133

Preferred Stock Incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph, “Ratio Debt”); provided, further, that the outstanding aggregate
principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued
pursuant to the foregoing by non-Guarantor Subsidiaries shall not exceed the greater of (x) $175 million and (y) 50% of Four

any Credit Agreement, the guarantees thereof and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
and ancillary facilities thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal
amount equal to the face amount thereof) up to an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the
sum of: (i) $920.0 million; plus (ii) €790.0 million; plus (iii) $20.0 million; plus (iv) an amount equal to the greater of (x)
$325.0 million and (y) 100% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA; _plus (v) an unlimited amount of additional_
Indebtedness, provided that for purposes of this sub-clause (v), on a Pro Forma Basis, after giving effect to the incurrence
of any such Indebtedness (and, in each case, after giving effect to any acquisition consummated concurrently therewith
and all other appropriate pro forma adjustments), (A) for any such Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a
_pari passu basis with the Notes, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio for such Test Period, in each case on a Pro Forma_
Basis, does not exceed either (i) 5.50 to 1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in
connection with an acquisition or Investment, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of
such Indebtedness; (B) for any such Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a junior basis to the Notes, the
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for such Test Period, in each case on a Pro Forma Basis, does not exceed either (i)
6.50 to 1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in connection with an acquisition or
Investment, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness; and (C)
for any such Indebtedness that is unsecured or subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, (1) the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio for such Test Period, in each case on a Pro Forma Basis, does not exceed either (i) 6.50 to 1.00 or
(ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in connection with an acquisition or Investment, the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or (2) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor (or Holdings), the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries (on a consolidated
basis) is greater than or equal to (i) 2.00 to 1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in
connection with an acquisition or Investment, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of
such Indebtedness;

Notes) and the Guarantees thereof, as applicable;

(c) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries and Preferred
Stock of the Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Existing Notes Issue Date or on any Reversion Date (excluding, in
each case, Indebtedness described in clause (a) or (b) above that is Incurred or existing (or deemed to be Incurred or
existing) on the Existing Notes Issue Date or any Reversion Date);

greater of (x) $150 million and (y) 40% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, at any one time outstanding, plus, in the
case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted under this clause (d) or any
portion thereof, any Refinancing Expenses; _provided_ that Capitalized Lease Obligations Incurred by the Parent

Transaction shall not be subject to the foregoing limitation so long as the proceeds of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction
are used by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary to permanently repay any secured
Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of the Guarantors (it being understood that any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or

134

Preferred Stock Incurred pursuant to this clause shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to this clause
(d) but shall be deemed Incurred and outstanding as Ratio Debt from and after the first date on which the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as Ratio Debt (to the extent the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted
Subsidiary is able to Incur any Liens related thereto as Permitted Liens after such reclassification));

(e) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries constituting
reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit or bank guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary
course of business, including, without limitation, (i) letters of credit or performance or surety bonds in respect of workers’
compensation claims, health, disability or other employee benefits (whether current or former) or property, casualty or

any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock (except to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be
Incurred or issued as Ratio Debt, the Issuers shall, in their sole discretion, at the time of Incurrence or issuance, divide, classify or
reclassify, or at any later time divide, classify or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or
any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that any Indebtedness deemed incurred pursuant to
the second paragraph of this covenant shall automatically cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of this
covenant but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which
such Indebtedness could have been under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on the second paragraph of this
covenant; provided further that all Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Existing Notes
Issue Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred, in the case of the Dollar-denominated term loans, pursuant to clause (a)(i) of
the definition of “Permitted Debt,” in the case of the Euro-denominated term loans borrowed on or prior to the Existing Notes Issue
Date, pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt,” and, in the case of the revolving portion of the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement, pursuant to clause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and the Issuers shall not be permitted to reclassify
all or any portion of the Indebtedness Incurred on or prior to the Existing Notes Issue Date pursuant to clause (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii)
of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization
of original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the
payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock of the same class, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of
property securing Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness
that are otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination
of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of
credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket or any basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated
EBITDA, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the creation or
incurrence or any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Issuers may elect, at their option, to treat all or any portion
of the committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such
committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of
such election date, and, if such ratio-based basket or such basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated
EBITDA, is satisfied with respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant
or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not such ratio-based basket or basket amount calculated by
reference to Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met; provided that for purposes of subsequent calculations of
such ratio, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually
outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or until the Issuers revoke an election of a Reserved Indebtedness
Amount.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary unless the Issuers elect otherwise, if, on any date, the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions (A) Incurs
Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as permitted by a ratio-based basket and (B) Incurs Indebtedness or
issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under a non-ratio-based basket, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such
date with respect to any Incurrence under the applicable ratio-based basket without giving effect for the Incurrence under such
non-ratio-based basket made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance
of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollarequivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt financing to fund an acquisition, or first issued in the case of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing
would cause the applicable Dollar- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, being refinanced (plus any Refinancing Expenses).

The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the
date of such refinancing.

The Indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is
unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with
respect to the same collateral.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Indenture provides that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

the Parent Guarantor or an Issuer payable solely in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent
Guarantor or such Issuer; or (B) dividends or distributions by a Restricted Subsidiary so long as, in the case of any
dividend or distribution payable on or in respect of any class or series of securities issued by a Restricted Subsidiary
other than a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary receives
at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution in accordance with its Equity Interests in such class or series of
securities);

(2) purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any Equity Interests of the Parent Guarantor or any

acquisition or retirement of Subordinated Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor
in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal installment or final maturity, in each case due within one
year of the date of such payment, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement); or

(4) make any Restricted Investment;

Event of Default pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2) or (5) of “—Defaults” shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof.

As of the New Notes Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will be Restricted Subsidiaries. None of the Issuers
will permit any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary, or any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted
Subsidiary, except pursuant to the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary
as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries
(except to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments
in an amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted
if a Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries are not subject to any of the restrictive covenants set
forth in the Indenture.

For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) would be permitted
pursuant to one or more provisions described above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” the Issuers may divide and classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant and may later divide and reclassify any such Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof)
between one or more provisions described above and/or one or more clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments”
in any manner that complies with this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, any Restricted Payment permitted under this covenant
may be made in the form of a loan.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness
or Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers, Holdings, any direct or indirect parent of Holdings or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any direct or indirect parent of Holdings and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Indenture provides that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit

effect on the Existing Notes Issue Date, including pursuant to the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the other
documents relating to the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, related Swap Contracts and Indebtedness permitted
pursuant to clause (c) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”;

(3) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order;

(4) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by or merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the
Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated a Restricted
Subsidiary that was in existence at the time of such acquisition (or at the time it merges with or into the Parent Guarantor,
any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from such Person (but,
in each case, not created in contemplation thereof)), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person,
or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired or
designated; provided that in connection with a merger, amalgamation or consolidation under this clause (4), if a Person
other than the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is the successor company with respect to
such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, any agreement or instrument of such Person or any Subsidiary of such
Person, shall be deemed acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, at the time of such merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(5) customary encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts or agreements for the sale of assets applicable to such
assets pending consummation of such sale, including customary restrictions with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary

(6) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary
course of business;

are the subject of those agreements;

(8) purchase money obligations for property acquired and Capitalized Lease Obligations entered into in the ordinary course
of business, to the extent such obligations impose restrictions of the type described in clause (c) in the first paragraph of
this covenant on the property so acquired;

(9) customary provisions contained in leases, sub-leases, licenses, sublicenses, contracts and other similar agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business to the extent such obligations impose restrictions of the type described in
clause (c) in the first paragraph of this covenant on the property subject to such lease;

147


-----

(10) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Factoring or Qualified Receivables
Financing that, in the good faith determination of the Issuers, is necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified
Receivables Factoring or Qualified Receivables Financing, as applicable;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction in respect of or contained in other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
of the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that has been, or will be, Incurred subsequent to the
Existing Notes Issue Date pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of
_Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” provided that (i) such encumbrances and_
restrictions in respect of or contained in any agreement or instrument will not materially affect such Issuer’s ability to
make anticipated principal or interest payments on the Notes (as determined by such Issuer in good faith) or (ii) such
encumbrances and restrictions contained in any agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less
favorable to the holders of the Notes than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the Existing
Credit Facility Agreement (as determined by such Issuer in good faith);

(12) any encumbrance or restriction contained in secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and/or “—Liens” to the extent limiting the right of the debtor to dispose of the_
assets securing such Indebtedness;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness,
and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) detract from the value of the property or assets of the Parent
Guarantor, such Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary or (y) materially affect the Issuers’ ability to make future principal or interest payments on the
Notes, in each case, as determined by such Issuer in good faith;

(14) customary provisions in joint venture agreements or arrangements and other similar agreements or arrangements
relating solely to the applicable joint venture; and

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) in the first paragraph of this covenant
imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) through
(14) of this second paragraph of this covenant; provided that such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing are, in the
good faith judgment of such Issuer, not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances and
restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement
or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or
liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction
on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances made to the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any such Restricted
Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Asset Sales_**

any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless:

by way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the
time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor,
such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor, together with all other Asset
Sales since the Existing Notes Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or

that would have been reflected on the Parent Guarantor’s, such Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date
of such balance sheet in the good faith determination of such Issuer) of the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that are
extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale, or that are assumed by the

Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this subclause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of (x) $100 million and (y) 40.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, calculated at the time of
the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes
in value);

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this clause (2).

Within 540 days after the Parent Guarantor’s, the relevant Issuer’s or Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of
any Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the
Applicable Percentage of such Net Cash Proceeds (the “Applicable Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale, at its option:

Indenture or by making an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);
_provided, however, that to the extent the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary have elected to_
purchase any amount of the Notes at a price not less than par, to the extent holders elect not to tender their Notes for
such purchase, the Issuers will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Cash Proceeds equal to such amount not
tendered, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds;

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses, assets (other than working capital assets), or property or capital
expenditures, in each case used or useful in a Similar Business;

149


-----

(4) to make an investment (including capital expenditures) in any one or more businesses, properties (other than working
capital assets) or assets (other than working capital assets) that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that
are the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(5) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the provisions_
described in clause (4) or (5) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 540 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net
Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, has entered into and not
abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment in compliance with the provision described in clauses (4) or
(5) of this paragraph, and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 540-day period. Such 540day period (as may be extended pursuant to this paragraph) shall constitute the “Proceeds Application Period.”

“Applicable Percentage” means 100%; provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or
would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale
and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.75 to 1.00 but equal to or greater than
4.25 to 1.00 or (2) 0% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First
Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.25 to 1.00.

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted
Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net
Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

If, with respect to any Asset Sale, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Sale, there
remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (such
amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA,
“Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Issuers shall make an
offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) no later than ten Business Days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all holders
of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be
purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted
value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as
may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The
Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer at any time prior to the
expiration of the application period.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in
connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall select the applicable Notes
(and the Issuers or their agents shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent that any of or all the Excess Proceeds of any Asset Sales
(x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated or (y) would result in adverse tax consequences, as
determined by the Issuers in their sole discretion, an amount equal to the portion of such Excess Proceeds so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and such amounts may be retained by the applicable selling Subsidiary;
provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required,
such repatriation of any of such affected Excess Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, an amount equal to such
amount of Excess Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any Taxes, costs or expenses that would
be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with
this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the
avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be
construed to require the Issuers or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

150


-----

To the extent the Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms
thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuers need only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant
and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the Issuers’ discretion. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an
Asset Sale may be waived or modified as described in the first sentence of “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Existing Credit Facility Agreement prohibits or limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers
become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the
Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers or one of their Affiliates could seek the consent of their lenders or
investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers or one
of their Affiliates do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuers are required to purchase, selection of such Notes for
purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes
are listed (so long as the Paying Agent knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the total
amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only
Notes in denominations of the minimum denomination of $200,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof shall be
purchased (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by DTC)), by lot or by such other method as the Paying
Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and, in the case of
Global Notes, the procedures of the Depositary); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not result in a holder with
a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of $200,000 (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may
be permitted by DTC). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left
outstanding.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten days but not
more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance
with the procedures of DTC as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee and any Paying Agent). If any Note is to be purchased in
part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or
is to be purchased.

A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note) purchased in part will be
issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuers default
in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Indenture provides that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or series
of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of the
Issuers involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50 million (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless such
Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Parent Guarantor, the relevant
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis (as determined in good faith by the senior
management or the Board of Directors of the relevant Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the relevant Issuer).

The foregoing provisions do not, and will not, apply to the following:

(1) (a) transactions between or among the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and/or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries (or an
entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction) and (b) any merger, amalgamation or
consolidation of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and Holdings or any other direct or indirect parent of the Parent

151


-----

Guarantor or the Issuers; provided that such parent entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets (other
than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers) and such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide
business purpose;

(2) (a) Restricted Payments permitted by the Indenture and (b) Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments
under clause (13) of the definition thereof);

(3) transactions in which the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Parent
Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause
(a) of the preceding paragraph;

(4) payments, loans, advances or guarantees (or cancellation of loans, advances or guarantees) to employees, officers,
directors, managers, consultants or independent contractors for bona fide business purposes or in the ordinary course
of business;

(5) any agreement or arrangement as in effect as of the Existing Notes Issue Date or any Reversion Date or as thereafter
amended, supplemented or replaced (so long as such amendment, supplement or replacement agreement or
arrangement is not materially disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the senior management of such Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers) to the holders of the Notes when taken as a whole as compared to the
original agreement or arrangement as in effect on the Existing Notes Issue Date) or any transaction or payments
contemplated thereby;

(6) the Management Incentive Payments;

(7) the existence of, or the performance by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of any stockholders or similar agreement (including any registration rights agreement or
purchase agreement related thereto) to which it is a party entered into as of the Existing Notes Issue Date or similar
transactions, arrangements or agreements which it may enter into thereafter; provided, however, that the existence of,
or the performance by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under,
any future amendment to any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement or under any similar transaction,
arrangement or agreement entered into after the Existing Notes Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to
the extent that the terms of any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement, together with all amendments
thereto, taken as a whole, or new transaction, arrangement or agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous (as
determined in good faith by the senior management of the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers) to the
holders of the Notes, in any material respect when taken as a whole as compared with the original transaction,
arrangement or agreement as in effect on the Existing Notes Issue Date;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case, in the ordinary
course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, which are fair to the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries or are on terms at least as favorable (as determined in good faith by the
senior management of the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers) as might reasonably have been obtained
at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Receivables Financing or a Qualified Receivables Factoring;

(10) the sale, issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers;

(11) payments by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Investor made for any
financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities,
including, without limitation, in connection with acquisitions or divestitures, which payments are approved by a majority
of the Board of Directors of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor

by any Investor or a direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers in Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock of the Issuers) of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers (and payment of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by any Investor or a direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers in connection
therewith);

(13) any transaction with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely
because the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in or otherwise controls
such Person; provided that no Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the
Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall have a beneficial interest or otherwise participate in such
Person;

(14) transactions between the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that would
constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because such Person is a director, or such Person has a director who is also a

_provided, however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such_
direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other
Person;

**_Limitations on Holding Company Activities_**

Holdings shall not conduct, transact or otherwise engage in any material business or operations except for a Permitted Holding
Company Activity.

**_Liens_**

The Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor
to, directly or indirectly, create or Incur any Lien securing Indebtedness other than Permitted Liens (each, a “Subject Lien”) on
any asset or property of any of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(1) in the case of Subject Liens on any Collateral, such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien; and

(2) in the case of any Subject Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the Notes (or a Guarantee in the case
of Subject Liens on assets or property of a Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in
the case such Subject Lien secures any Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien until
such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by such Subject Lien or (ii) such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien.

Any Lien that is granted to secure the Notes or the applicable Guarantee pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at the same time as the release of the Lien that gave rise to the
obligation to secure the Notes or the Guarantee under the applicable preceding paragraphs (other than a release as a result of the
enforcement of remedies in respect of such Lien or the Obligations secured by such Lien).

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased
**Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of**
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, any fees, underwriting discounts,
accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture provides that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuers will provide to the Trustee and, upon request, to
holders of the Notes a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 120 days (or, 150 days with respect to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021) after the end of each fiscal year
(or such longer period as may be permitted by the SEC if the Parent Guarantor were then subject to SEC reporting
requirements as a non-accelerated filer, including under Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), annual
audited financial statements for such fiscal year including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to the periods presented (and including, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any significant acquisition or disposition consummated within the period, pro forma revenues, net income,
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA pro forma for such acquisition or disposition, unless such
_pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) of this covenant) and a report_
on the annual financial statements by the Parent Guarantor’s independent registered public accounting firm or the foreign
analog thereof (the “Auditor”) (all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent
with the corresponding financial information included in the Existing Notes Offering Memorandum),

(2) within 45 days (or 60 days for the next three fiscal quarters ended after the Existing Notes Issue Date (other than any
fourth fiscal quarter)) after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or such longer period as
may be permitted by the SEC if the Parent Guarantor were then subject to SEC reporting requirements as a nonaccelerated filer, including under Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), unaudited financial
statements for the interim period as of, and for the period ending on, the end of such fiscal quarter including a
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (and including, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any significant acquisition or disposition consummated within the period, pro forma
revenues, net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA pro forma for such acquisition or
disposition, unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (1) or (3) of
this covenant) (all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the
corresponding financial information included in the Existing Notes Offering Memorandum), and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuers announce publicly or any acquisition, disposition or
restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer or director changes at the Parent Guarantor or a change
in auditors of the Parent Guarantor, a report containing a description of such event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) none of the Issuers will be required to furnish any information,
certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items
307 or 308 of Regulation S-K or (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any nongenerally accepted accounting principles financial measures contained therein, (b) the information and reports referred to in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant will not be required to contain the separate financial statements or
other information contemplated by Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (c) to the extent pro forma
financial information is required to be provided by the Issuers, the Issuers may provide only pro forma revenues, net income and
the cumulative effect of accounting changes, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (if applicable), senior
secured debt, total debt and capital expenditures (or equivalent financial information) in lieu thereof, (d) the information and reports
referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be required to present compensation or
beneficial ownership information, (e) the information and reports referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this
covenant shall not be required to include any exhibits required by Item 15 of Form 10-K, Item 6 of Form 10-Q or Item 9.01 of Form
8-K, (f) trade secrets and other proprietary information may be excluded from any disclosures and (g) no required report will be
required to contain any “segment reporting.” If at any time the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of
the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers has made a good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect
to an Equity Offering of such entity’s Capital Stock, the Issuers will still be required to provide reports pursuant to this covenant but
the content of such reports will not be required to disclose any information that, in the good faith view of the Issuers, would violate
the securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or otherwise have an adverse effect on such Equity Offering.

For so long as the Issuers have designated certain of the Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation (which need
not be audited or reviewed by the Auditors), either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, or in the
“Management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” or other comparable section, of the financial

155


-----

position and results of operations of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial position and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuers will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, the
Issuers will furnish to holders of the Notes, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act (or any successor provision).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information, auditors’ reports and other documents required to be provided
as described above, may be, rather than those of the Parent Guarantor, those of (a) any predecessor or successor of the Parent
Guarantor or any entity meeting the requirements of clause (b) or (c) of this paragraph, (b) any Wholly Owned Subsidiary that,
together with their consolidated Subsidiaries, constitutes substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuers and their consolidated Subsidiaries (“Qualified Reporting Subsidiary”) or (c) any direct or indirect parent of the Parent
Guarantor or the Issuers; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or
such direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers, the same is accompanied by consolidating information, which
may be posted to the websites of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or
the Issuers or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers
or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Qualified Reporting
Subsidiary or such parent entity (as the case may be), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating
information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the Auditors.

The Issuers will be deemed to have satisfied the information and reporting requirements of the first paragraph of this covenant if
(a) the Issuers or any Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers has filed reports or registration
statements containing such information (including the information required pursuant to the first sentence of the immediately
preceding paragraph, which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be filed with the SEC via EDGAR to the extent it is otherwise
provided to holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant) with the SEC via the EDGAR (or successor) filing system within the
applicable time periods after giving effect to any extensions permitted by the SEC and that are publicly available or (b) with respect
to the holders of the Notes only, the Issuers or such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or such parent entity has made such reports
available electronically (including by posting to a non-public, password-protected website as provided above) pursuant to this
covenant. The Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether any filings have been made.

So long as Notes are outstanding, the Issuers will use commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) promptly after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant
reporting period; and

(b) announce by press release or post to the websites of the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers or on a
non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers or a third
party, which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment (but not restrict the recipients of such information from trading
securities of the Issuers or their respective affiliates), prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in
accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph, the time and date of such conference call and either all information
necessary to access the call or informing holders of Notes, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes, bona fide market
makers in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis
of an investment in the Notes) how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the applicable password
or other login information;

_provided, however, that the Issuers will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of clause (a) of this paragraph if any direct_
or indirect parent of the Issuers holds a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant
reporting period.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically cured if any Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent of any Issuer, as the case may be, provides all required reports to the noteholders with a copy to
the Trustee or files all required reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system. Delivery of any reports, information and
documents to the Trustee pursuant to this section will be for informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s receipt thereof shall
not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including
the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture. The Trustee does not have a duty to verify the accuracy of
such financial statements and/or reports.

**_Future Guarantors_**

If, on or after the Existing Notes Issue Date, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly formed, newly acquired or newly
redesignated Restricted Subsidiary, but excluding any Receivables Subsidiary, any CFC, any direct or indirect subsidiary of a CFC)
that is not then an Issuer or a Guarantor (x) guarantees or borrows or issues any Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement (or any refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or (y) guarantees any capital markets Indebtedness with an
aggregate principal amount in excess of the greater of (x) $250 million and (y) 75.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA
(“Certain Capital Markets Debt”) or (b) the Issuers otherwise elect to have any Restricted Subsidiary become a Guarantor, then,
in each such case, the Issuers shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture substantially in the form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a
Guarantor under the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions as those
set forth in the Indenture and applicable to the other Guarantors; _provided_ that, in the case of clause (a), such supplemental
indenture shall be executed and delivered to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar within 20 Business Days of the date
that such Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement or such Certain Capital Markets Debt has been guaranteed,
co-borrowed or co-issued by such Restricted Subsidiary.

In the event that any Restricted Subsidiary has not provided a Guarantee in respect of the Notes because such Restricted
Subsidiary is a Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a FSCHO, or a direct or indirect subsidiary of a CFC or FSCHO and on any
subsequent date such Restricted Subsidiary no longer constitutes a Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a FSCHO, or a direct or
indirect subsidiary of a CFC or FSCHO but is an obligor or guarantor with respect to the Existing Credit Facility Agreement or
Certain Capital Markets Debt, then the Issuers shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent and the Registrar within 20 Business Days of such subsequent date a supplemental indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture and applicable to other Guarantors.

Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable jurisdiction and defenses
generally available to guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and similar laws, regulations
and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. This includes limiting
Guarantees to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without
rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law. However, such limitations may
not be effective under local law.

Each Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—
_Guarantees.”_

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Liens shall
under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the holders, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security
Documents for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Liens, (ii) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries
may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise confirm, retake, modify or replace any Security Documents
for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—
_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets,” (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released_
in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission,
defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the
Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case
of clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released
or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuers deliver to the Trustee, either (a) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming

157


-----

the solvency of the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable), after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(b) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
which confirms the solvency of the Issuers or the relevant Person granting such Security Interests, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or
(c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the
Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified
or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Issuers comply with the requirements of this covenant, each of the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
(subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the holders.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture provides that, at the request of any Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuers or the Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”
or clauses (a), (d) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (j), (l), (m), (n), (o), (cc) or (dd) of the second paragraph
of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock” and (y) any refinancing Indebtedness in respect of the Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause_
(x), Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an
“Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement
on substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the holders, taken as a
whole); provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security
Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications
or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that, at the direction of the Issuers and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2)
increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by Holdings, the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the amendment of provisions relating to new Indebtedness, including, but not
limited to, the amendment of the definition of discharge date to include such Indebtedness, the amendment of provisions with
respect to the release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests and the amendment of provisions relating
to Indebtedness that will be secured on a super priority basis on market-standard terms), (3) add a co-issuer or Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including
Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders in any material respect.
The Issuers shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuers may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee
or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also provides that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and
Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance,
acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction
would comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

158


-----

The Indenture also provides that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms
and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into
in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement and irrevocably appointed the Trustee and the Security Agent to act on its behalf to enter
into and comply with such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Intercreditor Agreements described above. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal
business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The Indenture provides that none of the Issuers may merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not such Issuer
is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties or
assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) such Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, merger, amalgamation
or winding-up (if other than such Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made is (or is the foreign analog of) a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the
District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it was constituted
on the Existing Notes Issue Date) (such Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor
**Company”);** _provided that after giving effect to any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, assignment,_
transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition, (x) an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the United States,
any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, shall be or become a co-issuer of the Notes and (y) an entity that
is organized or existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall in each case be or become a co-issuer
of the Notes unless, in the case of this clause (y), not doing so would not result in material adverse tax consequences
for the Holders or the Successor Company and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) the Successor Company (if other than such Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of such Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the
Successor Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the
Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period, either:

(a) such Issuer (or a Successor Company, if applicable) would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness as Ratio Debt; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for such Issuer (or a Successor Company, if applicable) and the Restricted
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) would be greater than or equal to such ratio for such Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by supplemental indenture
confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Guarantor’s Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) such Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture,
and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company; provided, that
in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact. The Trustee shall
be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without liability or independent
verification.

159


-----

The Successor Company (if other than such Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes, and such Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) an Issuer may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to any other Issuer or any Guarantor, (b) an
Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate of such Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing such Issuer in another state of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, the United
Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it was constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date), so
long as the principal amount of Indebtedness of such Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby (unless such
increase is permitted by the Indenture), (c) an Issuer may convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of
organization of such Issuer or the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, (d) an Issuer
may enter into a Permitted Reorganization, (e) an Issuer or any Guarantor may change its name and (f) any Restricted Subsidiary
may merge, amalgamate or consolidate with any Issuer so long as such Issuer is the Successor Company in such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c), if the resulting entity is not organized
or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, a co-issuer of the Notes
remains in existence or is organized or existing under such laws; provided further that, in each case of clauses (a) through (f), after
giving effect to the applicable consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition,
(x) an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia,
shall be or become a co-issuer of the Notes and (y) an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg shall in each case be or become a co-issuer of the Notes unless, in the case of this clause (y), not doing so would
not result in material adverse tax consequences for the Holders or the Successor Company and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Indenture further provides that, subject to certain provisions in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the sale
or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, each Subsidiary Guarantor will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the
Issuers will not permit any such entity to, consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not such entity
is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties
or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless:

(1) (a)such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
merger, amalgamation or winding-up (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability
company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District
of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it was constituted on
the Existing Notes Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided by such surviving
Person under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the
jurisdiction of formation of the predecessor Guarantor (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein
called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations of such
Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other
documents or instruments;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation
of the Successor Guarantor or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having
been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(d) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger,
amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture; or

(2) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is made in compliance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” to the extent applicable on the date of the subject transaction.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such
Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged
from its obligations under the Indenture and any Guarantee.

160


-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Guarantor may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate of the Issuers incorporated
or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such Guarantor in the United States, any state or territory
thereof or the District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it was
constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date), so long as the principal amount of Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Restricted
Subsidiaries is not increased thereby (unless such increase is permitted by the Indenture), (2) a Guarantor may (a) consolidate,
merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to, any Issuer or a Guarantor or (b) dissolve if such Guarantor sells, assigns, transfers, leases,
conveys or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another Person in compliance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” and after giving effect to such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or disposition and prior to such dissolution, has no or a de minimis amount of assets, (3) a Guarantor may convert
into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing
entities, organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States,
any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European
Union (as it was constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided
under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of
formation of such Guarantor prior to such conversion, (4) a Guarantor may change its name and (5) any Restricted Subsidiary
(other than the U.S. Issuer or the Luxembourg Issuer) may merge, amalgamate or consolidate into any Guarantor; provided, in the
case of this clause (5), that the surviving Person (i) is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company or
trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or
territory thereof or the District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it
was constituted on the Existing Notes Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided by such
surviving Person under the laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the
jurisdiction of formation of the predecessor Guarantor or the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Restricted Subsidiary
or Guarantor and (ii) is or becomes a Guarantor upon consummation of such merger, amalgamation or consolidation and (6) any
Guarantor may enter into a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no restriction described under “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or
_Substantially all Assets” limits, or shall limit, the ability of any non-Guarantor Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary to engage in_
any merger, consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all assets.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of an Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by such Issuer instead of
such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall
be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Issuer.

**Defaults**

An Event of Default with respect to the Notes of any series is defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on such series of Notes when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of such series of Notes when due at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required purchase, upon acceleration or otherwise;

(3) the failure by Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after receipt
of written notice referred to below with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to
in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in such series of Notes or the Indenture; provided that in the case of a failure to
comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such
period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has
been given;

(4) (x) the failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay the principal amount of any
Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Issuers or a Restricted
Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or (y) the acceleration of any Indebtedness for borrowed
money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary) by the holders
thereof because of a default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid at final
maturity or accelerated exceeds $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent;

161


-----

(5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuers or a Significant Subsidiary;

(6) failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final and non-appealable judgment or
judgments aggregating in excess of $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts that are covered
by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent insurance companies), which judgment or judgments are not
discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and, in the event
such judgment or judgments are covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or judgments or decree which is not promptly stayed; or

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security
Agent) with respect to any material portion of the Collateral for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security
interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers (or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries) shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each
case) any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms
thereof or of the Indenture), or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies in writing that it has any further
liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination or discharge of
the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture and such Default continues for ten
days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or
involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or
regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clause (3) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series
of Notes until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series notify in writing the
Issuers of the Default and such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of the first paragraph above after receipt
of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer) occurs
and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding
Notes of such series by written notice to the Issuers (and to the Trustee, if given by holders of Notes of such series) may declare
the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest, on all Notes outstanding of such series to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default
relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the
outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of a series may rescind
any such acceleration with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series by written notice to the Trustee
may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes of such series, (i) waive, rescind or cancel any declaration of an existing or past
Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing
Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the Notes of such series (other than such
nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due as a result of such acceleration)) or (ii) or waive compliance with any
provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or the Guarantees if, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such waiver,
rescission or cancellation, as applicable, would not conflict with any judgment or decree. Upon any waiver of a Default or Event of
Default effected pursuant to clause (i) of the previous sentence with respect to any series of Notes, such Default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist with respect to such series of Notes, and any Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

162


-----

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences
thereof will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes of
such series, if prior to 30 days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuers deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating
that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount
of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of
Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have
offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (which
includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel). Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any)
or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of any series unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it in its sole discretion in
respect of any loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel);

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security
and/or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have not given the Trustee a written
direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture and, if applicable, any Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of a majority
in principal amount of outstanding Notes of any series are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to
such series of Notes. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel) that may be
caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate regarding
compliance with the Indenture. Upon any Officer of any of the Issuers becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the
Issuers also are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or Event of
Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period), an Officer’s Certificate
specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes); _provided_ that (x) if any such amendment or
supplement will only affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then only
the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required
and (y) if any such amendment or supplement by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner that is different from and
materially adverse relative to the manner in which such amendment or supplement affects other series of Notes, then the consent
of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents

163


-----

obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required. With
respect to any series of Notes, (i) any Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes or (ii) compliance with any
provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or the Guarantees may, in each case, be waived as provided in the fifth
paragraph under “—Defaults.” However, without the consent of holders holding not less than 90% of any series of Notes, then
outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may (with respect to any Notes of such series held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series whose holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note of such series;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note of such series;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes of such
series, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes of such series with respect to a nonpayment default by the holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration;

(5) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note of such series or change the time at which any Note of
such series may be redeemed as described under “—Optional Redemption” (other than, in each case, any change to
the notice periods with respect to such redemptions) or “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(6) make any Note of such series payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(7) impair the right of any holder of Notes of such series to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with
respect to such holder’s Notes;

(8) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or Events of Default or the rights
of holders of Notes of such series to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes of such
series;

(9) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable
Security Documents;

(10) make the Notes of such series or any Guarantee subordinated in right of payment to any other obligations; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions of the Indenture that require the holders’ consent as described
in clauses (1) through (10) of this sentence.

A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuers or any Affiliate of such Issuer holds the Note; provided that in
determining whether the holders of the requisite majority of outstanding Notes, or the outstanding Notes of any series, have
given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Notes of such series owned by the
Issuers or any Affiliate of such Issuer shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding if such ownership is known by a
Trust Officer.

Without the consent of any holder of Notes of any series, the Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture
to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency identified in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee,

(2) to conform the text of the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which
Additional Notes are issued), the Guarantees or the Notes of such series to this “Description of the Notes” or, with respect
to any Additional Notes and any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Additional Notes are
issued, to the “Description of the Notes” relating to the issuance of such Additional Notes solely to the extent that such

164


-----

“Description of the Notes” provides for terms of such Additional Notes that differ from the terms of the initial Notes, as
contemplated by “—General” above,

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of assets,

(4) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of an Issuer or any Guarantor under any Notes
Document,

(5) to provide for uncertificated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Notes of such series; provided
that the uncertificated Notes of such series are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code,

(6) (A) to add or release Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Indenture with respect to the Notes of such series
or (B) to add additional co-Issuer of the Notes of such series to the extent it does not result in adverse tax consequences
to the holders,

(7) to secure the Notes of such series,

(8) to add to the covenants of the Issuers for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuers or any Guarantor,

(9) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect upon delivery to the
Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate certifying the absence of such adverse effect,

(10) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of the Notes of such
series as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and administration of the
Notes of such series; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes
of such series being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes of such series,

(11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee; provided that the successor Trustee
is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture,

(12) to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture,

(13) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security
Documents, or

(14) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the
Security Agent for the benefit of the holders or parties to the Existing Credit Facility, in any property which is required by
the Security Documents or the Existing Credit Facility (as in effect on the Existing Notes Issue Date) to be mortgaged,
pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent
necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such
security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with,
or

(15) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is
sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or
deletion of “—Change of Control” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or
affect any rights of holders of the Notes of any series to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the
Notes of such series, and will, for the avoidance of doubt, require the vote of holders described in the first sentence of this “—
_Amendments and Waivers.”_

**No Personal Liability of Managers, Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or holder of any equity interests in any of the Issuers, any
Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers or any
Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and
it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A noteholder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and
the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and the
Issuers may require a noteholder to pay any Taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. None of the Issuer nor the
Registrar will be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption (except in the case of a Note to be redeemed
in part, the portion of such Note not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection
of Notes to be redeemed or tendered and not withdrawn or in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.
The Notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all
purposes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect and any collateral then securing the Notes of a series shall
be released (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes of a series when:

(1) either (a) all the Notes of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes of
such series which have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to the Issuers or discharged from
such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation or (b) all of the Notes of such
series not previously delivered to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption or are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, for the giving of notice of a full redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such entity designated (as
agent) by the Trustee or the Issuers for such purpose) in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers or any Guarantor
have deposited or caused to be deposited in a manner that is not revocable by the Issuers or any of their Affiliates with
the Paying Agent money or U.S. Government Obligations in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for
cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of such series to the date of maturity or
redemption, as the case may be, together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuers directing the Trustee and the
Paying Agent to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(2) the Issuers and/or the Guarantors have paid all other sums then due and payable under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions
precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers at any time may terminate all their obligations under the Notes of any series and the Indenture and have each
Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then-existing Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below) and obligations to register the
transfer or exchange of the Notes of such series and certain rights of the Trustee, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes of such series and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes of such series. The Issuers at any time
may terminate their obligations and those of each Guarantor under certain covenants that are described in the Indenture, including
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions
with respect to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the U.S. Issuer), the judgment default provision described under “—Defaults”

166


-----

and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale
_of all or Substantially all Assets” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (6) of the first paragraph and clause (1)(d) of the third paragraph_
thereof) (“covenant defeasance”). If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option or their covenant defeasance option, each
Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee.

The Issuers may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior exercise of their covenant defeasance option.
If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes of such series may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuers exercise their covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes of such
series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (with respect to any Default by the Issuers or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any of their obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”), (4),
(5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries other than the U.S. Issuer), (6) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries other
than the U.S. Issuer) or (7) under “—Defaults.”

In order to exercise either defeasance option with respect to any series of Notes, the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to
be deposited (the “defeasance trust”) with the applicable Paying Agent (or such entity designated as agent by the Issuers and
acceptable to the Trustee (acting reasonably), acting for the Trustee for this purpose) U.S dollars or U.S. Government Obligations
(in each case in an amount sufficient in the opinion of an internationally recognized certified public accounting firm) for the payment
of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the applicable series of Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be; provided
that if such redemption is made pursuant to the provisions described in the second paragraph under “—Optional Redemption,”
then: (x) the amount of Dollars or U.S. Government Obligations that the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited
will be determined using an assumed Applicable Premium calculated as of the date of such deposit, as calculated by the Issuers
in good faith, and (y) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited additional cash in Dollars in trust on the
redemption date as necessary to pay the Applicable Premium as determined on such date; provided, further, that the Issuers must
comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the
Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such
Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law
after the Existing Notes Issue Date). In each case the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all
conditions precedent provided for or relating to the applicable defeasance has been complied with.

**Measuring Compliance**

With respect to any (x) Investment or acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction that has been definitively agreed to
or publicly announced and (y) repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with
respect to which a notice of repayment (or similar notice), which may be conditional, has been delivered, in each case for purposes
of determining:

(1) whether any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is being Incurred
in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is permitted to be Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;_

(2) whether any Lien being Incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or to secure any such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
in accordance with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Liens” or the definition of “Permitted
Liens”;

(3) whether any other transaction or action undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such Investment,
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (including any Restricted Payments, dispositions, or designations of Restricted
Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries) complies with the covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the
Notes;

(4) any calculation of the ratios, baskets or financial metrics, including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, First Lien Net Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Cash Interest

167


-----

Expense and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings and baskets determined by reference to Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets and, whether a Default or Event
of Default exists in connection with the foregoing; and

(5) whether any condition precedent to the Incurrence of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified
Stock, Preferred Stock, Liens, in each case that is being Incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or
repayment repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is satisfied,

at the option of the Issuers, the date that the definitive agreement for, or public announcement of, such Investment, acquisition or
repayment, repurchase or refinancing or Incurrence of Indebtedness is entered into or the date of any notice, which may be
conditional, of such repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is given to the holders of such Indebtedness (the
“Transaction Commitment Date”) may be used as the applicable date of determination, as the case may be, in each case with
such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition
of “Pro Forma Basis” or “Consolidated EBITDA.” For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuers elect to use the Transaction Commitment
Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, (a) any fluctuation or change in the (i) Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense
and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings of the Issuers and (ii) the applicable exchange rate utilized in calculating compliance with any
dollar-based provision of the Indenture, from the Transaction Commitment Date to the date of consummation of such Investment,
acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, will not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase
or refinancing of Indebtedness, or in connection with compliance by the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any other
provision of the Indenture or the Notes or any other transaction undertaken in connection with such Investment, acquisition or
repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, is permitted to be Incurred and (b) until such Investment, acquisition or
repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is consummated or such definitive agreements are terminated, such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness and all transactions proposed to be undertaken
in connection therewith (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens) will be given _pro forma effect when determining_
compliance of other transactions (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens unrelated to such Investment, acquisition or
repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness) that are consummated after the Transaction Commitment Date and on or
prior to the date of consummation of such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness and
any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) will be deemed to have occurred
on the date the definitive agreements are entered into or public announcement is made and deemed to be outstanding thereafter
for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the date of
consummation of such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness. In addition, the Indenture
will provide that compliance with any requirement relating to the absence of a Default or Event of Default may be determined as of
the Transaction Commitment Date and not as of any later date as would otherwise be required under the Indenture.

For purposes hereof, the “maximum fixed repurchase price” of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that does not have a fixed
repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock were purchased on any date on which maximum fixed repurchase price shall be required to
be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, such fair market value shall be determined reasonably and in good faith by the Issuers.

To the extent the date of any delivery of any document required to be delivered pursuant to any provision of the Indenture falls on
a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable date of delivery shall be deemed to be the next succeeding Business Day.

For purposes of determining the maturity date of any Indebtedness, customary bridge loans that are subject to customary conditions
(including no payment or bankruptcy event of default) that would either automatically be extended as, converted into or required
to be exchanged for permanent refinancing shall be deemed to have the maturity date as so extended, converted or exchanged.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing; notices personally delivered will be deemed given at
the time delivered by hand; notices given by facsimile or email will be deemed given when receipt is acknowledged; and notices
given by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery will be deemed given the next Business Day after timely delivery to
the courier and notices given to DTC shall be sufficiently given if given according to the applicable procedures of DTC. For so long

168


-----

as any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to holders of the Notes may be delivered to DTC, which will give such
notices to the holders of book-entry interests.

**Concerning the Trustee, Security Agent and Agents**

Lucid Trustee Services Limited is the Trustee and Security Agent under the Indenture. We have appointed The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch, to act as Paying Agent and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch as registrar and transfer
agent.

The Indenture contains certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor of the Issuers, to
obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or
otherwise. The Trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate
such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign.

The Indenture provides that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct the
time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain
exceptions. The Indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of
the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. The
Indenture provides that during the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written notice
(which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent person
in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such holder shall have offered to
the Trustee and, if requested, provided the Trustee with security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any
loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel).

The Trustee, the Security Agent and Agents are, and will be, permitted to engage in transactions with the Issuers and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. The Indenture also contains
provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, claim, liability, Taxes and expenses incurred without gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture provides that it, the Existing Notes (including the consent to jurisdiction and service) and the Guarantees with respect
to the Existing Notes are, and that the New Notes and the Guarantees with respect to the New Notes will be, governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the application of the provisions of
articles 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies, dated 10 August 1915, as amended, is
excluded.

**Maintenance of Listing**

The Existing Notes are listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange. After the New Notes Issue Date, the Issuers
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the New Notes to be listed on the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange, and to maintain such listing and the listing of the Existing Notes so long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if
(x) the Issuers are unable to list the New Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange, (y) maintenance of the
listing of the Notes becomes unduly onerous, as reasonably determined by the Issuers or (z) the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange requires additional financial information from Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries than is required pursuant to “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” then the Issuers will, prior to the
delisting of the Notes from the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (if then listed on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange), use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on another internationally
recognized stock exchange (in which case, references in this covenant to the Official List of The International Stock Exchange will
be deemed to be refer to such other stock exchange) that would not cause the Issuers or any of the Subsidiaries to become subject
to Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse (the “Market Abuse Regulation”) and any applicable delegated regulations
thereunder or to become subject to the Market Abuse Regulation as it forms part of the retained European Union law in the United
Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; provided, further, that if the Official List of The International Stock
Exchange or any such other stock exchange requires Holdings, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers to publicly file or make available

169


-----

its financial statements or requires publication of any financial information from Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries, then the Issuers shall not be required to maintain any listing on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange or such other exchange.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Because most of the assets of the Issuers and Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United
States against the Issuers or certain Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any,
interest, redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectible within the United States. See
“Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes (including the consent
to jurisdiction and service) and the Guarantees, the Issuers and each Guarantor that is organized under laws other than the United
States or a state thereof has in the Indenture (1) irrevocably submitted to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, United States, (2) consented that any such action or proceeding

**Currency Indemnity**

The Dollar is the sole currency (the “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuers or any
Guarantor under or in connection with the Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees, including damages. Any amount with respect
to the Notes, Indenture or Guarantees received or recovered in a currency other than the Required Currency, whether as a result
of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuers or any
Guarantor or otherwise by any noteholder or by the Trustee or Paying Agent, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from
the Issuers or any Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuers or any Guarantor to the extent of the Required Currency
amount that the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that Required Currency amount is less than the Required Currency amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
or Paying Agent under the Notes, the Issuers and each Guarantor will indemnify such recipient and/or the Trustee or Paying Agent
against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Issuers and each Guarantor will indemnify the recipient against the
cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein, for, such recipient (with respect to itself), the holder of a Note (with respect to itself) or the Trustee (with
respect to itself) or Paying Agent to certify in a manner satisfactory to the Issuers (indicating the sources of information used) the
loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’
and each Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any such recipient, such holder of a Note or the Trustee or Paying Agent (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee. For the purposes of determining the amount in a currency other than
the Required Currency, such amount shall be determined using the Exchange Rate then in effect.

“Exchange Rate” means, on any day, the rate at which the currency other than the Required Currency may be exchanged into
the Required Currency at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date on the Bloomberg Key Cross Currency
Rates Page for the relevant currency. In the event that such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Key Cross Currency Rate
Page, the Exchange Rate shall be determined by the Issuers in good faith.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE EURO NOTES**

**General**

In this description, (1) the terms “we,” “us” and “our” each refer to Acuris Finance US, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “U.S.
Issuer”), and Acuris Finance S.à r.l., a private limited liability company (société à responsabilité limitée) incorporated and existing
under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, having its registered office at 63-65 rue de Merl, L-2146 Luxembourg, Grand
Duchy of Luxembourg and registered with the Luxembourg Trade and Companies Register under number B 234.205 (the
“Luxembourg Issuer”), (2) the term “Issuer” or “Issuers” in this description refers to the U.S. Issuer and the Luxembourg Issuer
(either individually or collectively, as co-issuers of the Notes, as applicable), (3) the term “Parent Guarantor” means I-Logic
Technologies Bidco Limited, (4) the term “Group” refers to the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries, (5) the term “Holdings” means
I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, (6) unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Subsidiary” (including references to “our
Subsidiary”) shall refer to any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor, and (7) unless the context otherwise requires, the term
“Restricted Subsidiary” shall refer to any Restricted Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor.

For purposes of this description, the € aggregate principal amount of % Senior Secured
Notes due 2030 are referred to as the “Notes.” The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the “Indenture”), to be dated on
or around the Issue Date, among, inter alios, the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor, the Guarantors and Lucid Trustee Services Limited,
as trustee (the “Trustee”) and security agent (the “Security Agent”). Copies of the Indenture may be obtained from the Issuers upon
request after the Issue Date. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of
the Securities Act, and the Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to, and will not incorporate (by reference or otherwise),
any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”). Application will be made to list the Notes on the
Official List of The International Stock Exchange. There can be no assurance that this application will be accepted.

The following summary of certain provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and the Security Documents does not
purport to be complete and is subject to, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, all the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes
and the Security Documents. Capitalized terms used in this “Description of the Euro Notes” section and not otherwise defined
have the meanings set forth in the section “—Certain Definitions.” The Indenture, the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

On the Issue Date, the U.S. Issuer and the Luxembourg Issuer will issue the Notes in an aggregate principal amount of €
million. The Issuers may, from time to time after this offering, issue additional Notes under the Indenture
(“Additional Notes”) without notice to or the consent of holders of any Notes. Any offering of Additional Notes would be subject to
the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock.” The Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Additional Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture_
will vote as a single class (except as otherwise described under “—Amendments and Waivers”). The Indenture will permit the
Issuers to designate the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to each series of Additional
Notes, which may differ from the maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions applicable to the Notes issued on
the Issue Date.

Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this “Description of the Euro Notes,” references to
“Notes” shall be deemed to include the Notes issued on the Issue Date as well as any Additional Notes that are actually issued.
Additional Notes that have the same maturity date, interest rate and optional redemption provisions as the Notes issued on the
Issue Date will be treated as the same series as the Notes issued on the Issue Date unless otherwise designated by the Issuers;
provided that, a separate CUSIP or ISIN will be issued for any Additional Notes unless the New Notes and such Additional Notes
are treated as “fungible” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuers will be entitled to vary the application of certain other
provisions to any series of Additional Notes.

If a holder of Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the Issuers or the applicable Paying Agent, such Paying Agent will
distribute the payments received of principal of, and, if applicable, interest and premium, if any, on that holder’s Notes in accordance
with those instructions. Distribution of all other payments on the Notes will be made at the office or agency of the applicable Paying
Agent unless the Issuers elect to make interest payments through such Paying Agent by check mailed to the holders of Notes at
their addresses set forth in the register of holders; provided that all payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect
to the Notes represented by one or more global notes registered in the name of or held by the common depositary of Euroclear
and Clearstream or their nominee will be made (x) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the
holder or holders thereof or (y) otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders will have rights under
the Indenture.

211


-----

The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form, without coupons, in minimum denominations of €100,000 and any integral
multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Indenture and the Guarantees thereunder will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are important to understanding the relative
ranking of indebtedness and security, the ability to make payments in respect of the indebtedness, procedures for undertaking
enforcement action, subordination of certain indebtedness, turnover obligations, release of security and guarantees, and the
payment waterfall for amounts received by the Security Agent. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” for a description of certain terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The Security Documents referred to below under the caption “—Certain Definitions—Collateral” summarize the terms of the
Collateral that will secure the Notes.

The net proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuers as set forth in this Offering
Memorandum under “Use of Proceeds.”

**Ranking**

The Notes will be joint and several, senior obligations of the Issuers, secured as set forth under “—Security” and will:

� rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is not subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes (including Indebtedness under the Dollar Notes, the Existing Credit Facility Agreement);

� rank senior in right of payment to future Indebtedness of the Issuers that is expressly subordinated in right of payment
to the Notes, if any;

� be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Subsidiaries that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Notes, to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness; and

� be structurally subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness and other liabilities of all non-Guarantor Subsidiaries.

As of September 30, 2021, on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Offering, we would have had $2,312 million in
total debt, all of which would have been secured on Collateral. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—
_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could adversely affect our financial position, our ability to operate our_
_business, react to changes in the economy or our industry, prevent us from fulfilling our obligations with respect to the Notes and_
_the Notes Guarantees, pay our other debts and could divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments,” “Description of_
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Existing Credit Facility Agreement” and “Description of the Dollar Notes.”_

Substantially all of the operations of Holdings, the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers are conducted through their Subsidiaries. As
a result, we are dependent upon dividends and other payments from the Subsidiaries of Holdings to generate the funds necessary
to meet our outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends and other payments may be restricted by law or the
instruments governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Dollar Indenture and the Existing Credit Facility Agreement
or other agreements of such Subsidiaries. Holdings’ Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable the
Issuers to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes. Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor,
claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuers,
including holders of the Notes. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade
creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the
amount of additional Indebtedness that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, and Preferred
Stock that the non-Guarantor Subsidiaries may issue, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions.

Each Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a general, senior obligation of such Guarantor secured as forth under “—Security” and will:

� rank pari passu in right of payment with all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is not subordinated
in right of payment to the applicable Guarantee (including its guarantee of the Indebtedness under the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement and the Dollar Notes);

� be effectively subordinated to all existing and future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is secured by property or assets
that do not secure the Guarantee to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

212


-----

� be structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of any of such Guarantor’s nonGuarantor Subsidiaries; and

� rank senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of such Guarantor that is subordinated in right of payment to
applicable Guarantee.

Each Guarantee will be limited in amount as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable jurisdiction and
defenses generally available to guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent
transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and similar laws,
regulations and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. See “Certain
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.” This includes limiting Guarantees to an_
amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Indenture
or the Guarantees, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent
transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.

However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—Each Notes Guarantee_
_and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
_defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

**Guarantees**

On or around the Issue Date, the Notes will (subject to the Agreed Security Principles) be guaranteed on a senior basis by Holdings
and the Parent Guarantor as well as guaranteed jointly and severally on a senior basis by each of the Restricted Subsidiaries that
also guarantee the Obligations under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. Each Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and,
subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall:

(2) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the guaranteed obligations;

(3) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

(4) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors, transferees and assigns.

A Guarantee of Holdings or the Parent Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(a) upon the Issuers’ exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance,” or if the Indenture is discharged (including through redemption or repurchase of all the Notes
as a result of satisfaction and discharge or otherwise) as described in “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(b) in relation to the Guarantee of the Parent Guarantor, in accordance with an enforcement sale in compliance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(c) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

A Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged:

(a) upon the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation or dissolution)
of (x) the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor, if after such transaction the Subsidiary Guarantor is no
longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (y) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor if such
sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation or dissolution) is made
in compliance with the Indenture so long as such Subsidiary Guarantor is also released from its guarantee of
the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and Certain Capital Markets Debt (if applicable);

(b) upon the Issuers designating such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments” and the definition of
“Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

213


-----

(c) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant
to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors,” (x) the release or discharge of
the guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary (or the co-issuer or co-borrower obligation of such Restricted
Subsidiary) of Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary or (y) the
repayment of the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted in the obligation to guarantee
the Notes (except if a release, discharge or repayment is by or as a result of payment in connection with the
enforcement of remedies under such other guarantee of Indebtedness) unless, in each case of clauses (x) and
(y), at the time of such release, discharge or repayment, such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in
respect of any other Indebtedness that would require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantors”;

(d) upon the Issuers’ exercise of their legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under
“—Defeasance,” or if the Indenture is discharged (including through redemption or repurchase of all the Notes
as a result of satisfaction and discharge or otherwise) as described in “—Satisfaction and discharge”;

(e) in accordance with an enforcement sale in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, or as otherwise provided for under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement.;

(f) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(g) the release or discharge of the guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Guarantor of the Obligations under
the Existing Credit Facility Agreement (except a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection
with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation) unless at the time of such release
or discharge such Guarantor is then a guarantor or an obligor in respect of any other Indebtedness that would
require it to provide a Guarantee pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future
_Guarantors”;_

(h) upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event as described in “—Certain Covenants”; or

(i) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization.

A Guarantee also will be automatically released upon the applicable Subsidiary ceasing to be a Subsidiary as a result of any
foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the Dollar Notes or other exercise
of remedies in respect thereof.

As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, the Guarantors that will guarantee the Notes and the Additional Dollar
Notes and guarantee the Existing Dollar Notes and the Existing Credit Facility Agreement represented 95% of our Pro Forma
Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses), 84% of our revenue and 62% of our
total assets on a pro forma combined basis, excluding consolidation adjustments.

**Terms of the Notes**

The Notes will be joint and several, senior secured obligations of the Issuers. The Notes will mature on February
, 2030. Each Note will bear interest at the rate per annum shown on the front cover of this Offering Memorandum from
, 2022 or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually to
holders of record at the close of business on the or immediately preceding the interest payment date on
and of each year, beginning on the first interest payment date following the Issue Date. Interest will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and in the case of an incomplete month, the number
of days elapsed on the aggregate nominal amount outstanding. Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant
interest payment date.

**Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes**

The Issuers will maintain one or more paying agents for the Notes, including in London (the “Principal Paying Agent” and, together
with any other Paying Agent, the “Paying Agents” and each a “Paying Agent”). The initial Principal Paying Agent for the Notes will

register to enable such Issuers to maintain a register of the Notes at its registered offices. In the event of a conflict between any
register maintained by the Issuers and the register maintained by the Registrar, the register maintained by the Registrar shall
prevail.

Any Issuer may change a paying agent or registrar under the Indenture without prior notice to the holders of the Notes, and the
Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or registrar provided that it segregates
and holds in a separate trust fund for the benefit of the holders of the Notes all money held by it as paying agent.

that are organized in the United States, Luxembourg and England and Wales may in the future be granted to secure obligations
under the Notes, any Guarantee and the Indenture and would also constitute Collateral, in each case other than Excluded Property,

-----

Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of the covenant described below under “—Certain Covenants—Future

and any pledge over property, rights and assets may be limited (or the Liens not perfected), in accordance with the definition of
“Excluded Subsidiaries,” “Excluded Property” and in the case of any Wholly-Owned Subsidiary that is not a Domestic Subsidiary,
the Agreed Security Principles. Pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, a guarantee or security may not be given, or may be
limited. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain terms of the Agreed Security Principles, which include, among
others:

(a) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, capital maintenance, financial assistance, corporate
benefit, fraudulent preference, “interest stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation,” transfer pricing or thin capitalization
rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims and similar principles may prohibit, limit or otherwise restrict the ability of a
member of the “Group” (being comprised of Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries)
to provide a guarantee or security or may require that the guarantee or security be limited by an amount or otherwise;
the relevant Issuer or Guarantor will use commercially reasonable endeavors (not involving the payment of material
amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the parties
benefiting from the Collateral) to assist in demonstrating that adequate corporate benefit accrues to the relevant Issuer
or Guarantor and to overcome any such other limitations to the extent reasonably practicable;

(b) certain supervisory board, works council, regulator or regulatory board (or equivalent), or another external body’s or
person’s consent may be required to enable a member of the Group to provide a guarantee or security. Such guarantee
and/or security shall not be required unless such consent has been received provided that reasonable endeavors (not
involving the payment of material amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) have been used by the relevant member of the Group to obtain the relevant
consent to the extent permissible by law and regulation and such consent has no impact on relationships with third
parties;

(c) the giving of a guarantee or security or the perfection of the security granted will not be required to the extent that it would
incur any legal fees, registration fees, stamp duty, taxes and any other fees or costs directly associated with such
guarantee or security which are not proportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties;

(d) the security and extent of its perfection will be agreed on the basis that the cost to the Group of providing security shall
be proportionate to the benefit accruing to the holders of the Notes;

(e) in certain jurisdictions it may be either impossible or disproportionately costly to grant guarantees or create security over
certain categories of assets in which event such guarantees will not be granted and security will not be taken over such
assets;

(f) any assets subject to third party arrangements which are permitted by the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement and which may prevent those assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security
document; _provided that reasonable endeavors (not involving the payment of material amounts of money or the_
incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) to obtain
consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant Issuer or Guarantor if the relevant asset is material
(regard shall be given, however, to the legitimate interests of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor not to adversely impact
the commercial relationship with such third party);

(g) no member of the Group will be required to give guarantees or enter into security documents to the extent it is not within
the legal capacity of the relevant member of the Group, it results in the security document being null and void or if, in the
reasonable opinion of the directors of the relevant member of the Group, the same would conflict with the fiduciary duties
of their directors or contravene any legal or regulatory prohibition or result in a risk of personal or criminal liability on the
part of any director which, in the case of such conflict, prohibition or risk, cannot be overcome with reasonable endeavors
and at a reasonable cost (in which case, for the avoidance of doubt, appropriate and customary limitation language shall
be added);

(h) subject to the following sentence, perfection of security, when required, and other legal formalities will be completed as
soon as practicable and, in any event, within the time periods specified in the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement therefor or (if earlier or to the extent no such time periods are specified in the Indenture or the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement) within the time periods specified by applicable law in order to ensure due perfection. Prior to the
occurrence of an automatic acceleration or a notice of acceleration under the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility

Agreement, it will not be required to take certain steps of perfecting security (including, without limitation, notification of
receivables security to third party debtors unless otherwise provided in the Agreed Security Principles) if, in the
reasonable opinion of the directors (or equivalent) of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor, it would be unduly burdensome
on or restrict the ability of the relevant Issuer or Guarantor to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course
or as otherwise permitted by the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement;

(i) unless granted under a global security document governed by the law of the jurisdiction of the applicable grantor, all
security (other than share security over its guarantor company subsidiaries) shall be governed by the law of and secure
assets located in the jurisdiction of incorporation of such grantor;

(j) no guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any acquired person or asset (and no consent shall be
required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support debt (not incurred in contemplation of such
acquisition) (“Permitted Acquired Debt”) of such acquired person or encumbering such acquired asset that in each
case is permitted under the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement to remain outstanding; no member of a
target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition permitted under the Indenture or the Existing Credit
Facility Agreement shall be required to become a Guarantor or grant security if prevented by the terms of the
documentation governing that Permitted Acquired Debt or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would
give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; and no security will be granted
over any asset secured for the benefit of any such Permitted Acquired Debt to the extent constituting security otherwise
permitted to subsist under the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement;

(k) the maximum granted or secured amount may be limited to minimize stamp duty, notarization, registration or other
applicable fees, taxes and duties where the benefit of increasing the guaranteed or secured amount is disproportionate
to the level of such fee, taxes and duties;

(l) no perfection action will be required in jurisdictions where Guarantors are not incorporated but perfection action may be
required in the jurisdiction of incorporation of one Guarantor in relation to security granted by another Guarantor
incorporated in a different jurisdiction;

(m) guarantees and security will not be required over the assets of any joint venture (other than in respect of intra-group joint
ventures) if prohibited by a joint venture agreement or similar, provided that commercially reasonable endeavors (not
involving the payment of material amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) to obtain consent to charging any such assets shall be used by the relevant
Guarantor if the relevant asset is material (regard shall be given, however, to the legitimate interests of the relevant
Guarantor not to impact the commercial relationship with any third party);

(n) no security shall be granted over any minority interest in any entity to the extent this is expressly prohibited by a
shareholders’ agreement / joint venture agreement or similar; provided that commercially reasonable endeavors (not
involving the payment of material amounts of money or the incurrence of material expenses which are disproportionate
to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties) to obtain consent to charging any such minority interest shall be used by
the relevant Guarantor if it is material (regard shall be given, however, to the legitimate interests of the relevant Guarantor
not to impact the commercial relationship with any third party);

(o) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection action will be required with respect to assets of
a type not owned by members of the Group;

(p) the Security Agent will hold one set of security for all applicable creditors unless local law requires separate ranking
security for different classes of debt;

(q) no guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations”; and

(r) notwithstanding any term of the Indenture or Existing Credit Facility Agreement, no loan or other obligation under the
Indenture or Existing Credit Facility Agreement may be, directly or indirectly: (i) guaranteed by any Excluded Subsidiary;
(ii) secured by any assets of an Excluded Subsidiary or by Excluded Property; or (iii) guaranteed by any subsidiary or
secured by a pledge of or security interest in any subsidiary or other asset, if it would result in material adverse U.S. tax
consequences as reasonably determined by the Issuers.

217


-----

The Agreed Security Principles also set out certain additional factors which will apply when determining the extent of the guarantees
and the security to be provided and certain additional principles which will be reflected in any security taken.

In the future, the lenders under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and/or counterparties to certain future hedging obligations
and any Additional Notes may also benefit from security which does not secure the Notes offered hereby.

The Liens on the Collateral will be limited as necessary to recognize certain limitations arising under or imposed by local law and
defenses generally available to providers of Collateral (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable
preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose or benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. For a brief description of such limitations,
see “—Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantee and the Collateral” and “Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Notes and our Structure—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.”_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with the Offering of the Notes. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be
sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure— _The value of the_
_Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and the_
_Notes Guarantees”_ and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—It may be difficult to realize the value of the
_Collateral securing the Notes.”_

**Security Documents**

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure, inter alia, the payment when due of the
Issuers’ payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Documents have been entered into among, inter
_alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent._

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture will
be secured by Security Interests in the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged or
the Liens have been released as described under “ –Release of Liens.” The validity and enforceability of the Security Interests are
subject to, _inter alia, the limitations described in “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—Each Notes_
_Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject_
_to certain defenses that may limit its validity and enforceability.” and “Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”_

In the event that Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or the Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar
proceedings, the Security Interests created under the Security Documents or the rights and obligations enumerated in the
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interests or the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement is successful, the holders of the Notes may not be able to recover any amounts under the
Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure.”

**Enforcement of Security Interests**

The Security Documents provide that the rights under the Security Documents must be exercised by the Security Agent. Since
the holders of the Notes will not be a party to the Security Documents, holders will not, individually or collectively, take any direct
action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security Documents. The holders of the Notes may only act through the
Security Agent or the Trustee (as applicable).

To the extent permitted by the applicable laws and subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture, holders
of the Notes will, in certain circumstances, and subject to certain conditions, be entitled to direct the Trustee to provide instructions
to the Security Agent for the enforcement of security over the Collateral. The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement will restrict
the ability of the holders of the Notes, to enforce the Security Interests and provide for the release of the Security Interests created
by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement.
These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain
_Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.” The ability to enforce may also be_
restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

218


-----

The holders of Notes, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have,
and by accepting a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, appointed the Security Agent to act as its agent under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents. The holders
of Notes, the counterparties to certain hedging obligations (if any) secured by the Collateral and the Trustee have, and by accepting
a Note, each holder will be deemed to have, authorized the Security Agent under the Indenture and/or the Intercreditor Agreement
(as applicable) to: (i) perform the duties and exercise the rights, powers and discretions that are specifically given to it under the
Intercreditor Agreement and the security documents securing such Indebtedness, including the Security Documents, together with
any other incidental rights, power and discretions; and (ii) execute each Security Document, waiver, modification, amendment,
confirmation, extension, renewal, replacement or discharge expressed to be executed by the Security Agent in its name and on its
behalf.

**Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuers, the Trustee and the Security Agent will be authorized (without any further consent of
the holders of the Notes) to enter into the Intercreditor Agreement to give effect to the provisions described in the section entitled
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Indenture will also provide that each holder of the Notes, by accepting such Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) appointed and authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements;

(2) authorized the Security Agent and the Trustee, as applicable, to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby and to perform their respective obligations and
exercise their respective rights thereunder in accordance therewith;

(3) agreed to be bound by the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents;

(4) agreed and acknowledged that the Security Agent will administer the Collateral in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Indenture and the Security Documents; and

(5) irrevocably appointed the Security Agent and the Trustee to act in its name and on its behalf to enter into and comply
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—Holders of the Notes may not control certain decisions regarding
_the Collateral” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

Similar provisions to those described above may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (as defined below) entered
into in compliance with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

**Release of Liens**

Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers, the Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of Security
Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral to any Person other than Holdings, the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation
_or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Indenture;

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the release of the
property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Guarantor;

(3) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or defeasance or discharge of the Notes,
as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

219


-----

(5) if the Issuers designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(6) in connection with a Permitted Reorganization;

(7) in the case of a merger, consolidation or other transfer of assets in compliance with the covenant described below under
“—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets”;

(8) in the case of any security interests over intra-group receivables (if any), upon partial repayment or discharge thereof,
the security interests created over such receivables will be automatically reduced in proportion to such partial repayment
or discharge and, upon full repayment or discharge thereof, the security interests shall be automatically and fully released
and of no further effect;

(9) upon the contribution of any claim against the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary, which is
subject to such Security Interests, to the equity of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries;
_provided that, such contribution is made in compliance with the Intercreditor Agreement;_

(10) in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; or

(11) as otherwise not prohibited by the Indenture.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (i) in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and (ii) as would not be prohibited under the covenant described under “—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”_

At the request and expense of the Issuers, the Security Agent and, to the extent reasonably requested, the Trustee (if required)
will take all necessary action required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Notes and the Guarantees, in accordance
with the provisions of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the holders or any
action on the part of the Trustee (unless action is required by it to effect such release). The Security Agent and the Trustee shall
be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as
described above, giving rise to a release of the security interests has occurred, and that such release complies with the Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

On and after, the Issuers may redeem the Notes, at their option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, upon
notice as described under “—Selection and notice,” at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record
on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date),
if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on of the years set forth below:

**Period** **Redemption price for Notes**

2025 ............................................................................................................................... %

2026 ............................................................................................................................... %

2027 and thereafter ........................................................................................................ 100.000%

In addition, at any time prior to, 2025, the Issuers may redeem the Notes at their option, in whole at any
time or in part from time to time, upon notice as described under “—Selection and notice,” at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of the redemption notice, and accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time prior to, 2025, upon notice as described under “—
_Selection and notice,” the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated after giving_

220


-----

effect to any issuance of Additional Notes of such series), with an aggregate amount less than or equal to the cash proceeds less
any underwriting spread paid in cash of one or more Equity Offerings, to the extent (in the case of an Equity Offering by a direct or
indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor) that such cash proceeds thereof are contributed to the common equity capital of the Parent
Guarantor or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor through an issuance of Capital
Stock by the Parent Guarantor, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of the principal amount thereof) equal to %, in
each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption
date); provided, however, that, at least 50% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (excluding any Additional
Notes) must remain outstanding immediately after each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed
in accordance with the terms of the Indenture concurrently with or following the Equity Offering); provided, further, that for purposes
of calculating the principal amount of the Notes able to be redeemed with such cash proceeds of such Equity Offering or Equity
Offerings, such amount shall include only the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed plus the premium on such Notes to
be redeemed; provided, further, that such redemption shall occur within 180 days after the date on which any such Equity Offering
is consummated.

At any time, in connection with any tender offer or other offer to purchase any series of Notes (including pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer or Asset Sale Offer (each as defined below)), if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes of such series are purchased by the Issuers, or any third party purchasing or acquiring such Notes in lieu of the Issuers, the
Issuers or such third party will have the right, upon notice as described under “—Selection and Notice,” given not more than 30
days following such purchase, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price equal
to the price paid to holders in such purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Notes to (but not including) the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date).

Any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuers’ discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent. The redemption date
of any redemption that is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent may, in the Issuers’ discretion, be delayed
until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion), or such redemption
may not occur and any notice with respect to such redemption may be modified or rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuers in their sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by the
redemption date so delayed (which may exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice in such case). In addition, such
notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Issuer by providing
notice to the noteholders.

The Issuers or their affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may be made through
open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more tender or exchange offers or
otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the Issuers or any such affiliates may
determine.

The Notes of any series may be optionally redeemed in full or in part pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the Indenture
described above before the Notes of any other series are optionally redeemed in full (or at all) pursuant to such optional redemption
provisions of the Indenture.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuers may redeem the Notes, at their option, in whole, but not in part, upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
(but not including) the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the redemption date) and all Additional
Amounts (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”), if any, then due or that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a
result of the redemption or otherwise if the Issuers determine in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in official position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, regulations,
protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a government agency or court of competent jurisdiction)
(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), and

221


-----

(3) any Payor (as defined under “—Withholding taxes”), with respect to the Notes or a Guarantee is, or on the next date on
which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to such Payor (including the appointment of a
new paying agent or, where such action would be reasonable, payment through another Payor); provided that no Payor
shall be required to take any measures that in the Issuers’ good-faith determination would result in the imposition on
such person of any material legal or regulatory burden or the incurrence by such person of additional material costs, or
would otherwise result in any material adverse consequences to such person.

In the case of any Payor, the Change in Tax Law with respect to a given Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction must become effective on
or after the later of the date of this Offering Memorandum or the date a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which
the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts.

Prior to the publication, mailing or delivery of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuers will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that they are entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to their right so to redeem have been satisfied (including
that the obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the Payor taking reasonable measures available to it)
and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that the Payor would be obligated to pay
Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee and the Paying Agent will accept and shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent
described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to the laws and official positions of any jurisdiction in which any successor to
a Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein. The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of any Issuer or any Guarantor or any successor in interest to any of the foregoing (each, a
“Payor”) on or with respect to the Notes or any Guarantee will be made without withholding or deduction for Taxes unless such
withholding or deduction is required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by
or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax) from or through which payment on the Notes or any Guarantee is made by such Payor, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction (other than the United States or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax) in which a Payor that actually makes a payment on the Notes or its Guarantee is incorporated
or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clauses (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required from any payments made with respect
to the Notes or any Guarantee, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay
(together with such payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net
amounts received in respect of such payments by the noteholders after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction
or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts that would have been received in respect of such
payments on the Notes or the Guarantees in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_ _however, that no such_
Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied but for the existence of any present or former connection
between the relevant noteholder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over, the relevant noteholder or beneficial owner, if such noteholder or beneficial
owner is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Notes or the receipt of any payment or
exercise of any right in respect thereof;

222


-----

(2) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed or levied if the holder or beneficial owner of the Note had, to the extent
legally entitled to do so, complied with a reasonable request in writing of the Payor (such request being made at least 30
days prior to the application of this clause) to make a declaration of nonresidence or any other claim or filing or satisfy
any certification, identification, information or reporting requirement for exemption from, or reduction in the rate of,
withholding to which it is entitled (provided that such declaration of nonresidence or other claim, filing or requirement is
required by the applicable law, treaty, regulation or official administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as
a precondition to exemption from the requirement to deduct or withhold all or a part of any such Taxes);

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment on the Notes or any Guarantee;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(5) any Taxes payable under Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum (or any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to comply with), any
current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant thereto, and any
intergovernmental agreements implementing the foregoing (including any legislation or other official guidance relating to
such intergovernmental agreements); or

(6) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such deduction or withholding
if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where presentation is required) within 30 days after the
relevant payment was first made available for payment to the holder (provided that notice of such payment is given to the holders)
or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the holder of the Note, such beneficial owner would not have been entitled
to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) through (6) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant
taxing authority in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts
evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each relevant taxing authority imposing such Taxes and will
provide such certified copies to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. If, notwithstanding the efforts of such Payor to obtain such
receipts, the same are not obtainable, such Payor will provide the Trustee with other evidence reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee. Such receipts or other evidence will be made available by the Trustee to holders on written request.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on the Notes, at least 30 days
prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact
that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying
Agent to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor shall deliver such Officer’s Certificate and such other
information as promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date, but no less than five Business Days
prior thereto). The Trustee and the Paying Agent will be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that
such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes, any Guarantee or this “Description of the Notes” there is mention of, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Guarantee;

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the extent that, in
such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary Taxes, or any other excise, property or similar Taxes that
arise in any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, issuance, initial resale, registration or enforcement of any

223


-----

Notes, the Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than a transfer of the Notes), other than any
such Taxes payable due to a registration, submission or filing by a party of any Notes, the Indenture or any other document or
instrument in relation thereto where such registration, submission or filing is or was not required to maintain or preserve the rights
of the party under such documents. The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the
Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized,
engaged in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or
taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Mandatory Redemption**

The Issuers will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

In the case of any partial redemption of any series of Notes, selection of the Notes of such series for redemption will be made by
the applicable Paying Agent in compliance with the requirements of the securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes are listed
(so long as such Paying Agent knows of such listing), or if such Notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other
method as such Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements
and the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream in minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof; provided that the selection of Notes of any series for redemption shall not result in a holder of Notes with a principal
amount of Notes less than the applicable minimum denomination. If any Note is to be purchased or redeemed in part only, the
notice of purchase or redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to
be purchased or redeemed. Subject to the terms and procedures set forth under “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” a new Note in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the
original Note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof called for redemption
so long as the Issuers have deposited with the applicable Paying Agent funds sufficient to pay the principal of and premium, if any,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes to be redeemed. The Paying Agent and the Trustee shall have no liability
with respect to payments or disbursements to be made by the Paying Agent and Trustee (i) for which payment instructions are not
made or that are not otherwise deposited by the respective times required and (ii) shall not be obligated to make payment until
they have confirmed receipt of funds sufficient to make the relevant payment. Neither the Trustee nor any Agent shall be required
to pay out any money without first having been placed in funds.

Notices of redemption will be delivered at least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes
to be redeemed at its registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, except
that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to the redemption date if (a) the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or (b) in the case of a redemption that is subject to
one or more conditions precedent, the date of redemption is extended as permitted in the Indenture.

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Issue Date, each holder will have the right to require the Issuers to purchase
all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase
date), except to the extent the Issuers have previously elected to redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional
_Redemption.”_

Prior to or within 60 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuers have exercised their right to redeem
all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers shall deliver a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each
holder with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred or, if the Change of Control Offer is being made in advance of a Change of
Control, that a Change of Control is expected to occur, and that such holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the
right to require the Issuers to purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right
of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the
purchase date);

224


-----

(2) the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, such Change of Control;

(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days (unless delivered in advance of the
occurrence of such Change of Control) from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(4) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest;

(5) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender
such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the
paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third
Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(7) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such
Notes; _provided_ that the paying agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of
Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have
such Notes purchased;

(8) that if a holder (other than a holder of a global note) is tendering for purchase less than all of its Notes, the Issuers will
issue new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered and the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in
excess thereof (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by Euroclear or Clearstream);

(9) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is
conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control; and

(10) the other instructions determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in order to have
its Notes purchased.

While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control
Offer, a holder of the Notes may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes to be made through the facilities of
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in accordance with the rules and regulations thereof.

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of
Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable
to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchase all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such
Change of Control Offer.

Additionally, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if the Issuers have previously issued a notice of a
full redemption pursuant to the provisions set forth under the heading “—Optional Redemption.”

A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control.

The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law,

(1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuers or portions thereof validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer;

225


-----

(2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and

(3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation the Notes so accepted together
with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and
purchased by the Issuers.

The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the
Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into
certain transactions, including asset sales, equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not
constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time
or otherwise affect the Issuers’ capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are
contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only_
with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations
contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the
Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction.

The Existing Credit Facility Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers
become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a
Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent
of their lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that
contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuers will remain
prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice
and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Existing Credit Facility
Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers may also contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of
Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. If the Issuers experience a Change of Control
that triggers a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the
Existing Credit Facility Agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Existing Credit Facility Agreement,
such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement being declared due and payable.
Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such
senior Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on the Issuers. The
occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation on the Issuers to make an offer to
repurchase the Dollar Notes.

The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuers’ then
existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required
purchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds
_necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets
of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although
there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require such Issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease
or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group
may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the
_funds necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_

The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change
of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any time (including after a Change of
Control) with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding.

**Certain Covenants**

Set forth below are summaries of certain covenants contained in the Indenture. If on any date following the Issue Date, (i) the
Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from two of the Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default (other than any Default that would not

226


-----

constitute a Default following a Covenant Suspension Event (as defined below)) has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture
(the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant
**Suspension Event”), and (x) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the following**
covenants or provisions (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”):

(1) “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;

(2) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Dividend and Other payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Asset Sales”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Impairment of Security Interest”;

(7) the second, third and fourth paragraphs of the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(8) “—Future Guarantors”; and

(9) clause (4) of the first paragraph of “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets.”

In the event that, after a Covenant Suspension Date, the Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating from two of the Rating
Agencies (the date of such event, the “Reversion Date”), then the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries
will thereafter again be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events.

The period of time between the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event and the Reversion Date is referred to in this
description as the “Suspension Period.” Upon the occurrence of a Covenant Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero. With respect to Restricted Payments made after the Reversion Date, the amount of Restricted Payments
made will be calculated as though the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” had
been in effect prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. No Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
during the Suspension Period, unless such designation would have complied with the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” as if such covenant were in effect during such period. In addition, all_
Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have
been Incurred or issued pursuant to clause (c) of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” In addition, (i) for purposes of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants —Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements entered into by the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of the Issuers during the Suspension Period prior to such
Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph of “—Certain Covenants —
_Transactions with Affiliates,” (ii) for purposes of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Dividend and other payment_
_restrictions affecting Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain_
any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second
paragraph of “—Certain Covenants —Dividend and other payment restrictions affecting subsidiaries,” and (iii) for purposes of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Liens,” any Lien incurred during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion
Date will be deemed to have been entered into pursuant to clause (7) of the definition of Permitted Liens. In addition, any Change
of Control during such Suspension Period shall not require a Change of Control Offer during or after the Suspension Period;
_provided that if the public notice of an arrangement that could result in a Change of Control occurs during a Suspension Period_
and the Notes are rated below an Investment Grade Rating by either of the Rating Agencies during the period commencing 90
days prior to such notice until the end of the 90 day period following such notice (which 90 day period shall be extended so long
as the rating of the Notes is under publicly announced consideration for possible downgrade by either of the Rating Agencies) then
the Issuers shall be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon the Reversion Date.

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” or “Permitted Liens” to the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and_
during the Suspension Period.

227


-----

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred
as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period and the Issuers and any
Subsidiary will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any of the Suspended Covenants
(notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Indenture, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual
commitments or obligations entered into during a Suspension Period following a Reversion Date and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby; _provided_ that, to the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the making of a
Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first paragraph or the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” and if not permitted by any of such
provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Restricted Payments” and shall be deducted for purposes of calculating the amount
pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not be less than zero).

There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Rating.

One of the Issuers shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Covenant Suspension Event
or Reversion Date. The Trustee will have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if such events have occurred, (ii)
make any determination regarding the impact of actions taken during the Suspension Period on the Parent Guarantor’s, the Issuers’
and any Restricted Subsidiaries’ future compliance with their covenants or (iii) notify the holders of any Covenant Suspension
Event or Reversion Date.

**_Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock_**

The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not
permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, Incur any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or
issue any shares of Disqualified Stock, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to issue any shares of Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and any Restricted Subsidiary
may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) or issue shares of Disqualified Stock and any Restricted Subsidiary
may issue shares of Preferred Stock, in each case, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor (or Holdings), the
Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis), as of the date on which such additional Indebtedness is Incurred
or such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is issued, is greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 (such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock Incurred or issued pursuant to this paragraph, “Ratio Debt”); _provided,_ _further, that the outstanding_
aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
issued pursuant to the foregoing by non-Guarantor Subsidiaries shall not exceed the greater of (x) $175 million and (y) 50% of

any Credit Agreement, the guarantees thereof and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
and ancillary facilities thereunder (with letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances being deemed to have a principal
amount equal to the face amount thereof) up to an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the
sum of: (i) $920.0 million; plus (ii) €790.0 million; plus (iii) $20.0 million; plus (iv) an amount equal to the greater of (x)
$325.0 million and (y) 100% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA; _plus (v) an unlimited amount of additional_
Indebtedness, provided that for purposes of this sub-clause (v), on a Pro Forma Basis, after giving effect to the incurrence
of any such Indebtedness (and, in each case, after giving effect to any acquisition consummated concurrently therewith
and all other appropriate pro forma adjustments), (A) for any such Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a
_pari passu basis with the Notes, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio for such Test Period, in each case on a Pro Forma_
Basis, does not exceed either (i) 5.50 to 1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in
connection with an acquisition or Investment, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of
such Indebtedness; (B) for any such Indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a junior basis to the Notes, the
Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for such Test Period, in each case on a Pro Forma Basis, does not exceed either (i)
6.50 to 1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in connection with an acquisition or
Investment, the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness; and (C)
for any such Indebtedness that is unsecured or subordinated in right of payment to the Notes, (1) the Consolidated Total
Net Leverage Ratio for such Test Period, in each case on a Pro Forma Basis, does not exceed either (i) 6.50 to 1.00 or
(ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in connection with an acquisition or Investment, the
Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of such Indebtedness or (2) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Parent Guarantor (or Holdings), the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries (on a consolidated

228

basis) is greater than or equal to (i) 2.00 to 1.00 or (ii) if any such request is in relation to Indebtedness to be incurred in
connection with an acquisition or Investment, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio immediately prior to the incurrence of
such Indebtedness;

(b) the Incurrence by the Issuers and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by the Notes (not including any Additional
Notes) and the Guarantees thereof, as applicable;

(c) Indebtedness and Disqualified Stock of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries and Preferred
Stock of the Restricted Subsidiaries existing on the Issue Date or on any Reversion Date (excluding, in each case,
Indebtedness described in clause (a) or (b) above that is Incurred or existing (or deemed to be Incurred or existing) on
the Issue Date or any Reversion Date);

(d) Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Capitalized Lease Obligations and mortgage financings as purchase money

assets or the Capital Stock of any Person owning such assets) and Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
arising from the conversion of the obligations of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary under or
pursuant to any “synthetic lease” transactions to on-balance sheet Indebtedness of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or
such Restricted Subsidiary, in an aggregate principal amount or liquidation preference, including all Indebtedness
Incurred and Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to renew, refund, refinance, replace, defease or discharge any
Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this clause (d), not to exceed the
greater of (x) $150 million and (y) 40% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, at any one time outstanding, plus, in the
case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock permitted under this clause (d) or any
portion thereof, any Refinancing Expenses; _provided_ that Capitalized Lease Obligations Incurred by the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (d) in connection with a Sale/Leaseback
Transaction shall not be subject to the foregoing limitation so long as the proceeds of such Sale/Leaseback Transaction
are used by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary to permanently repay any secured
Indebtedness of the Issuers or any of the Guarantors (it being understood that any Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock Incurred pursuant to this clause shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to this clause
(d) but shall be deemed Incurred and outstanding as Ratio Debt from and after the first date on which the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as Ratio Debt (to the extent the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted
Subsidiary is able to Incur any Liens related thereto as Permitted Liens after such reclassification));

(e) Indebtedness Incurred by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries constituting
reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit or bank guarantees or similar instruments issued in the ordinary
course of business, including, without limitation, (i) letters of credit or performance or surety bonds in respect of workers’

under the Indenture and (y) any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event that results in
any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such
Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock (except to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall

Subsidiary; provided that any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other event that results in any
Restricted Subsidiary that holds such shares of Preferred Stock of another Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a
Restricted Subsidiary or any other subsequent transfer of any such shares of Preferred Stock (except to the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or another Restricted Subsidiary) shall be deemed, in each case, to be an issuance of shares of

shall be deemed Incurred or issued and outstanding as Ratio Debt from and after the first date on which the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness or

as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, Preferred Stock or other obligations by the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or

Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment
of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock
or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class, the accretion of
liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding solely as a
result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant.
Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that are otherwise included in the determination
of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that
the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with
this covenant.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket or any basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated
EBITDA, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the creation or
incurrence or any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Issuers may elect, at their option, to treat all or any portion
of the committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances
thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such
committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of
such election date, and, if such ratio-based basket or such basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated
EBITDA, is satisfied with respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the
issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant
or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not such ratio-based basket or basket amount calculated by
reference to Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or
creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met; provided that for purposes of subsequent calculations of
such ratio, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually
outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or until the Issuers revoke an election of a Reserved Indebtedness
Amount.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary unless the Issuers elect otherwise, if, on any date, the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions (A) Incurs
Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as permitted by a ratio-based basket and (B) Incurs Indebtedness or
issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under a non-ratio-based basket, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such
date with respect to any Incurrence under the applicable ratio-based basket without giving effect for the Incurrence under such
non-ratio-based basket made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance
of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred
Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date
such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollarequivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt financing to fund an acquisition, or first issued in the case of Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing
would cause the applicable Dollar- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as
the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, being refinanced (plus any Refinancing Expenses).

The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the
currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the
date of such refinancing.

The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is
unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with
respect to the same collateral.

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under clauses (9) or (20), no_
Event of Default pursuant to paragraphs (1), (2) or (5) of “—Defaults” shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a
consequence thereof.

As of the Issue Date, all of the Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor will be Restricted Subsidiaries. None of the Issuers will permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to become an Unrestricted Subsidiary, or any Unrestricted Subsidiary to become a Restricted Subsidiary,
except pursuant to the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary.” For purposes of designating any Restricted Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary, all outstanding Investments by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries (except
to the extent repaid) in the Subsidiary so designated will be deemed to be Restricted Payments or Permitted Investments in an
amount determined as set forth in the last sentence of the definition of “Investments.” Such designation will only be permitted if a
Restricted Payment or Permitted Investment in such amount would be permitted at such time and if such Subsidiary otherwise
meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants
set forth in the Indenture.

For purposes of the covenant described above, if any Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) would be permitted
pursuant to one or more provisions described above and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted
Investments,” the Issuers may divide and classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant and may later divide and reclassify any such Restricted Payment or Investment (or a portion thereof)
between one or more provisions described above and/or one or more clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investments”
in any manner that complies with this covenant. For the avoidance of doubt, any Restricted Payment permitted under this covenant
may be made in the form of a loan.

Unrestricted Subsidiaries may use value transferred from the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries in a
Permitted Investment or a Restricted Investment not prohibited under this covenant to purchase or otherwise acquire Indebtedness
or Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers, Holdings, any direct or indirect parent of Holdings or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries, and to transfer value to the holders of the Capital Stock or any direct or indirect parent of Holdings and to Affiliates
thereof, and such purchase, acquisition, or transfer will not be deemed to be a “direct or indirect” action by the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries_**

The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not
permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective
any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) (i) pay dividends or make any other distributions to the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
on its Capital Stock; or (ii) pay any Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries;

(b) make loans or advances to the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries; or

(c) sell, lease or transfer any of its properties or assets to the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries.

However, the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:

241


-----

(1) contractual encumbrances or restrictions of the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries in
effect on the Issue Date, including pursuant to the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the other documents relating

the definition of “Permitted Debt”;

(2) the Indenture, the Notes, the Guarantees and other documents relating to the Indenture and the Notes;

(3) applicable law or any applicable rule, regulation or order;

(4) any agreement or other instrument of a Person acquired by or merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the
Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or an Unrestricted Subsidiary that is designated a Restricted
Subsidiary that was in existence at the time of such acquisition (or at the time it merges with or into the Parent Guarantor,
any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or assumed in connection with the acquisition of assets from such Person (but,
in each case, not created in contemplation thereof)), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person,
or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired or
designated; provided that in connection with a merger, amalgamation or consolidation under this clause (4), if a Person
other than the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is the successor company with respect to
such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, any agreement or instrument of such Person or any Subsidiary of such
Person, shall be deemed acquired or assumed, as the case may be, by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, at the time of such merger, amalgamation or consolidation;

(5) customary encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts or agreements for the sale of assets applicable to such
assets pending consummation of such sale, including customary restrictions with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary
imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary;

(6) restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers under contracts entered into in the ordinary

of business, to the extent such obligations impose restrictions of the type described in clause (c) in the first paragraph of
this covenant on the property so acquired;

entered into in the ordinary course of business to the extent such obligations impose restrictions of the type described in
clause (c) in the first paragraph of this covenant on the property subject to such lease;

(10) any encumbrance or restriction effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Factoring or Qualified Receivables
Financing that, in the good faith determination of the Issuers, is necessary or advisable to effect such Qualified
Receivables Factoring or Qualified Receivables Financing, as applicable;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction in respect of or contained in other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock
of the Parent Guarantor, any Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant
to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
_Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” provided that (i) such encumbrances and restrictions in respect of or contained_
in any agreement or instrument will not materially affect such Issuer’s ability to make anticipated principal or interest
payments on the Notes (as determined by such Issuer in good faith) or (ii) such encumbrances and restrictions contained
in any agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the holders of the Notes than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture or the Existing Credit Facility Agreement (as determined by
such Issuer in good faith);

(12) any encumbrance or restriction contained in secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the
covenants described under “—Certain Covenants —Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of

assets securing such Indebtedness;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction arising or agreed to in the ordinary course of business, not relating to any Indebtedness,
and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, (x) detract from the value of the property or assets of the Parent
Guarantor, such Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any manner material to the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary or (y) materially affect the Issuers’ ability to make future principal or interest payments on the
Notes, in each case, as determined by such Issuer in good faith;

(14) customary provisions in joint venture agreements or arrangements and other similar agreements or arrangements
relating solely to the applicable joint venture; and

(15) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (a), (b) and (c) in the first paragraph of this covenant
imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements
or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) through
(14) of this second paragraph of this covenant; provided that such encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such
amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing are, in the
good faith judgment of such Issuer, not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than the encumbrances and
restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement
or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or
liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock shall not be deemed a restriction
on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the subordination of loans or advances made to the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness incurred by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any such Restricted
Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or advances.

**_Asset Sales_**

The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not
permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless:

(1) the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including
by way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the
time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor,
such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or
otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor, together with all other Asset
Sales since the Existing Dollar Notes Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets;
_provided that the amount of:_

(a) any liabilities (as shown on the Parent Guarantor’s, such Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent
balance sheet or in the notes thereto for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding such date or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities
that would have been reflected on the Parent Guarantor’s, such Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s
balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date
of such balance sheet in the good faith determination of such Issuer) of the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that are
extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale, or that are assumed by the
transferee of any such assets or Equity Interests, in each case, pursuant to an agreement that releases or
indemnifies the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from further
liability;

(b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or

or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days of
the receipt thereof; and

(c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated
Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this subclause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed
the greater of (x) $100 million and (y) 40.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, calculated at the time of
the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated
Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes
in value);

shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this clause (2).

Within 540 days after the Parent Guarantor’s, the relevant Issuer’s or Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of
any Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the
Applicable Percentage of such Net Cash Proceeds (the “Applicable Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale, at its option:

(1) (a) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (a) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified
_Stock and Preferred Stock”; (b) unless included in sub-clause (a), to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (i) any series of_
Notes and/or (ii) any Indebtedness (other than the Notes or Subordinated Indebtedness) that is secured by a Lien on the
Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes in the case of clause (1)(b)(ii), at a price of no more than 100% of such
applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or
redemption; or (c) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than
Subordinated Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor, an Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary);

(2) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of such series of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal
to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but
not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date) or redeem any series of Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the
Indenture or by making an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);
_provided, however, that to the extent the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary have elected to_
purchase any amount of the Notes at a price not less than par, to the extent holders elect not to tender their Notes for
such purchase, the Issuers will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Cash Proceeds equal to such amount not
tendered, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds;

(3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses, assets (other than working capital assets), or property or capital
expenditures, in each case used or useful in a Similar Business;

(4) to make an investment (including capital expenditures) in any one or more businesses, properties (other than working
capital assets) or assets (other than working capital assets) that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that
are the subject of such Asset Sale; or

(5) any combination of the foregoing;

_provided that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the provisions_
described in clause (4) or (5) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 540 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net
Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, has entered into and not
abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment in compliance with the provision described in clauses (4) or
(5) of this paragraph, and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 540-day period. Such 540day period (as may be extended pursuant to this paragraph) shall constitute the “Proceeds Application Period.”

“Applicable Percentage” means 100%; provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or
would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale

244


-----

and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.75 to 1.00 but equal to or greater than
4.25 to 1.00 or (2) 0% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First
Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.25 to 1.00.

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted
Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net
Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

If, with respect to any Asset Sale, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Sale, there
remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (such
amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA,
“Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Issuers shall make an
offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) no later than ten Business Days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all holders
of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase
the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be
purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted
value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as
may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The
Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer at any time prior to the
expiration of the application period.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in
connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers
may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise
prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise
surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall select the applicable Notes
(and the Issuers or their agents shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon
completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent that any of or all the Excess Proceeds of any Asset Sales
(x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated or (y) would result in adverse tax consequences, as
determined by the Issuers in their sole discretion, an amount equal to the portion of such Excess Proceeds so affected will not be
required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and such amounts may be retained by the applicable selling Subsidiary;
provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required,
such repatriation of any of such affected Excess Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, an amount equal to such
amount of Excess Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any Taxes, costs or expenses that would
be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with
this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the
avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be
construed to require the Issuers or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash.

To the extent the Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms
thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuers need only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant
and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the Issuers’ discretion. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule
14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable
in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof.

The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an
Asset Sale may be waived or modified as described in the first sentence of “—Amendments and Waivers.”

The Existing Credit Facility Agreement prohibits or limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers
become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the
Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers or one of their Affiliates could seek the consent of their lenders or

245


-----

investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers or one
of their Affiliates do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In
such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture.

If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuers are required to purchase, selection of such Notes for
purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes
are listed (so long as the Paying Agent knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the total
amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only
Notes in denominations of the minimum denomination of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof shall be
purchased (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by Euroclear and Clearstream)), by lot or by such other
method as the Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements
and, in the case of Global Notes, the procedures of the Despositary); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not
result in a holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of €100,000 (or, in each case, such lower
denomination as may be permitted by Euroclear and Clearstream). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the minimum
denomination of such Note would be left outstanding.

Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten days but not
more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance
with the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee and any Paying Agent). If any Note
is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount
thereof that has been or is to be purchased.

A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note) purchased in part will be
issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuers default
in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not
permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose
of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction or
series of transactions, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate of
the Issuers involving aggregate consideration in excess of $50 million (each of the foregoing, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless
such Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable to the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that could have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Parent Guarantor, the
relevant Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s-length basis (as determined in good faith by
the senior management or the Board of Directors of the relevant Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the relevant Issuer).

Guarantor or the Issuers; provided that such parent entity shall have no material liabilities and no material assets (other
than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers) and such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture and effected for a bona fide
business purpose;

(2) (a) Restricted Payments permitted by the Indenture and (b) Permitted Investments (other than Permitted Investments
under clause (13) of the definition thereof);

(3) transactions in which the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is fair to the Parent
Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or meets the requirements of clause
(a) of the preceding paragraph;

directors, managers, consultants or independent contractors for bona fide business purposes or in the ordinary course
of business;

supplemented or replaced (so long as such amendment, supplement or replacement agreement or arrangement is not
materially disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the senior management of such Issuer or any direct or indirect
parent of the Issuers) to the holders of the Notes when taken as a whole as compared to the original agreement or
arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date) or any transaction or payments contemplated thereby;

(6) the Management Incentive Payments;

(7) the existence of, or the performance by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of its
obligations under the terms of any stockholders or similar agreement (including any registration rights agreement or

arrangements or agreements which it may enter into thereafter; _provided,_ _however, that the existence of, or the_
performance by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries of its obligations under, any
future amendment to any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement or under any similar transaction,
arrangement or agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that
the terms of any such existing transaction, arrangement or agreement, together with all amendments thereto, taken as
a whole, or new transaction, arrangement or agreement are not otherwise disadvantageous (as determined in good faith
by the senior management of the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers) to the holders of the Notes, in
any material respect when taken as a whole as compared with the original transaction, arrangement or agreement as in
effect on the Issue Date;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case, in the ordinary
course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture, which are fair to the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries or are on terms at least as favorable (as determined in good faith by the
senior management of the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers) as might reasonably have been obtained
at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(10) the sale, issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers;

expenses incurred by any Investor or a direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers in connection
therewith);

(13) any transaction with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely
because the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an Equity Interest in or otherwise controls
such Person; provided that no Affiliate of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of their Subsidiaries (other than the
Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall have a beneficial interest or otherwise participate in such
Person;

(14) transactions between the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries and any Person that would
constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because such Person is a director, or such Person has a director who is also a

(27) intercompany transactions undertaken in good faith for the purpose of improving the tax efficiency of the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth
herein.

**_Limitations on Holding Company Activities_**

Holdings shall not conduct, transact or otherwise engage in any material business or operations except for a Permitted Holding
Company Activity.

**_Liens_**

The Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor
to, directly or indirectly, create or Incur any Lien securing Indebtedness other than Permitted Liens (each, a “Subject Lien”) on
any asset or property of any of the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Subsidiary Guarantor, unless:

(1) in the case of Subject Liens on any Collateral, such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien; and

(2) in the case of any Subject Lien on any asset or property that is not Collateral, (i) the Notes (or a Guarantee in the case
of Subject Liens on assets or property of a Guarantor) are equally and ratably secured with (or on a senior basis to, in
the case such Subject Lien secures any Subordinated Indebtedness) the Obligations secured by such Subject Lien until
such time as such Obligations are no longer secured by such Subject Lien or (ii) such Subject Lien is a Permitted Lien.

Any Lien that is granted to secure the Notes or the applicable Guarantee pursuant to the preceding paragraphs shall be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged at the same time as the release of the Lien that gave rise to the
obligation to secure the Notes or the Guarantee under the applicable preceding paragraphs (other than a release as a result of the
enforcement of remedies in respect of such Lien or the Obligations secured by such Lien).

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time of the Incurrence of
such Indebtedness, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness. The “Increased
**Amount” of any Indebtedness shall mean any increase in the amount of such Indebtedness in connection with any accrual of**
interest, the accretion of accreted value, the amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, accretion of original issue discount or liquidation preference, any fees, underwriting discounts,
accrued and unpaid interest, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in connection therewith and increases in the amount
of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property
securing Indebtedness.

**_Reports and Other Information_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuers will provide to the Trustee and, upon request, to
holders of the Notes a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 120 days (or, 150 days with respect to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021) after the end of each fiscal year
(or such longer period as may be permitted by the SEC if the Parent Guarantor were then subject to SEC reporting
requirements as a non-accelerated filer, including under Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), annual
audited financial statements for such fiscal year including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to the periods presented (and including, for the avoidance of doubt,
with respect to any significant acquisition or disposition consummated within the period, pro forma revenues, net income,
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA pro forma for such acquisition or disposition, unless such
_pro forma information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) of this covenant) and a report_

249


-----

on the annual financial statements by the Parent Guarantor’s independent registered public accounting firm or the foreign
analog thereof (the “Auditor”) (all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent
with the corresponding financial information included in this Offering Memorandum),

(2) within 45 days (or 60 days for the next three fiscal quarters ended after the Issue Date (other than any fourth fiscal
quarter)) after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or such longer period as may be
permitted by the SEC if the Parent Guarantor were then subject to SEC reporting requirements as a non-accelerated
filer, including under Rule 12b-25 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), unaudited financial statements for the
interim period as of, and for the period ending on, the end of such fiscal quarter including a “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (and including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect
to any significant acquisition or disposition consummated within the period, pro forma revenues, net income, EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA pro forma for such acquisition or disposition, unless such pro forma
information has been provided in a previous report pursuant to clauses (1) or (3) of this covenant) (all of the foregoing
financial information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum), and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Issuers announce publicly or any acquisition, disposition or
restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or any senior executive officer or director changes at the Parent Guarantor or a change
in auditors of the Parent Guarantor, a report containing a description of such event.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, (a) none of the Issuers will be required to furnish any information,
certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or related Items
307 or 308 of Regulation S-K or (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any nongenerally accepted accounting principles financial measures contained therein, (b) the information and reports referred to in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant will not be required to contain the separate financial statements or
other information contemplated by Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (c) to the extent pro forma
financial information is required to be provided by the Issuers, the Issuers may provide only pro forma revenues, net income and
the cumulative effect of accounting changes, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA (if applicable), senior
secured debt, total debt and capital expenditures (or equivalent financial information) in lieu thereof, (d) the information and reports
referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be required to present compensation or
beneficial ownership information, (e) the information and reports referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this
covenant shall not be required to include any exhibits required by Item 15 of Form 10-K, Item 6 of Form 10-Q or Item 9.01 of Form
8-K, (f) trade secrets and other proprietary information may be excluded from any disclosures and (g) no required report will be
required to contain any “segment reporting.” If at any time the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of
the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers has made a good faith determination to file a registration statement with the SEC with respect
to an Equity Offering of such entity’s Capital Stock, the Issuers will still be required to provide reports pursuant to this covenant but
the content of such reports will not be required to disclose any information that, in the good faith view of the Issuers, would violate
the securities laws or the SEC’s “gun jumping” rules or otherwise have an adverse effect on such Equity Offering.

For so long as the Issuers have designated certain of the Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the first paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation (which need
not be audited or reviewed by the Auditors), either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, or in the
“Management’s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations” or other comparable section, of the financial
position and results of operations of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial position and results of
operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuers will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, the
Issuers will furnish to holders of the Notes, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act (or any successor provision).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information, auditors’ reports and other documents required to be provided
as described above, may be, rather than those of the Parent Guarantor, those of (a) any predecessor or successor of the Parent
Guarantor or any entity meeting the requirements of clause (b) or (c) of this paragraph, (b) any Wholly Owned Subsidiary that,
together with their consolidated Subsidiaries, constitutes substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuers and their consolidated Subsidiaries (“Qualified Reporting Subsidiary”) or (c) any direct or indirect parent of the Parent
Guarantor or the Issuers; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or
such direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers, the same is accompanied by consolidating information, which

250


-----

may be posted to the websites of the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Parent Guarantor or
the Issuers or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers
or a third party, that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Qualified Reporting
Subsidiary or such parent entity (as the case may be), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Parent Guarantor, the
Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating
information referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by the Auditors.

The Issuers will be deemed to have satisfied the information and reporting requirements of the first paragraph of this covenant if
(a) the Issuers or any Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers has filed reports or registration
statements containing such information (including the information required pursuant to the first sentence of the immediately
preceding paragraph, which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not be filed with the SEC via EDGAR to the extent it is otherwise
provided to holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant) with the SEC via the EDGAR (or successor) filing system within the
applicable time periods after giving effect to any extensions permitted by the SEC and that are publicly available or (b) with respect
to the holders of the Notes only, the Issuers or such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary or such parent entity has made such reports
available electronically (including by posting to a non-public, password-protected website as provided above) pursuant to this
covenant. The Trustee shall have no duty to determine whether any filings have been made.

So long as Notes are outstanding, the Issuers will use commercially reasonable efforts to:

(a) promptly after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first
paragraph of this covenant, hold a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant
reporting period; and

(b) announce by press release or post to the websites of the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers or on a
non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuers or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers or a third
party, which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment (but not restrict the recipients of such information from trading
securities of the Issuers or their respective affiliates), prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in
accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph, the time and date of such conference call and either all information
necessary to access the call or informing holders of Notes, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes, bona fide market
makers in the Notes affiliated with any Initial Purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis
of an investment in the Notes) how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the applicable password
or other login information;

_provided, however, that the Issuers will be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of clause (a) of this paragraph if any direct_
or indirect parent of the Issuers holds a conference call to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant
reporting period.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any failure to comply with this covenant shall be automatically cured if any Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent of any Issuer, as the case may be, provides all required reports to the noteholders with a copy to
the Trustee or files all required reports with the SEC via the EDGAR filing system. Delivery of any reports, information and
documents to the Trustee pursuant to this section will be for informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s receipt thereof shall
not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including
the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture. The Trustee does not have a duty to verify the accuracy of
such financial statements and/or reports.

**_Future Guarantors_**

If, on or after the Issue Date, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary (including any newly formed, newly acquired or newly redesignated
Restricted Subsidiary, but excluding any Receivables Subsidiary, any CFC, any direct or indirect subsidiary of a CFC) that is not
then an Issuer or a Guarantor (x) guarantees or borrows or issues any Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement
(or any refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof) or (y) guarantees any capital markets Indebtedness with an aggregate principal
amount in excess of the greater of (x) $250 million and (y) 75.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (“Certain Capital Markets
**Debt”) or (b) the Issuers otherwise elect to have any Restricted Subsidiary become a Guarantor, then, in each such case, the**
Issuers shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture substantially in the
form attached to the Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the Indenture
providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture and
applicable to the other Guarantors; provided that, in the case of clause (a), such supplemental indenture shall be executed and
delivered to the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar within 20 Business Days of the date that such Indebtedness under

251


-----

the Existing Credit Facility Agreement or such Certain Capital Markets Debt has been guaranteed, co-borrowed or co-issued by
such Restricted Subsidiary.

In the event that any Restricted Subsidiary has not provided a Guarantee in respect of the Notes because such Restricted
Subsidiary is a Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a FSCHO, or a direct or indirect subsidiary of a CFC or FSCHO and on any
subsequent date such Restricted Subsidiary no longer constitutes a Receivables Subsidiary, a CFC, a FSCHO, or a direct or
indirect subsidiary of a CFC or FSCHO but is an obligor or guarantor with respect to the Existing Credit Facility Agreement or
Certain Capital Markets Debt, then the Issuers shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent and the Registrar within 20 Business Days of such subsequent date a supplemental indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the Indenture providing for a Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary
on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture and applicable to other Guarantors.

Each Guarantee will be limited as necessary to reflect limitations under local law in the applicable jurisdiction and defenses
generally available to guarantors in such jurisdiction (including those relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer,
voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, corporate benefit, capital maintenance and similar laws, regulations
and defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. This includes limiting
Guarantees to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without
rendering the Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law. However, such limitations may
not be effective under local law.

Each Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture described under “—
_Guarantees.”_

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security
Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Liens shall
under no circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the
Trustee and the holders, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that (i) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the
Restricted Subsidiaries may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise modify or replace any Security
Documents for the purposes of Incurring Permitted Liens, (ii) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries
may amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement, release or otherwise confirm, retake, modify or replace any Security Documents
for the purposes of undertaking a Permitted Reorganization or a transaction not prohibited by the covenant set forth under “—
_Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or Substantially all Assets,” (iii) the Collateral may be discharged and released_
in accordance with the Indenture, the applicable Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (iv) the applicable Security Documents may be amended from time to time to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission,
defect, error or inconsistency therein and (v) the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries may amend the
Security Interests in any manner that does not adversely affect holders in any material respect; provided, however, that in the case
of clause (i), (ii) or (v) above, the Security Documents may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released
or otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuers deliver to the Trustee, either (a) a
solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming
the solvency of the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (as applicable), after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement,
(b) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
which confirms the solvency of the Issuers or the relevant Person granting such Security Interests, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, or
(c) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any
transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the
Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released, modified
or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that
such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement.

-----

In the event that the Issuers comply with the requirements of this covenant, each of the Trustee and the Security Agent shall
(subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and secured to its satisfaction) consent to such
amendments without the need for instructions from the holders.

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of any Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by Holdings, the Parent Guarantor,
the Issuers or the Restricted Subsidiaries of any (x) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and
_Preferred Stock” or clauses (a), (d) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (j), (l), (m), (n), (o), (cc) or (dd) of_
the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and
_Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and (y) any refinancing Indebtedness in respect of the Indebtedness referred_
to in the foregoing clause (x), Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and
the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized representatives) an intercreditor
agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing
Intercreditor Agreement on substantially similar terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the
holders, taken as a whole); provided that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee or Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, duties,
liabilities, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or Security Agent under the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, at the direction of the Issuers and without the consent of holders, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security Document to: (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2)
increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by Holdings, the Parent
Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor
Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the amendment of provisions relating to new Indebtedness, including, but not
limited to, the amendment of the definition of discharge date to include such Indebtedness, the amendment of provisions with
respect to the release of Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests and the amendment of provisions relating
to Indebtedness that will be secured on a super priority basis on market-standard terms), (3) add a co-issuer or Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Notes (including
Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Notes, (6) implement any
Permitted Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the holders in any material respect.
The Issuers shall not otherwise direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement
without the consent of the holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise
permitted below under “—Amendments and Waivers” or as permitted by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, and the Issuers may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any amendment to the
extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the opinion of the Trustee
or Security Agent, adversely affect their respective rights, duties, liabilities, indemnifications or immunities under the Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture will also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee
(and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that
such transaction would comply with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture will also provide that each holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms
and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into
in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement and irrevocably appointed the Trustee and the Security Agent to act on its behalf to enter
into and comply with such provisions and the provisions of any Additional Intercreditor Agreements described above. A copy of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal
business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices.

**Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of All or Substantially All Assets**

The Indenture will provide that none of the Issuers may merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not such
Issuer is the surviving Person), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its properties
or assets in one or more related transactions, to any Person unless:

(1) such Issuer is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation, merger, amalgamation
or winding-up (if other than such Issuer) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition will have been made is (or is the foreign analog of) a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited
liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the
District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted
on the Issue Date) (such Issuer or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the “Successor Company”);
_provided that after giving effect to any such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease,_
conveyance or disposition, (x) an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or
territory thereof or the District of Columbia, shall be or become a co-issuer of the Notes and (y) an entity that is organized
or existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg shall in each case be or become a co-issuer of the Notes
unless, in the case of this clause (y), not doing so would not result in material adverse tax consequences for the Holders
or the Successor Company and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries;

(2) the Successor Company (if other than such Issuer) expressly assumes all the obligations of such Issuer under the
Indenture and the Notes pursuant to supplemental indentures or other documents or instruments;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the
Successor Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the
Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing;

(4) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, as if such transaction had occurred at the beginning of the
applicable four-quarter period, either:

(a) such Issuer (or a Successor Company, if applicable) would be permitted to Incur at least $1.00 of additional
Indebtedness as Ratio Debt; or

(b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for such Issuer (or a Successor Company, if applicable) and the Restricted
Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) would be greater than or equal to such ratio for such Issuer and the
Restricted Subsidiaries immediately prior to such transaction;

(5) each Guarantor, unless it is the other party to the transactions described above, shall have by supplemental indenture
confirmed that its Guarantee shall apply to such Guarantor’s Obligations under the Indenture and the Notes; and

(6) such Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger, amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indentures (if any) comply with the Indenture,
and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company; provided, that
in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact. The Trustee shall
be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel without liability or independent
verification.

The Successor Company (if other than such Issuer) will succeed to, and be substituted for, such Issuer under the Indenture and
the Notes, and such Issuer will automatically be released and discharged from its obligations under the Indenture and the Notes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing clauses (3) and (4), (a) an Issuer may consolidate or amalgamate with, merge into or sell, assign,
transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or part of its properties and assets to any other Issuer or any Guarantor, (b) an
Issuer may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate of such Issuer solely for the purpose of reincorporating or
reorganizing such Issuer in another state of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, the United
Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on Issue Date), so long as the principal
amount of Indebtedness of such Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries is not increased thereby (unless such increase is permitted
by the Indenture), (c) an Issuer may convert into a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust,

254


-----

or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such
Issuer or the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, (d) an Issuer may enter into a
Permitted Reorganization, (e) an Issuer or any Guarantor may change its name and (f) any Restricted Subsidiary may merge,
amalgamate or consolidate with any Issuer so long as such Issuer is the Successor Company in such merger, amalgamation or
consolidation; provided that, in the case of each of clauses (a), (b) and (c), if the resulting entity is not organized or existing under
the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, a co-issuer of the Notes remains in existence
or is organized or existing under such laws; provided further that, in each case of clauses (a) through (f), after giving effect to the
applicable consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or disposition, (x) an entity that is
organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District of Columbia, shall be or
become a co-issuer of the Notes and (y) an entity that is organized or existing under the laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg
shall in each case be or become a co-issuer of the Notes unless, in the case of this clause (y), not doing so would not result in
material adverse tax consequences for the Holders or the Successor Company and/or the Restricted Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will further provide that, subject to certain provisions in the Indenture governing release of a Guarantee upon the
sale or disposition of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor, each Subsidiary Guarantor will not, and the Parent Guarantor
and the Issuers will not permit any such entity to, consolidate, merge or amalgamate with or into or wind up into (whether or not
such entity is the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties or assets in one or more related transactions to, any Person unless:

(1) (a)such Subsidiary Guarantor is the surviving Person or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation,
merger, amalgamation or winding-up (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability
company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District
of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the
Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided by such surviving Person under the
laws of such jurisdiction is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of
formation of the predecessor Guarantor (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may be, being herein called the
“Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations of such
Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture or other
documents or instruments;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation
of the Successor Guarantor or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries as a result of such transaction as having
been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(d) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger,
amalgamation or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the Indenture; or

(2) such sale or disposition or consolidation, amalgamation or merger is made in compliance with the covenant described
under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” to the extent applicable on the date of the subject transaction.

Subject to certain limitations described in the Indenture, the Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, such
Guarantor under the Indenture and such Guarantor’s Guarantee, and such Guarantor will automatically be released and discharged
from its obligations under the Indenture and any Guarantee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) a Guarantor may merge, consolidate or amalgamate with an Affiliate of the Issuers incorporated
or organized solely for the purpose of reincorporating or reorganizing such Guarantor in the United States, any state or territory
thereof or the District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is
constituted on the Issue Date), so long as the principal amount of Indebtedness of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries is
not increased thereby (unless such increase is permitted by the Indenture), (2) a Guarantor may (a) consolidate, merge or
amalgamate with or into or wind up into, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to, any Issuer or a Guarantor or (b) dissolve if such Guarantor sells, assigns, transfers, leases, conveys or
otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of its properties and assets to another Person in compliance with the covenant

255


-----

described under “—Certain Covenants—Asset Sales” and after giving effect to such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance
or disposition and prior to such dissolution, has no or a de minimis amount of assets, (3) a Guarantor may convert into a corporation,
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability company or trust, or the foreign analog of any of the foregoing entities, organized
or existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Guarantor or the laws of the United States, any state or territory
thereof or the District of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is
constituted on the Issue Date) or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided under the laws of such
jurisdiction is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of such Guarantor
prior to such conversion, (4) a Guarantor may change its name and (5) any Restricted Subsidiary (other than the U.S. Issuer or
the Luxembourg Issuer) may merge, amalgamate or consolidate into any Guarantor; provided, in the case of this clause (5), that
the surviving Person (i) is a corporation, partnership, limited partnership or limited liability company or trust, or the foreign analog
of any of the foregoing entities, organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any state or territory thereof or the District
of Columbia, the United Kingdom or the laws of any member country of the European Union (as it is constituted on the Issue Date)
or the laws of any other jurisdiction so long as a Guarantee provided by such surviving Person under the laws of such jurisdiction
is substantially equivalent to the Guarantee provided under the laws of the jurisdiction of formation of the predecessor Guarantor
or the laws of the jurisdiction of organization of such Restricted Subsidiary or Guarantor and (ii) is or becomes a Guarantor upon
consummation of such merger, amalgamation or consolidation and (6) any Guarantor may enter into a Permitted Reorganization.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no restriction described under “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale of all or
_Substantially all Assets” shall limit the ability of any non-Guarantor Subsidiary or Unrestricted Subsidiary to engage in any merger,_
consolidation, amalgamation or sale of all or substantially all assets.

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of an Issuer, which properties and assets, if held by such Issuer instead of
such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall
be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of such Issuer.

**Defaults**

An Event of Default with respect to the Notes of any series will be defined in the Indenture as:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on such series of Notes when due, continued for 30 days;

(2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of such series of Notes when due at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required purchase, upon acceleration or otherwise;

(3) the failure by Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after receipt
of written notice referred to below with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to
in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in such series of Notes or the Indenture; provided that in the case of a failure to
comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such
period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has
been given;

(4) (x) the failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay the principal amount of any
Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Parent Guarantor, an
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or (y) the acceleration of any
Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Parent Guarantor, an
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if the
total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid at final maturity or accelerated exceeds $300 million or its foreign currency
equivalent;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuers or a Significant Subsidiary;

(6) failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final and non-appealable judgment or
judgments aggregating in excess of $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts that are covered
by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent insurance companies), which judgment or judgments are not
discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and, in the event

256


-----

such judgment or judgments are covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor
upon such judgment or judgments or decree which is not promptly stayed; or

(7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security
Agent) with respect to any material portion of the Collateral for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security
interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers (or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries) shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each
case) any such Default continues for 10 days; and

(8) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms
thereof or of the Indenture), or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies in writing that it has any further
liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination or discharge of
the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture and such Default continues for ten
days.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or
involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or
regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clause (3) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series
of Notes until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series notify in writing the
Issuers of the Default and such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of the first paragraph above after receipt
of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer) occurs
and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding
Notes of such series by written notice to the Issuers (and to the Trustee, if given by holders of Notes of such series) may declare
the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest, on all Notes outstanding of such series to be due and payable.
Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default
relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the
outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any
holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of a series may rescind
any such acceleration with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series by written notice to the Trustee
may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes of such series, (i) waive, rescind or cancel any declaration of an existing or past
Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing
Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the Notes of such series (other than such
nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due as a result of such acceleration)) or (ii) or waive compliance with any
provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or the Guarantees if, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such waiver,
rescission or cancellation, as applicable, would not conflict with any judgment or decree. Upon any waiver of a Default or Event of
Default effected pursuant to clause (i) of the previous sentence with respect to any series of Notes, such Default or Event of Default
shall cease to exist with respect to such series of Notes, and any Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the
Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences
thereof will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes of
such series, if prior to 30 days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuers deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating
that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount

257


-----

of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of
Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been cured.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee will be under no obligation to
exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have
offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (which
includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel). Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any)
or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of any series unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have requested in
writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it in its sole discretion in
respect of any loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel);

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security
and/or indemnity; and

(5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have not given the Trustee a written
direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture and, if applicable, any Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of a majority
in principal amount of outstanding Notes of any series are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to
such series of Notes. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior
to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel) that may be
caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate regarding
compliance with the Indenture. Upon any Officer of any of the Issuers becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the
Issuers also are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or Event of
Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period), an Officer’s Certificate
specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes); _provided_ that (x) if any such amendment or
supplement will only affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then only
the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required
and (y) if any such amendment or supplement by its terms will affect a series of Notes in a manner that is different from and
materially adverse relative to the manner in which such amendment or supplement affects other series of Notes, then the consent
of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required. With
respect to any series of Notes, (i) any Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes or (ii) compliance with any
provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or the Guarantees may, in each case, be waived as provided in the fifth
paragraph under “—Defaults.” However, without the consent of holders holding not less than 90% of any series of Notes, then
outstanding, no amendment, supplement or waiver may (with respect to any Notes of such series held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Notes of such series whose holders must consent to an
amendment, supplement or waiver;

258


-----

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on any Note of such series;

(3) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note of such series;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes of such
series, except a rescission of acceleration of the Notes of such series with respect to a nonpayment default by the holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such series and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration;

(5) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note of such series or change the time at which any Note of
such series may be redeemed as described under “—Optional Redemption” (other than, in each case, any change to
the notice periods with respect to such redemptions) or “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons”;

(6) make any Note of such series payable in money other than that stated in such Note;

(7) impair the right of any holder of Notes of such series to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with
respect to such holder’s Notes;

(8) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or Events of Default or the rights
of holders of Notes of such series to receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes of such
series;

(9) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable
Security Documents;

(10) make the Notes of such series or any Guarantee subordinated in right of payment to any other obligations; or

(11) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions of the Indenture that require the holders’ consent as described
in clauses (1) through (10) of this sentence.

A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuers or any Affiliate of such Issuer holds the Note; provided that in
determining whether the holders of the requisite majority of outstanding Notes, or the outstanding Notes of any series, have
given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Notes of such series owned by the
Issuers or any Affiliate of such Issuer shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding if such ownership is known by a
Trust Officer.

Without the consent of any holder of Notes of any series, the Issuers, any Guarantor (with respect to a Guarantee or the Indenture
to which it is a party) and the Trustee may amend or supplement any Notes Documents:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency identified in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the
Trustee,

(2) to conform the text of the Indenture (including any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which
Additional Notes are issued), the Guarantees or the Notes of such series to this “Description of the Notes” or, with respect
to any Additional Notes and any supplemental indenture or other instrument pursuant to which such Additional Notes are
issued, to the “Description of the Notes” relating to the issuance of such Additional Notes solely to the extent that such
“Description of the Notes” provides for terms of such Additional Notes that differ from the terms of the initial Notes, as
contemplated by “—General” above,

(3) to comply with the covenant relating to mergers, amalgamations, consolidations and sales of assets,

(4) to provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of an Issuer or any Guarantor under any Notes
Document,

(5) to provide for uncertificated Notes of such series in addition to or in place of certificated Notes of such series; provided
that the uncertificated Notes of such series are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code,

259


-----

(6) (A) to add or release Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Indenture with respect to the Notes of such series
or (B) to add additional co-Issuer of the Notes of such series to the extent it does not result in adverse tax consequences
to the holders,

(7) to secure the Notes of such series,

(8) to add to the covenants of the Issuers for the benefit of the holders or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuers or any Guarantor,

(9) to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder in any material respect upon delivery to the
Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate certifying the absence of such adverse effect,

(10) to make any amendment to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the transfer and legending of the Notes of such
series as permitted by the Indenture, including, without limitation, to facilitate the issuance and administration of the
Notes of such series; provided, however, that (i) compliance with the Indenture as so amended would not result in Notes
of such series being transferred in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable securities law and (ii) such amendment
does not materially and adversely affect the rights of holders to transfer Notes of such series,

(11) to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee; provided that the successor Trustee
is otherwise qualified and eligible to act as such under the terms of the Indenture,

(12) to provide for or confirm the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the Indenture,

(13) release any security interests granted for the benefit of the holders in the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture or the applicable Security
Documents, or

(14) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in favor of the
Security Agent for the benefit of the holders or parties to the Existing Credit Facility, in any property which is required by
the Security Documents or the Existing Credit Facility (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary
to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such security
interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and
the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with, or

(15) as provided in “—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment. It is
sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or
deletion of “—Change of Control” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” shall be deemed to impair or
affect any rights of holders of the Notes of any series to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the
Notes of such series, and will, for the avoidance of doubt, require the vote of holders described in the first sentence of this “—
_Amendments and Waivers.”_

**No Personal Liability of Managers, Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or holder of any equity interests in any of the Issuers, any
Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuers, as such, will have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers or any
Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation.
Each holder of the Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws and
it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Transfer and Exchange**

A noteholder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the Indenture. Upon any transfer or exchange, the Registrar and
the Trustee may require a noteholder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements or transfer documents and the

260


-----

Issuers may require a noteholder to pay any Taxes required by law or permitted by the Indenture. None of the Issuer nor the
Registrar will be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption (except in the case of a Note to be redeemed
in part, the portion of such Note not to be redeemed) or to transfer or exchange any Note for a period of 15 days prior to a selection
of Notes to be redeemed or tendered and not withdrawn or in connection with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Sale Offer.
The Notes will be issued in registered form and the registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of such Note for all
purposes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect and any collateral then securing the Notes of a series shall
be released (except as to surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, as expressly provided for in the Indenture)
as to all outstanding Notes of a series when:

(1) either (a) all the Notes of such series theretofore authenticated and delivered (except lost, stolen or destroyed Notes of
such series which have been replaced or paid and Notes of such series for whose payment money has theretofore been
deposited in trust or segregated and held in trust by the Issuers and thereafter repaid to the Issuers or discharged from
such trust) have been delivered to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation or (b) all of the Notes of such
series not previously delivered to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) have been called for redemption or are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, for the giving of notice of a full redemption by the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such entity designated (as
agent) by the Trustee or the Issuers for such purpose) in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuers or any Guarantor
have deposited or caused to be deposited in a manner that is not revocable by the Issuers or any of their Affiliates with
the Paying Agent money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire Indebtedness on the Notes of such series not theretofore delivered to the Trustee or the applicable
registrar for cancellation, for principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes of such series to the date of maturity
or redemption, as the case may be, together with irrevocable instructions from the Issuers directing the Trustee and the
Paying Agent to apply such funds to the payment thereof at maturity or redemption, as the case may be;

(2) the Issuers and/or the Guarantors have paid all other sums then due and payable under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel stating that all conditions
precedent under the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture have been complied with.

**Defeasance**

The Issuers at any time may terminate all their obligations under the Notes of any series and the Indenture and have each
Guarantor’s obligation discharged with respect to its Guarantee (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then-existing Events of Default,
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust (as defined below) and obligations to register the
transfer or exchange of the Notes of such series and certain rights of the Trustee, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes of such series and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the Notes of such series. The Issuers at any time
may terminate their obligations and those of each Guarantor under certain covenants that are described in the Indenture, including
the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,” the operation of the cross acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions
with respect to Significant Subsidiaries (other than the U.S. Issuer), the judgment default provision described under “—Defaults”
and the undertakings and covenants contained under “—Change of Control” and “—Merger, Consolidation, Amalgamation or Sale
_of all or Substantially all Assets” (other than clauses (1), (2) and (6) of the first paragraph and clause (1)(d) of the third paragraph_
thereof) (“covenant defeasance”). If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option or their covenant defeasance option, each
Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Guarantee.

The Issuers may exercise their legal defeasance option notwithstanding their prior exercise of their covenant defeasance option.
If the Issuers exercise their legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes of such series may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuers exercise their covenant defeasance option, payment of the Notes of such
series may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (with respect to any Default by the Issuers or
any of the Restricted Subsidiaries with any of their obligations under the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants”), (4),
(5) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries other than the U.S. Issuer), (6) (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries other
than the U.S. Issuer) or (7) under “—Defaults.”

261


-----

In order to exercise either defeasance option with respect to any series of Notes, the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to
be deposited (the “defeasance trust”) with the applicable Paying Agent (or such entity designated as agent by the Issuers and
acceptable to the Trustee (acting reasonably), acting for the Trustee for this purpose) Euros or euro-denominated European
Government Obligations (in each case in an amount sufficient in the opinion of an internationally recognized certified public
accounting firm) for the payment of principal, premium (if any) and interest on the applicable series of Notes to redemption or
maturity, as the case may be; _provided_ that if such redemption is made pursuant to the provisions described in the second
paragraph under “—Optional Redemption,” then: (x) the amount of Euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations
that the Issuers must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited will be determined using an assumed Applicable Premium
calculated as of the date of such deposit, as calculated by the Issuers in good faith, and (y) the Issuers must irrevocably deposit
or cause to be deposited additional cash in Euros in trust on the redemption date as necessary to pay the Applicable Premium as
determined on such date; provided, further, that the Issuers must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that holders of the Notes of such series will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the
same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had
not occurred (and, in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue
Service or change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law after the Issue Date). In each case the Issuer shall have delivered to
the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions
and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating to the applicable defeasance has been complied
with.

**Measuring Compliance**

With respect to any (x) Investment or acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction that has been definitively agreed to
or publicly announced and (y) repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock with
respect to which a notice of repayment (or similar notice), which may be conditional, has been delivered, in each case for purposes
of determining:

(1) whether any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that is being Incurred
in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock is permitted to be Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under the caption “—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock”;_

(2) whether any Lien being Incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing
of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock or to secure any such Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred
in accordance with the covenant described under the caption “—Certain Covenants—Liens” or the definition of “Permitted
Liens”;

(3) whether any other transaction or action undertaken or proposed to be undertaken in connection with such Investment,
acquisition, merger, amalgamation or similar transaction or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (including any Restricted Payments, dispositions, or designations of Restricted
Subsidiaries or Unrestricted Subsidiaries) complies with the covenants or agreements contained in the Indenture or the
Notes;

(4) any calculation of the ratios, baskets or financial metrics, including Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, First Lien Net Leverage
Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Cash Interest
Expense and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings and baskets determined by reference to Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA or Consolidated Total Assets and, whether a Default or Event
of Default exists in connection with the foregoing; and

(5) whether any condition precedent to the Incurrence of Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness), Disqualified
Stock, Preferred Stock, Liens, in each case that is being Incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or
repayment repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is satisfied,

at the option of the Issuers, the date that the definitive agreement for, or public announcement of, such Investment, acquisition or
repayment, repurchase or refinancing or Incurrence of Indebtedness is entered into or the date of any notice, which may be
conditional, of such repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is given to the holders of such Indebtedness (the
“Transaction Commitment Date”) may be used as the applicable date of determination, as the case may be, in each case with

262


-----

such pro forma adjustments as are appropriate and consistent with the pro forma adjustment provisions set forth in the definition
of “Pro Forma Basis” or “Consolidated EBITDA.” For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuers elect to use the Transaction Commitment
Date as the applicable date of determination in accordance with the foregoing, (a) any fluctuation or change in the (i) Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Income,
Consolidated EBITDA, Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Total Assets, Consolidated Cash Interest Expense
and/or Pro Forma Cost Savings of the Issuers and (ii) the applicable exchange rate utilized in calculating compliance with any
dollar-based provision of the Indenture, from the Transaction Commitment Date to the date of consummation of such Investment,
acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, will not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether any Indebtedness or Lien that is being incurred in connection with such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase
or refinancing of Indebtedness, or in connection with compliance by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries with any other provision of the Indenture or the Notes or any other transaction undertaken in connection with such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness, is permitted to be Incurred and (b) until such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness is consummated or such definitive agreements
are terminated, such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness and all transactions
proposed to be undertaken in connection therewith (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens) will be given pro forma
effect when determining compliance of other transactions (including the incurrence of Indebtedness and Liens unrelated to such
Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of Indebtedness) that are consummated after the Transaction
Commitment Date and on or prior to the date of consummation of such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or
refinancing of Indebtedness and any such transactions (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof)
will be deemed to have occurred on the date the definitive agreements are entered into or public announcement is made and
deemed to be outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or ratios under the Indenture after the date of such
agreement and before the date of consummation of such Investment, acquisition or repayment, repurchase or refinancing of
Indebtedness. In addition, the Indenture will provide that compliance with any requirement relating to the absence of a Default or
Event of Default may be determined as of the Transaction Commitment Date and not as of any later date as would otherwise be
required under the Indenture.

For purposes hereof, the “maximum fixed repurchase price” of any Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock that does not have a fixed
repurchase price shall be calculated in accordance with the terms of such Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as if such
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock were purchased on any date on which maximum fixed repurchase price shall be required to
be determined pursuant to the Indenture, and if such price is based upon, or measured by, the fair market value of such Disqualified
Stock or Preferred Stock, such fair market value shall be determined reasonably and in good faith by the Issuers.

To the extent the date of any delivery of any document required to be delivered pursuant to any provision of the Indenture falls on
a day that is not a Business Day, the applicable date of delivery shall be deemed to be the next succeeding Business Day.

For purposes of determining the maturity date of any Indebtedness, customary bridge loans that are subject to customary conditions
(including no payment or bankruptcy event of default) that would either automatically be extended as, converted into or required
to be exchanged for permanent refinancing shall be deemed to have the maturity date as so extended, converted or exchanged.

**Notices**

Notices given by publication will be deemed given on the first date on which publication is made and notices given by first-class
mail, postage prepaid, will be deemed given five calendar days after mailing; notices personally delivered will be deemed given at
the time delivered by hand; notices given by facsimile or email will be deemed given when receipt is acknowledged; and notices
given by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery will be deemed given the next Business Day after timely delivery to
the courier and notices given to Euroclear and/or Clearstream shall be sufficiently given if given according to the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. For so long as any Notes are represented by global notes, all notices to holders of
the Notes may be delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, which will give such notices to the holders of book-entry interests.

**Concerning the Trustee, Security Agent and Agents**

Lucid Trustee Services Limited will be the Trustee and Security Agent under the Indenture. We will appoint The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch, to act as Paying Agent and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, Dublin Branch as registrar and transfer
agent.

The Indenture will contain certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee thereunder, should it become a creditor of the Issuers, to
obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or

263


-----

otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign.

The Indenture will provide that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will have the right to direct
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain
exceptions. The Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, of which a responsible officer of
the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that during the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has written
notice (which shall not be cured), the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree of care of a prudent
person in the conduct of such person’s own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the request of any holder of the Notes, unless such holder shall have offered to
the Trustee and, if requested, provided the Trustee with security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any
loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel).

The Trustee, the Security Agent and Agents will be permitted to engage in transactions with the Issuers and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. The Indenture also will
contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, claim, liability, Taxes and expenses incurred without gross
negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Indenture.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture will provide that it and the Notes (including the consent to jurisdiction and service) and the Guarantees governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. For the avoidance of doubt, the application of the
provisions of articles 470-1 to 470-19 (inclusive) of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies, dated 10 August 1915, as
amended, is excluded.

**Maintenance of Listing**

After the Issue Date, the Issuers will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Notes to be listed on the Official List of The
International Stock Exchange, and to maintain such listing so long as the Notes are outstanding; provided that if (x) the Issuers are
unable to list the Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange, (y) maintenance of the listing of the Notes becomes
unduly onerous, as reasonably determined by the Issuers or (z) the Official List of The International Stock Exchange requires
additional financial information from Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries than is
required pursuant to “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” then the Issuers will, prior to the delisting of the Notes
from the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (if then listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange),
use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain a listing of the Notes on another internationally recognized stock
exchange (in which case, references in this covenant to the Official List of The International Stock Exchange will be deemed to be
refer to such other stock exchange) that would not cause the Issuers or any of the Subsidiaries to become subject to Regulation
(EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse (the “Market Abuse Regulation”) and any applicable delegated regulations thereunder or to
become subject to the Market Abuse Regulation as it forms part of the retained European Union law in the United Kingdom by
virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; provided, further, that if the Official List of The International Stock Exchange
or any such other stock exchange requires Holdings, the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers to publicly file or make available its
financial statements or requires publication of any financial information from Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any of
the Restricted Subsidiaries, then the Issuers shall not be required to maintain any listing on the Official List of The International
Stock Exchange or such other exchange.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Because most of the assets of the Issuers and Guarantors are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United
States against the Issuers or certain Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, if any,
interest, redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectible within the United States. See
“Certain Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”

264


-----

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the Notes (including the consent
to jurisdiction and service) and the Guarantees, the Issuers and each Guarantor that is organized under laws other than the United
States or a state thereof will in the Indenture (1) irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City, County and State of New York, United States, (2) consent that any such action or proceeding may be
brought in such courts and waive any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in
any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agree not to plead or claim the same,
(3) designate and appoint the U.S. Issuer as its authorized agent upon which process may be served in any such action or
proceeding that may be instituted in any such court and (4) agree that service of any process, summons, notice or document by
U.S. registered mail addressed to the U.S. Issuer, with written notice of said service to such Person at the address of the U.S.
Issuer set forth in the Indenture shall be effective service of process for any such action or proceeding brought in any such court.

**Currency Indemnity**

The Euro is the sole currency (the “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable by the Issuers or any
Guarantor under or in connection with the Notes, the Indenture and the Guarantees, including damages. Any amount with respect
to the Notes, Indenture or Guarantees received or recovered in a currency other than the Required Currency, whether as a result
of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution of the Issuers or any
Guarantor or otherwise by any noteholder or by the Trustee or Paying Agent, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from
the Issuers or any Guarantor will only constitute a discharge to the Issuers or any Guarantor to the extent of the Required Currency
amount that the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that
receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do
so).

If that Required Currency amount is less than the Required Currency amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee
or Paying Agent under the Notes, the Issuers and each Guarantor will indemnify such recipient and/or the Trustee or Paying Agent
against any loss sustained by it as a result. In any event, the Issuers and each Guarantor will indemnify the recipient against the
cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the
matter stated therein, for, such recipient (with respect to itself), the holder of a Note (with respect to itself) or the Trustee (with
respect to itself) or Paying Agent to certify in a manner satisfactory to the Issuers (indicating the sources of information used) the
loss it incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers’
and each Guarantor’s other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any such recipient, such holder of a Note or the Trustee or Paying Agent (other than a waiver of the indemnities
set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in
respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee. For the purposes of determining the amount in a currency other than
the Required Currency, such amount shall be determined using the Exchange Rate then in effect.

“Exchange Rate” means, on any day, the rate at which the currency other than the Required Currency may be exchanged into
the Required Currency at approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date on the Bloomberg Key Cross Currency
Rates Page for the relevant currency. In the event that such rate does not appear on any Bloomberg Key Cross Currency Rate
Page, the Exchange Rate shall be determined by the Issuers in good faith.

**Certain Definitions**

actual benefits realized or expected to be realized during such period that are otherwise included in the calculation of Consolidated

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Additional Dollar Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more
global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Additional Dollar **Regulation S Global**
**Notes”). The Additional Dollar Regulation S Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and**
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

The Additional Dollar Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be
represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Additional Dollar
**Rule 144A Global Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Regulation S Global Notes, the “Additional Dollar** **Global**
**Notes”).** The Additional Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered
in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

The Euro Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Euro **Regulation S Global Notes”). The Euro Regulation**
S Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary
for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

The Euro Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A will initially be represented by
one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Euro **Rule 144A Global Notes”**
and, together with the Euro Regulation S Global Notes, the “Euro **Global Notes”). The Euro Global Notes will be deposited with a**
common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

The Additional Dollar Global Notes and the Euro Global Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global Notes.”

Ownership of interests in the Additional Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Additional Dollar Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
in the Additional Dollar Regulation S Global Notes (the “Additional Dollar Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with
the Additional Dollar Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Additional Dollar Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of interests
in the Euro Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Euro Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the Euro Regulation S Global Notes (the
“Euro Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”) and together with the Euro Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Euro Book-Entry
**Interests,” and together with the Additional Dollar Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that**
have accounts with DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or persons that hold interests through such participants.
Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form
by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants, as applicable.

The Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry
form by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, and its participants. Clearstream and Euroclear are direct and indirect participants,
respectively, in DTC and, accordingly, persons who have accounts with Clearstream or Euroclear (or with participants in
Clearstream or Euroclear) may own Book-Entry Interests. The Additional Book-Entry Interests in the Additional Global Notes will
be issued only in denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Euro Book-Entry Interests
in the Euro Global Notes will be issued only in denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on
their book-entry registration and transfer systems the account of a participant with the interest beneficially owned by such
participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of
securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer
or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the New Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have
the New Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the New Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the registered owners or “holders” of New Notes for any purpose.

So long as the New Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or its nominee
will be considered the sole holders of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Euro Indenture or the Dollar Indenture, as
applicable. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests,
in order to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders under the Euro Indenture or the Dollar Indenture, as applicable.

None of the Issuers or the Trustee, Security Agent, Paying Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent or any of their respective affiliates
will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

305


-----

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or its
nominees), as applicable, will distribute the same amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders
of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note.
The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received
by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof).
The Issuers understand that under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, if fewer than all the New
Notes are to be redeemed at any time, and DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and
appropriate; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 or €100,000 principal amount, or, as applicable,
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuers will make payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) to the relevant paying agent. The relevant paying agent will, in turn, make such
payments to DTC or its nominee (in the case of Dollar Global Notes) and to the common depositary or its nominee for Euroclear
and Clearstream (in the case of Euro Global Notes), which will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their
respective procedures. The Issuers will make payments of all such amounts without deduction or withholding for or on account of
any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature, except as may be required by law
and as described under “Description of the Dollar Notes—Withholding Taxes” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Withholding
_Taxes,” as applicable. If any such deduction or withholding is required to be made by applicable law or regulation or otherwise as_
described under “Description of the Dollar Notes—Withholding Taxes” and/or “Description of the Euro Notes—Withholding Taxes,”
as applicable, then, to the extent described under “Description of the Dollar Notes—Withholding Taxes” and/or “Description of the
_Euro Notes—Withholding Taxes,” the Issuers will pay additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts_
received by any holder of the Global Notes or owner of Book-Entry Interests after such deduction or withholding will equal the net
amounts that such holder or owner would have otherwise received in respect of such Global Note or Book-Entry Interest, as the
case may be, absent such withholding or deduction. The Issuers expect that standing customer instructions and customary
practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuers and the Trustee, Principal Paying Agent, Registrar, Transfer Agent and the relevant
agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or its nominees) as the owners
thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustee, Principal
Paying Agent, Registrar, Transfer Agent or any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

� any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable,
or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

� DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant; or

� the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility of such participants.

**Currency of payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar Global Notes will be paid
to holders of interests in the Additional Dollar Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on,
and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through
Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Euros.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable clearing
system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, Principal Paying Agent, Registrar, Transfer
Agent or any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs,
losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such
payment. Holders may be subject to foreign exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

306


-----

**Action by owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of New
Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited
and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of New Notes as to which such participant or participants has
or have given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers
or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an Event of Default under the Notes, each of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserve the right to exchange the relevant Global
Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such definitive
registered notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream rules, as applicable, and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of definitive
registered notes for any reason, including to sell the New Notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such
securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the relevant Global Notes in accordance with the
normal procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
Indentures.

The Global Notes will each bear a legend to the effect set forth under “Transfer Restrictions.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global
Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests will at all times
be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest
only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form to be provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act or any other exemption (if
available under the U.S. Securities Act).

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest
only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer
is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting
the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under “Transfer Restrictions”
and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any other jurisdiction.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interest for a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest,
appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a
corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule 144A Global Note.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note only as described under
“Description of the Dollar Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Transfer and Exchange,” as the
case may be and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such New Notes. See
“Transfer Restrictions.”

Transfers involving an exchange of a Book-Entry Interest in a Regulation S Global Note for a Book-Entry Interest in a 144A Global
Note will be done by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream by means of an instruction originating from the Trustee, and, if through DTC,
through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments
will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the relevant Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase
in the principal amount of the corresponding 144A Global Note. The policies and practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
may prohibit transfers of unrestricted Book-Entry Interests in a Regulation S Global Note prior to the expiration of the 40 days after
the date of issuance of the New Notes. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who
takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest
in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note, and accordingly will thereafter be
subject to all applicable transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Transfer Restrictions,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred and exchanged as
described under “Description of the Dollar Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Transfer and
_Exchange,” as applicable. Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in_

307


-----

the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book- Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will
thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global
Note for as long as it remains such a Book Entry Interest.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) if DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuers that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary and a
successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuers within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream
following an event of default under the Indentures and enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the
Indentures.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream advised us that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry Interest described in the immediately
preceding second bullet point, their current procedure is to request that the Issuers issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive
registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and issued in any approved
denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or the Registrar (in accordance with their respective
customary procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry
Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Indentures, unless that legend
is not required by the Indentures or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuers, the Trustee, the Security Agent, the Transfer Agent, any paying agent and any registrar
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for
treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at
each Issuer’s registered office, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the New Notes.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the New Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur
fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Information concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. We provide the
following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures
of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the
Guarantors, the Trustee, Principal Paying Agent, Registrar, Transfer Agent or any of the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those
operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuers that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking
organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation”
within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of
Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues,
corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also
facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities,
through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities
Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by
the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S.
securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial
relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream:

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants.
Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance
and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with
domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities

308


-----

brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also
available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through Euroclear or Clearstream.

Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear
and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the
ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in Euroclear or
Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The New Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of
interests in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in
accordance with their respective system’s rules and operating procedures.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in
the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to
perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the
Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee, the Registrar or the Paying Agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the
rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Additional Dollar Notes will be made in U.S. dollars and for the Euro Notes in Euros. Book-Entry Interests
owned through DTC will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests
will be credited to the securities custody accounts of DTC holders, as applicable, on the business day following the settlement date
against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the
place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the
seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other communications involving
the New Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, on days when those systems are open for business.
Because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream on the same business day as in jurisdictions outside of the United States.

309

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The statements herein regarding taxation are based on the laws and published practice in force in the relevant jurisdictions as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of which are subject to any changes in law occurring after this date, including changes
made on a retroactive basis, and to differing interpretations. The following summary does not purport to be a comprehensive
description of all of the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to purchase, hold or dispose of the Notes and does
not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of investors, some of which (such as dealers in securities
or commodities or investment funds, mutual funds or pension funds) may be subject to special rules. Prospective purchasers of
the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors concerning the overall tax consequences of their ownership of the Notes.

**Certain EU Tax Considerations**

EU Council Directive 2011/16/EU on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC (the
“Directive on Administrative Cooperation”) establishes rules and procedures on cooperation among the European Commission,
EU Member States, and third states in tax matters.

The Directive on Administrative Cooperation requires three types of exchange of information with respect to taxation. First, a
Member State must upon request communicate any foreseeably relevant information that it has in possession to another Member
State, subject to specific time limits. Second, a Member State must automatically send information that it possesses about a
resident of another Member State to such other state, if such information relates to (i) employment income; (ii) director’s fees;
(iii) life insurance products not covered by other EU legal instruments on exchange of information; (iv) pensions; and (v) ownership
of and income from immovable property. The obligation also requires the exchange of information on advance cross-border rulings
and advance pricing agreements. Third, a Member State must spontaneously communicate information to another Member State
in certain listed situations, e.g. if the competent authority of one Member State has a reason to suppose that there may be a loss
of tax in the other Member State.

The Directive on Administrative Cooperation also sets forth the following forms of administrative cooperation: (i) a Member State
may have its officials present in administrative offices of another Member State; (ii) two or more Member States may conduct
simultaneous controls; (iii) a Member State may have another Member State notify a taxpayer of any instruments and decisions;
(iv) a Member State may request feedback from the Member State to which it provided information; and (v) all Member States
must share best practices and experience in administrative cooperation.

**Certain Luxembourg Tax Considerations**

This summary solely addresses the principal Luxembourg tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposal of Notes
and does not purport to describe every aspect of taxation that may be relevant to a particular holder. Tax matters are complex,
and the tax consequences of the Offering to a particular holder of Notes will depend in part on such holder’s circumstances.
Accordingly, a holder is urged to consult his own tax advisor for a full understanding of the tax consequences of the Offering to
him, including the applicability and effect of Luxembourg tax laws.

Where in this summary English terms and expressions are used to refer to Luxembourg concepts, the meaning to be attributed to
such terms and expressions shall be the meaning to be attributed to the equivalent Luxembourg concepts under Luxembourg tax
law.

This summary is based on the tax law of Luxembourg (unpublished case law not included) as it stands at the date of this Offering
Memorandum. The tax law upon which this summary is based, is subject to changes, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such
change may invalidate the contents of this summary, which will not be updated to reflect such change.

This overview assumes that each transaction with respect to the Notes is at arm’s length.

The summary in this Luxembourg taxation paragraph does not address the Luxembourg tax consequences for a holder of Notes
who:

(i) _is an investor as defined in a specific law (such as the law on family wealth management companies of 11 May_
_2007, as amended, the law on undertakings for collective investment of 17 December 2010, as amended, the law_
_on specialized investment funds of 13 February 2007, as amended, the law on reserved alternative investment_
_funds of 23 July 2016, the law on securitisation of 22 March 2004, as amended, the law on venture capital vehicles_
_of 15 June 2004, as amended and the law on pension saving companies and associations of 13 July 2005;_

(ii) _is, in whole or in part, exempt from tax;_

(iii) _acquires, owns or disposes of Notes in connection with a membership of a management board, a supervisory_
_board, an employment relationship, a deemed employment relationship or management role; or_

310


-----

(iv) _has a substantial interest in the Issuer or a deemed substantial interest in the Issuer for Luxembourg tax purposes._
_Generally, a person holds a substantial interest if such person owns or is deemed to own, directly or indirectly,_
_more than 10% of the shares or interest in an entity._

**Withholding Tax**

**_Non-resident holders of the Notes_**

All payments of interest and principal under the Notes made to non-residents of Luxembourg may be made free from withholding
or deduction of or for any taxes of whatever nature imposed, levied, withheld or assessed by Luxembourg or any political
subdivision or taxing authority of or in Luxembourg.

**_Individual resident holders of the Notes_**

Under the law of 23 December 2005 as amended (the “Relibi **Law”), payments of interest and similar income made or deemed to**
be made to an individual who is resident in Luxembourg may be subject to a withholding tax of 20% of the payment.

**Taxes on Income and Capital Gains**

**_Non-resident holders of the Notes_**

Non-resident holders of the Notes that do not have a permanent establishment or a permanent representative in Luxembourg to
which the Notes or income thereon are attributable to are not subject to Luxembourg income taxes in respect of any benefits
derived or deemed to be derived in connection with the Notes or on capital gains realised on the disposal or redemption of the
Notes.

**_Resident holders of the Notes_**

_Individuals. A resident individual acting in the course of the management of a professional or business undertaking must include_
any interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain realized on the sale or disposal
in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax purposes.

A resident holder of the Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, is subject to Luxembourg income
tax in respect of interest or similar income received (such as premiums or issue discounts) under the Notes, except if tax is levied
on such payments in accordance with the Relibi Law.

A gain realized by an individual holder of the Notes, acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth, upon the
sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes is not subject to Luxembourg income tax, provided this sale or disposal took
place more than six months after the Notes were acquired. However, any portion of such gain corresponding to accrued but unpaid
interest income is subject to Luxembourg income tax, except if tax is levied on such interest in accordance with the Relibi Law.

_Corporations. A corporate resident holder of the Notes must include any benefits derived or deemed to be derived from or in_
connection with the Notes, such as interest accrued or received, any redemption premium or issue discount, as well as any gain
realized on the sale or disposal, in any form whatsoever, of the Notes, in its taxable income for Luxembourg income tax purposes.

_General. If a holder of Notes is neither resident nor deemed to be resident in Luxembourg, such holder will for Luxembourg tax_
purposes not carry on or be deemed to carry on an enterprise, in whole or in part, through a permanent establishment or a
permanent representative Luxembourg by reason only of the execution of the documents relating to the issue of Notes or the
performance by the Issuer of its obligations under such documents or under the Notes.

**_Net Wealth Tax_**

Corporate holders of the Notes resident in Luxembourg and non-resident corporate holders of the Notes that maintain a permanent
establishment or permanent representative in Luxembourg to which or to whom such Notes are attributable are subject to annual
net wealth tax on their unitary value (i.e., non-exempt assets minus liabilities and certain provisions as valued according to the
Luxembourg valuation rules), levied at a rate of 0.5% if the unitary value does not exceed €500,000,000 and 0.05% on the portion
of the unitary value that exceeds €500,000,000 in respect of the Notes.

Individuals are not subject to Luxembourg net wealth tax.

**_Inheritance and Gift Tax_**

Where Notes are transferred for non-consideration:

311


-----

(i) no Luxembourg inheritance tax is levied on the transfer of the Notes upon the death of a holder of Notes in cases
where the deceased was not a resident or a deemed resident of Luxembourg for inheritance tax purposes;

(ii) by way of gift, Luxembourg gift tax will be levied in the event that the gift is made pursuant to a notarial deed signed
before a Luxembourg notary or presented for registration, directly or indirectly, before the Registration and Estates
Department (Administration de l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA).

**_Other Taxes and Duties_**

It is not compulsory that the Notes be filed, recorded or enrolled with any court or other authority in Luxembourg. No registration
tax, stamp duty or any other similar documentary tax or duty is due in respect of or in connection with the issue of Notes, the
performance by the Company of its obligations under the Notes, or the transfer of the Notes.

A fixed or _ad valorem registration duty in Luxembourg may however apply (i) upon voluntary registration (présentation à_
_l’enregistrement) of the Notes before the Registration and Estates Department (Administration de l’enregistrement, des domaines_
_et de la TVA) in Luxembourg, or (ii) if the Notes are (a) enclosed to a compulsory registrable deed under Luxembourg law_ (acte
_obligatoirement enregistrable) or (b) deposited with the official records of a notary (déposé au rang des minutes d’un notaire)._

**Common Reporting Standard**

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a new global standard for the automatic exchange
of financial information between tax authorities (the “CRS”). Luxembourg is a signatory jurisdiction to the CRS and has conducted
its first exchange of information with tax authorities of other signatory jurisdictions in September 2017, as regards reportable
financial information gathered in relation to fiscal year 2016. The CRS has been implemented in Luxembourg via the law dated 18
December 2015 concerning the automatic exchange of information on financial accounts and tax matters and implementing the
EU Directive 2014/107/EU.

The regulations may impose obligations on the Issuer and the Noteholders, if the Issuer is considered as a Reporting Financial
Institution (e.g. an Investment Entity) under the CRS, so that the latter could be required to conduct due diligence and obtain
(among other things) confirmation of the tax residency, tax identification number and CRS classification of Noteholders in order to
fulfil its own legal obligations.

**Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences**

The following is a summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition
of New Notes. The summary is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), existing and proposed Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and published rulings and court
decisions, all as of the date hereof and all subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary deals only
with holders that purchase New Notes pursuant to this Offering and at their issue price (i.e. the first price at which a substantial
amount of the Euro Notes and the Additional Dollar Notes, respectively is sold for money to persons other than bond houses,
brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and that will
hold the New Notes as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment).
The discussion does not cover all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to, or the actual tax effect that any
of the matters described herein will have on, the acquisition, ownership or disposition of New Notes by particular investors, and
does not address state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws. This summary also does not discuss all of the tax considerations that
may be relevant to certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as U.S.
expatriates and former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated
investment companies, investors liable for the alternative minimum tax, investors subject to the Medicare tax on net investment
income, individual retirement accounts and other tax-deferred accounts, tax-exempt organizations, dealers or traders in securities
or currencies, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” corporations that accumulate earnings to
avoid U.S. federal income tax, S corporations, partnerships or other entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (and investors therein), investors that will hold the New Notes as part of straddles, hedging
transactions, conversion transactions or other integrated transactions for U.S. federal income tax purposes, accrual method
taxpayers who are required to recognize income for U.S. federal income tax purposes no later than when such income is taken
into account in applicable financial statements or U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar).

As used herein, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of New Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an
individual citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States or any
state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax without regard to
its source or (iv) a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the

312


-----

trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or the trust has elected to be
treated as a domestic trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

As used herein, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of New Notes that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.

The U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership that holds New Notes will
depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in New Notes,
and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the
purchase, ownership and disposition of New Notes.

**THE SUMMARY OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES SET FORTH BELOW IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION**
**ONLY. ALL PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS AS TO THE PARTICULAR TAX**
**CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF OWNING THE NEW NOTES, INCLUDING THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF STATE,**
**LOCAL, NON-U.S. AND OTHER TAX LAWS AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAW.**

**Additional Dollar Notes are not Fungible with the Existing Dollar Notes**

The Additional Dollar Notes will not be fungible with the Existing Dollar Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and will be
issued and trade with different ISINs and CUSIPs than those assigned to the Existing Dollar Notes.

**_Potential Contingent Payment Debt Instrument Treatment_**

In certain circumstances the Issuers may be required to make payments on a New Note that could change the yield of the New
Note. See “Description of the Dollar Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Euro Notes—Optional Redemption,”
“Description of the Dollar Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Change of Control.” This obligation may
implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”). According to the
applicable Treasury regulations, certain contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a CPDI if such
contingencies, as of the date of issuance, are “remote or incidental” or certain other circumstances apply. The Issuers intend to
take the position that the New Notes are not CPDIs. The Issuers’ position is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder
discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. This determination, however, is not
binding on the IRS and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on the
New Notes that such U.S. Holder owns in excess of stated interest, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting, and to
treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income realized on the taxable disposition of such Notes before the resolution
of all contingencies. If the New Notes are not CPDIs but such contingent payments were required to be made, it would affect the
amount and timing of the income that a U.S. Holder recognizes. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding
the potential application to each series of New Notes of the CPDI rules and the consequences thereof. The remainder of this
discussion assumes that the New Notes will not be treated as CPDIs.

**_Effect of Co-Issuance and Source of Interest Payments_**

The New Notes are co-issued by the U.S. Issuer and the Luxembourg Issuer and, therefore, each Issuer is liable for repayment of
the New Notes in their entirety. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, if a debt obligation has both U.S. and non-U.S. coissuers, there is some uncertainty as to the determination of the source of an interest payment on such debt obligation. Although
the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the source of an interest payment on a New Note will be made
by reference to the residence of the Issuer that makes the payment. Accordingly, subject to the following paragraph, we intend to
treat any interest paid by the U.S. Issuer as U.S.-source income and any interest paid by the Luxembourg Issuer as foreign-source
income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes such treatment. There can be no
assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge this treatment, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling
from the IRS with respect to the treatment of the New Notes or the sourcing of the interest payments on the New Notes. If the
interest payments on the New Notes were sourced in a different manner, the U.S. federal income tax consequences (including
with respect to foreign tax credits) to a Holder would be different than those described below. Holders should consult their own tax
advisors regarding the sourcing of payments on the New Notes. A Holder of New Notes may obtain information regarding the
portion of any interest paid by the U.S. Issuer and the portion of any interest paid by the Luxembourg Issuer by submitting a written
request to the Issuers at the address set forth in the notices provision of each Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the clearing systems require us to designate only one Issuer for U.S. federal withholding tax
purposes, and we intend to designate the U.S. Issuer as the issuer of the New Notes for this purpose. As such, an applicable
withholding agent likely will treat all interest payments on the New Notes as U.S.-source income for U.S. federal withholding tax
purposes.

**_U.S. Holders_**

_Payments of Stated Interest and OID on the New Notes_

Payments of stated interest (which shall include, for purposes of this discussion, any taxes withheld from such payments and any
payments of Additional Amounts) on a New Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is
received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro (in the
case of the Euro Notes) will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the
date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. Holder will not
recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss
attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income
recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first
method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual
period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable
year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot
rate of exchange in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years,
the spot rate of exchange in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of
interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder
may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the day of receipt. Any such
election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election
applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS.

Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder’s receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest
upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note) denominated in euros, the U.S. Holder may recognize U.S.
source foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount
received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt) and the amount previously
accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss
will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally
not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

Interest paid on the New Notes generally will be considered passive category income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.
Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of
income rules to income attributable to the New Notes.

The New Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event that the New Notes are issued with
OID the amount of OID with respect to a New Note includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID
with respect to the New Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such New
Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in
such period. The accrual period of a New Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the New Note,
provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on
the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the
product of the New Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on
the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the
amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a New Note at the start of any accrual period
generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a New
Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under
a New Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of a New Note. A U.S. Holder generally will not be required to recognize
additional income upon the receipt of any cash payment on the New Notes that is attributable to previously accrued OID that has
been included in its income.

_Sale and Retirement of the Additional Dollar Notes_

A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale or retirement (including, for this purpose, any other taxable
disposition) of an Additional Dollar Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or retirement and the
adjusted tax basis of the Additional Dollar Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Dollar Note will generally be
its U.S. dollar cost, increased by any previously accrued but unpaid OID.

The amount realized does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest or OID, which will be treated as
discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest on the New Notes.”

314


-----

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of an Additional Dollar Note will be U.S. source capital gain or
loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Additional Dollar Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year.
Long–term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. Holders is subject to preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject
to limitations.

_Sale and Retirement of the Euro Notes_

A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale or retirement (including, for this purpose, any other taxable
disposition) of a Euro Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or retirement and the adjusted tax
basis of the Euro Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Euro Note will generally be its U.S. dollar cost. The U.S. dollar cost
of a Euro Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price translated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the
date of purchase, or the settlement date for the purchase in the case of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market,
within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations, that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an accrual basis U.S.
Holder that so elects. The amount realized on a sale or retirement for an amount in euros will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount
translated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of sale or retirement, or the settlement date for the sale, in the case of
Euro Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations, sold by a cash
basis U.S. Holder or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in
regard to Euro Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the
U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special
election will recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) to the extent that there are exchange
rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be realized
only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition.

The amount realized does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest which will be treated as discussed
above under “—Payments of Stated Interest on the New Notes.”

Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Euro Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will
be long-term capital gain or loss if the Euro Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Long–term capital gain of
non-corporate U.S. Holders is subject to preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

_Disposition of Euros_

Euros received as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale or retirement of a Euro Note will have an adjusted tax basis equal to their
U.S. dollar value at the time the euros are received. Euros that are purchased will generally have an adjusted tax basis equal to
their U.S. dollar value on the date of purchase. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of euro (including their
use to purchase Euro Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.

**_Non-U.S. Holders_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, U.S.-source interest and OID, if applicable, on a New Note
paid to a Non-U.S. Holder is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, including withholding tax, provided that:

� such interest is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States;

� the Non-U.S. Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of
stock in the U.S. Issuer;

� the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to the U.S. Issuer (actually or constructively) through
stock ownership;

� such Non-U.S. Holder is not a bank whose receipt of such interest is described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code; and

� the Non-U.S. Holder satisfies certain certification requirements.

If the requirements set forth above are not satisfied with respect to a Non-U.S. Holder, amounts treated as payments of U.S.source interest and OID generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless another exemption is
applicable.

A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis on gain from the sale, exchange
or other taxable disposition (including redemption) of a New Note, unless that gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the
Non-U.S. Holder of a trade or business within the United States or, in the case of gain realized by an individual Non-U.S. Holder,
the Non-U.S. Holder is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other
conditions are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent any portion of the amount realized by a Non-U.S. Holder on a sale,

315


-----

exchange or other taxable disposition (including redemption) of a New Note is attributable to accrued but unpaid U.S.-source
interest or OID, if applicable, such portion shall be treated as described in the paragraphs above with respect to U.S.-source
interest payments.

A Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax with respect to interest and OID, if applicable, on a New
Note to the extent that such interest and OID are treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However,
as discussed above under “—Effect of Co-Issuance and Source of Interest Payments,” an applicable withholding agent likely will
treat all payments on the New Notes as U.S.-source for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes.

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Payments of principal and interest and OID on, and the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of, New Notes will be reported to
the IRS and to U.S. Holders as may be required under applicable regulations. Backup withholding may apply to these payments
if the U.S. Holder fails to certify and provide an accurate taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status. Certain
U.S. Holders are not subject to backup withholding. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors as to their qualification for
exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Non-U.S. Holders generally will be required to
comply with applicable certification procedures to establish that they are not U.S. Holders in order to avoid the application of
information reporting and backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. A holder generally may be entitled to
credit any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules against its U.S. federal income tax liability or to obtain a refund of
the amounts withheld provided the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.

**_FATCA_**

Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code and Treasury regulations thereunder (provisions commonly referred to as “FATCA”) impose a
U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments, including payments of U.S source interest and OID, on obligations that
produce U.S. source interest to “foreign financial institutions” and certain other non-U.S. entities that fail to comply with specified
certification and information reporting requirements. Payments on the New Notes to certain foreign entities could therefore become
subject to the FATCA withholding tax to the extent that payments of interest and OID on the New Notes are treated as paid from
U.S. sources for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply
to their investment in the New Notes. As discussed above under “—Effect of Co-Issuance and Source of Interest Payments,” an
applicable withholding agent likely will treat all payments on the New Notes as U.S.-source for U.S. federal withholding tax
purposes.

**_Foreign Financial Asset Reporting_**

Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information to the IRS with respect to their ownership of “specified foreign financial
assets,” which may include the New Notes, in excess of certain applicable thresholds at any time during the taxable year. U.S.
Holders who fail to report required information could become subject to substantial penalties. Prospective purchasers are
encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these rules on their investment in New Notes.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY LAW CONSIDERATIONS**

**European Union**

The Luxembourg Issuer is incorporated and organized under the laws of a Member State.

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings
(recast), as amended (“Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, to
insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017 the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main
interests” (“COMI”) (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open
main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions).

Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the
administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties” and that in the case of a company or
legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though
that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month
period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be
rebutted: for instance, if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its
registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable
by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests
is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the
COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business
or has its head office.

This means that a company’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a
company has its COMI depends on the facts and circumstances as at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings and
on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views.

If the center of main interests of a company subject to the Recast Insolvency Regulation (a “debtor”), at the time of the request to
open insolvency proceedings, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have
jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and
accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A
to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize (subject to any public
policy exception) the judgment of the court commencing main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the
other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced
there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor’s COMI is situated) which has
jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings may, subject to certain limitations, exercise the powers conferred on it by
the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that
other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (including that the powers are available provided that no
other insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary
has been taken there further to a request for the opening of insolvency proceedings in that other Member State).

If the “COMI” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against
that company if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State, and such insolvency proceedings
must be “secondary” or “territorial” (discussed below). Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex
A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial
proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings.

An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean “any place of operations where a debtor
carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory
economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial
insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in
such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State
(other than Denmark) are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State (other than Denmark).
Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial
insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an

317


-----

establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is
situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is
requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the
territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the
law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency
proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency
proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such
proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction
over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim
of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings
of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of
the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings
and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that the Luxembourg Issuer or one or more Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with
certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such
proceedings. Possible jurisdictions in which insolvency or similar proceedings could be opened include, but are not limited to,
Luxembourg, as the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Luxembourg Issuer, and England and Wales, as the jurisdiction of
incorporation of the Parent Guarantor, and the United States. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and
the security of the Luxembourg Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or one or more of the other Guarantors.

**Luxembourg**

The Luxembourg Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and, in the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings
may be initiated in Luxembourg. The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the
laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that the Luxembourg Issuer
or any future guarantor incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg (a “Luxembourg Guarantor”) experienced financial difficulty,
it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings.

Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the
case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency
proceedings) may be opened against an entity having its center of main interests in Luxembourg or an establishment within the
meaning of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as applicable:

� bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors. Following
such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company: (i) is in a state of cessation
of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a Luxembourg
court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings, ex officio (absent a request made by
the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against
the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the
secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets;

� controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and
not by its creditors and under which a court may order provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement
of claims by secured creditors; and

� composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), which may be requested only by the company (subject to obtaining
the consent of the majority of its creditors representing 75% of the claims outstanding) and not by its creditors directly. The
court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by
creditors, except for secured creditors.

In addition, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on
payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the Issuers into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings
may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in
serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial companies, including the Luxembourg law

318


-----

on commercial companies dated August 5, 1915, as amended, (the “Companies Act 1915”). The management of such liquidation
proceedings will generally follow the rules of Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings.

Liability of the Issuers or any Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the entity following
bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of
such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under
Luxembourg law include, among others:

� certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Inland Revenue (Administration des contributions directes);

� value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Registration, Estates and VAT Department (Administration _de_
_l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA);_

� social security contributions; and

� remuneration owed to employees.

Pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, all collateral arrangements in respect of assets over which the
Luxembourg security interests have been granted, as well as all enforcement events and valuation and enforcement measures
agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable against third parties, commissioners, receivers,
liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings.

During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of certain
secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management
proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by the
Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by
the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the
relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect.

Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence
of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings.

Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the relevant Luxembourg company
during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “suspect period” (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months (and ten
days, depending on the transaction in question) preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific
situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date; if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another
insolvency bankruptcy judgment under Luxembourg law, the court may set the maximum up to six months prior to the filing for
such preceding insolvency bankruptcy proceeding. In particular:

� pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in
particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether
payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have
fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially
inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared
null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver;

� pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions
concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by
the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments;

� in the case of bankruptcy, article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil Code (action
_paulienne) give the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and_
transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit.

The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by the guarantee issued by the Luxembourg
Issuer or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by the Luxembourg Issuer. If they are challenged
successfully, the guarantee issued and the security interests granted by the Luxembourg Issuer may become unenforceable and
any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate.

Pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, notwithstanding the suspect period as referred to in articles 445 and
446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of
liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such

319


-----

arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if
the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been
taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it.

The Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book 1, Title
VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or foreign provisions governing reorganization measures,
winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments or other measures referred to in article 19(b) of the
Luxembourg Collateral Law are not applicable to financial collateral arrangements (such as Luxembourg pledges over shares,
accounts or receivables) and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their
obligations. Certain preferred creditors of a Luxembourg company (including the Luxembourg tax, social security and other
authorities) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the rights of the secured or unsecured creditors.

Article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that all Luxembourg law collateral arrangements (pledges, security
assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral
Law, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance
with this law, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the hardening period against third parties, commissioners,
receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud).

Article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted
by a Luxembourg company will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg
insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope
of the Luxembourg Collateral Law and even if entered into during the hardening period (save in case of fraud).

In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for
_intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts,_
therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. As of
the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate.

Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s business and assets
and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Issuers or Luxembourg Guarantor, as applicable).

Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to
the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as applicable.

**England and Wales**

Certain of the Notes Guarantors and providers of Collateral are companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the
“English Obligors”). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings by or against the English Obligors would likely be based on English
insolvency laws. However, pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20,
2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017), (the “Recast
**Insolvency Regulation”), and, where a company incorporated under English law has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) in a**
Member State, any main insolvency proceedings for that company could, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the Member
State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18 of the Recast Insolvency
Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State.

Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border
Insolvency in England and Wales, provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its COMI in
such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries
out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). As such, should any English Obligor have its
COMI in a country other than the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the
English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be foreign non-main proceedings and would be limited to
the assets that the relevant company has in the UK. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent
to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see “Liquidation/winding-up”), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action
in the UK, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor's assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the
automatic stay will not affect a creditor's rights to enforce security interests over the Collateral (albeit such a stay may be requested
from the English court)). No automatic stay applies in relation to foreign non-main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested
from the English court).

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and
Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI
in the UK or which has its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. While this allows

320


-----

English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of
such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant
other jurisdictions.

**_Recognition in the EU_**

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on 31
December 2020, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in a Member States. As the trade
and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the automatic recognition of
UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies
involving the UK and one or more a Member States will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity.

As a result, unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK
restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in a Member State and for UK office holders to effectively deal with
assets located in a Member States than it was during and prior to the Transition Period. The general position outlined above will
apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant a Member State and the need may
well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment
of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such
appointment will be recognized in other a Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit
of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different
from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU or during the Transition Period.
It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognized and whether investors may be
adversely affected as a result.

**_English insolvency laws_**

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In
the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency
or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security
interests over certain collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the security interests
over the collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the enforceability of any Guarantees granted which are
governed by English law.

Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the
company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying
floating charge” (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a
petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation).

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Notes
Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability
to enforce their rights under the Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and
therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any English Obligor.

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency Act”) has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but instead relies on the concept
of a company's 'inability to pay its debts' as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency Act,
the circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if it fails to satisfy
a creditor's statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or if it fails to satisfy in full or in part a judgment
debt (or similar court order); (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall
due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities,
taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**_Administration_**

321


-----

The Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 empower British courts to make an administration
order in respect of, amongst others, (i) a company registered under the Companies Act 2006 in England and Wales or Scotland,
(ii) a company incorporated in a member state of the European Economic Area, (iii) a company not incorporated in a member state
of the European Economic Area but having its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) or in the UK, (iv) a company
with its COMI in the UK and (v) a company with its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) where there is an
establishment in the UK. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court
is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (although this requirement does not apply
if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”) and that the administration order is
reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. In addition, an eligible company, the directors of such company or the
holder of a qualifying floating charge (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may
also appoint an administrator out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act.

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as
a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would
be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in liquidation) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable,
and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one
or more secured or preferential creditors. An administrator must attempt to achieve the first objective of administration, unless they
think either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the first objective, or that the second objective would achieve a better
result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless they think that it is not
reasonably practicable to achieve either the first objective or the second objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the
interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective.

Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory moratorium
imposed under the Insolvency Act. For example, upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce
security over the company's property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same
requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings,
execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary
factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above.

Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Collateral could not be enforced against that
company, and neither the Trustee nor the holder of the Notes could institute or continue legal proceedings against the relevant
English Obligor(s) in respect of the Notes or the Notes Guarantee or otherwise (although a demand could be issued in respect of
the Notes and/or the Notes Guarantees), while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the
administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain this permission of
the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the board of directors of the English Obligors (save those that do not
interfere with the exercise of that administrators' powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended, and an
administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose
of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge – however an administrator may only
dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the leave of the court or with the consent of the secured creditor).
The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent transactions. A secured creditor cannot appoint an
administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions
to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act), the holder of
a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver.

However, while the restrictions of the moratorium are extensive they are not total. For example, contractual set-off rights may
continue to be exercised, at least until the administrator makes an authorized distribution, and certain creditors of a company
in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to enforce their security over certain of that company’s property
notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security
interest created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (generally, this can include a charge over cash or
financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral
**Regulations”).** A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial
collateral (including a floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral
provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons.

322


-----

Ordinary corporate administration terminates automatically after a year (albeit the administration may be extended by court order
or, subject to a limit of one year, by consent of the creditors). The English Obligor(s) may exit administration if the administrator is
satisfied that one or more of the statutory objectives have been achieved (upon application to and order of the court if the
administration is pursuant to an administration order) and may resume normal business upon exiting administration. However, the
administrator also has the power, should they conclude that there is no reasonable prospect of rescuing the company, to either
place the company into liquidation or use his powers under, and in accordance with, the Insolvency Act to distribute the company’s
assets and thereby achieve substantially the same result as a liquidation.

**_Administrative receivership and Receivership_**

There are, broadly speaking, two different types of receiver: An ‘administrative receiver’ (being a receiver or manager of the whole
or substantially the whole of a company’s property appointed by a holder of a charge which as created was a floating charge, or
by such a charge and one or more other securities and who normally takes over the running of the company’s business) and a
receiver (often described as a “fixed charge receiver”). The latter are not administrative receivers and are mostly used to sell land
or other specific assets subject to a fixed charge.

If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”) to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver provided the qualifying floating charge pre-dates
September 15, 2003 or falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of
administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the
exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act), which may
apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a "capital market investment" (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and
is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its
directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed
the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was
appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator
is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company's property must resign if required
to do so by the administrator.

The ability to appoint a receiver over secured assets (in contrast to an administrative receiver) is typically provided for in English
law security documents. There is also a (limited) statutory right under section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925 for the holder
of a mortgage or charge created by deed over the assets of a chargor to appoint a receiver over the charged assets to collect the
income of the charged property and apply it in satisfaction of the secured debt.

A receiver can be appointed in accordance with the terms of the security documentation which typically provide for the ability to
appoint a receiver once the relevant security interests become enforceable in accordance with their terms. Once appointed, the
receiver acts as the agent of the chargor. The charge document pursuant to which the receiver is appointed will typically set out
the powers of the receiver once appointed. Typically, these powers will include the right to take possession of and sell the charged
assets, with the proceeds being used to pay the secured creditors.

An administrative receiver’s and, typically, a receiver’s primary duty is to realize the secured assets and to pay the proceeds to the
secured creditor, up to the amount of the secured debt (subject to the requirement to set aside the prescribed part (see “Priority
_on insolvency”)). He does, however, also owe duties to the company, in particular a duty to obtain the best price reasonably_
obtainable at the relevant time when selling any asset.

There is no moratorium in receivership or administrative receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are consistent with
the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting goods that are subject to valid retention of
title claims and terminating contracts. If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the
appointment of a receiver or administrative receiver unless (in the case of a receiver) the administrator consents or the court
permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies (see above).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its
directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed
the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was

323


-----

appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. In contrast the
appointment of a receiver who is not an administrative receiver does not prevent the appointment of an administrator.

If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver appointed over part of the company’s
property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge created or
otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realized and distributed by the liquidator
to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act. Once the liquidator has
completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of
the company's members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary
liquidation (“CVL”). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts
(as described above) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up.

Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales, with their COMI in a
Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales or which have a “sufficient connection” with
England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies
registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England
and Wales or in a Member State (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’
voluntary liquidation).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory windingup, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company's property made after the commencement of
the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to
a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations
and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an
order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of
the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company and its
property will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company or its property without permission
of the court.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the
winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the
Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the
liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay
being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security.

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution
to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the
winding-up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into
the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL
process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In
contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can
be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors' choice
will prevail.

A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the
business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company's property and execute
documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions.

324


-----

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and
any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other
onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on
the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations
have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities, and if a contract is disclaimed the contractual
counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect of the terminated contract. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous
property does not apply where the collateral-provider or collateral-taker under the arrangement is being wound up, to any financial
collateral arrangement.

**_Company Voluntary Arrangements_**

A company voluntary arrangement (“CVA”) is a procedure intended to allow companies to avoid potentially terminal insolvency
proceedings and to address their financial difficulties by obtaining a binding agreement or compromise with their unsecured
creditors. Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency
practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. CVAs may
also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between
the debtor company and its creditors.

A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding legislation) in England
and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a Member State or (iii) if the company is not incorporated in a Member State but
has its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) or in the UK. The CVA can be proposed by the relevant company’s directors
(if the relevant company is not in administration or liquidation) or, if the relevant company is in administration or liquidation, by the
administrator or the liquidator (as applicable).

The proposal for a CVA would generally include a rescheduling or reduction of the company's unsecured debts, but may also form
part of more complex arrangements that seek to balance the interests of many different creditor groups.

If the proposals under the CVA are approved by the requisite majority of creditors (i.e. a majority in excess of 75% in value of
creditors who respond in the decision procedure) and provided that those voting against the proposal do not include more than
50% in value of creditors who are unconnected with the company whose claims are admitted for voting, a CVA will bind all
unsecured creditors of a company who were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been entitled to vote if they had
notice of the decision procedure - however a CVA will not affect the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors unless they
agree to the proposals. Shareholders of the company will also be asked to vote on the CVA but whether or not they vote in favor,
the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority of creditors approve the proposal.

**_Challenges to guarantees and security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company of security and guarantees
can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the English company is placed into administration or liquidation within a
specified period of the granting of the guarantee or security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator
is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by
such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency is within any of
the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be
challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern, one of the possible
functions of administration) under English law is to realize the assets of the company in question and distribute the proceeds from
those assets to the company's creditors.

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the
proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With
the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the
claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within
a class.

325


-----

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

� First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that
indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial
ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest;

� Second ranking: If the company has gone into administration, or proceedings for the winding up of the company have
begun, in each case within 12 weeks of the end of a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act (see “Moratorium”
below): (i) debts falling due or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it; and (ii) certain “priority
pre-moratorium debts” (see “Moratorium” below);

� Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which
expenses are paid);

� Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

o Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to:
(i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work
done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due
to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the
insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services
Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit.

o Secondary preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS
to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (ii) VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC as
set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after
the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank
equally;

� Fifth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating
charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was
rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the
Prescribed Part must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

� Sixth ranking:

o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of
the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including
accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency
proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place
between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can
only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the
Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors;

o secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and
the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of
any administration which preceded such liquidation. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due
under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are
sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and

o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore
are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and

� Seventh ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these
will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

326


-----

Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provide
that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act).

An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g., an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to
ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors
(after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”).
Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the company's net property and 20% of the remainder of
the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property
is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum
aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would
be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured
creditors unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to first pay out all unsecured creditors.

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts, any debt of a company
payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into pound sterling at the “official exchange rate” prevailing at
the date when the company went into liquidation or administration (if the liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration,
on the date the company went into administration). This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The “official
exchange rate” for these purposes is the middle exchange rate on the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of business, as
published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court determines. If a creditor considers the
rate to be unreasonable, they may apply to the court.

**_Qualifying Floating Charges_**

In order for a floating charge to constitute a qualifying floating charge, it must be created by an instrument which: (a) states that
the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c)
purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by section 29(2) of the Insolvency
Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if they hold one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a
qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; (b) by a number of
qualifying floating charges which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property; or (c) by charges
and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company’s property and at least
one of which is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that it is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates
to ‘the whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage of
a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Security over assets (including shares)_**

Security (other than by way of a legal mortgage) over assets (including shares of an English Company) granted by an English
Obligor or over assets of the English Obligor are, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge
arises where a chargor creates an encumbrance over the property in favor of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest
in the property to the chargee but retains legal title to the property. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to
equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English Obligor, the banks with which
some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may hold a right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a
crystallization event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their
cash pooling or other arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a
floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s
rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the
floating charge has crystallized and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain
insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the
collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank's netting and set-off rights.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

327


-----

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006, which permits a company to
enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors (or any class of them).

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise or arrangement with respect
to a company’s creditors or members (or any class of them) where such company is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency
Act.

In practice, a company incorporated in England will satisfy this test. A company incorporated outside of England will satisfy this
test if it has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction, which requirement has been found to be satisfied where, amongst
other things, the company’s “centre of main interests” is in England, the company's finance documents are English law governed
and contains a jurisdiction clause in respect of the English courts, or the company's finance documents have been amended in
accordance with their terms to be governed by English law and to include a jurisdiction clause in respect of the English courts.
Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors (or members) will vote on the proposed
compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such
creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. The
compromise or arrangement can be proposed by the company or its creditors, but in practice it is almost always a company-led
process.

To proceed to the sanction hearing, the scheme must be approved by a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of
those persons present and voting at the meeting(s), in person or by proxy, of each class of creditors (or members), irrespective of
the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents. If approved by the requisite majorities at the scheme
meeting(s), the scheme must then be considered by the court again at the sanction hearing, where the court will exercise its
discretion to decide whether to sanction the scheme, which generally involves it considering all statutory and procedural
requirements have been fulfilled and the overall fairness of the scheme. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the
scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. Once sanctioned by the
court, the scheme will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and
those who voted against the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger a moratorium of claims or
proceedings although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “Moratorium”) to provide protection pending the sanction of the
scheme if the relevant company is eligible.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than
insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and
the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 where these apply. In
addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA 2020”) enacted fundamental reforms to the United
Kingdom’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were
fast-tracked through the United Kingdom legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include the
following:

_Moratorium_

Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit certain distressed
companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue
and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a ‘debtor-in-possession’ process, meaning that a company in a moratorium remains
under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a ‘monitor’. Despite
the existence of a “payment holiday” in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which exists throughout the moratorium, the
company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force under an obligation incurred before

328


-----

the moratorium commenced (known as “priority pre-moratorium debts”), including the costs of goods and services, employees and
rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts.

The initial duration of the moratorium is 20 business days, beginning on the business day after the day on which the moratorium
comes into force and is extendable for (i) a further 20 business days by the directors, (ii),up to a year with creditor consent (including
the initial 20 business day period), and up to any date set by the court in its discretion following an application by the directors of
the company.

Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a number of exclusions from
eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets arrangements where the debt incurred (or, when entering
into the agreement, expected to be incurred) was at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement)
and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, amongst other things, secured and unsecured
debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial
paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors.

_Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_

CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses and the imposition of amended
terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the counterparty company being
made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such procedures include winding-up and administration, as well as the new
moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than on the counterparty being subject
to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency
proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or
if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship.
Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition.

_Restructuring plan_

CIGA 2020 introduced a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006 (see
“England and Wales—Scheme of arrangement”), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders
to the restructuring plan proposed. The restructuring plan under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 is available to any company
that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of State is given the express power to exclude regulated
companies providing financial services from being able to propose a restructuring plan, and may also provide for other exclusions
as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may be party to a restructuring plan.

A restructuring plan is available to a company where two conditions are met. The first condition is that the company has
encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as
a going concern. The second condition is that a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the company and its creditors
or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such
financial difficulties. There is no other financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies
(in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). Where a convening application is made
within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see “Moratorium”), any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts”
and “priority pre-moratorium debts” (see “Moratorium”) may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the
restructuring plan without their consent.

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as
part of the proponent's application to convene a meeting of creditors or members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine
the classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan. Once the court is
satisfied it has jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors/members to vote on
the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by a
statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material interests of the directors of the company and the effect on those
interests of the plan insofar as it is different from the effects on the like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose
rights would be affected by the restructuring plan must be permitted to participate in a class meeting ordered by the court, provided
that this will not apply in relation to a class of creditors or members of the company if, up on application, the court is satisfied that
none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company.

At the relevant class meeting(s), the restructuring plan will be approved if a number representing at least 75% in value of the
creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members (as applicable) present and voting vote in favor of it. In contrast to

329


-----

a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the restructuring plan.
Following the class meeting(s), a restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although there are
no provisions which expressly set out how the court’s discretion is to be exercised, the court will draw on the principles applicable
to schemes. For example, the court may refuse to grant sanction if it considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable.

As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme or arrangement does not have, a “cross-class cram
down” provision. This grants the court a discretion to sanction a restructuring plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or
members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that none of the
members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the restructuring plan than they would be in the event of the
“relevant alternative” (i.e. whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring
plan were not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing at least 75% in value of a
class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting, who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic
interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative referred to in (i) above.

As with schemes of arrangement, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a restructuring plan where such company is liable
to be wound up under the Insolvency Act, which (as with schemes) includes where a non-English company has “sufficient
connection” to the English jurisdiction.

A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not,
and will be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the
Registrar of Companies.

Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the restructuring plan and any previous rights
will be extinguished.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or
proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “Moratorium”) to provide protection pending the sanction of the
plan if the relevant company is eligible.

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to
be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in
civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin
to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties.

_Temporary measures_

In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, legislation was introduced to restrict temporarily the ability of creditors to present winding- up
petitions and of courts to grant winding- up orders. With effect from October 1, 2021, those restrictions expired and were replaced
by the Schedule 10 Regulations, a set of new more limited regulations introducing temporary targeted measures to limit the use of
winding- up petitions in certain circumstances but not prevent their general use.

The Schedule 10 Regulations provide that a winding- up petition may not be presented by a creditor on the grounds that a company
is unable to pay its debts unless certain conditions are met. The principal consequence of those conditions is that, between October
1, 2021 and March 31, 2022 (subject to change):

� a creditor may not present a winding up petition on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts in respect of
an excluded debt, being a debt in respect of any sum payable by a tenant under a business tenancy that is unpaid by
reason of a financial effect of coronavirus. In addition, the debt must be for a liquidated amount that is due for payment;

� a creditor may not present a winding up petition on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts in respect of a
debt or (where the petition relates to two or more debts) debts totaling less than £10,000; and

� a creditor may not present a winding up petition on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts unless the
creditor has delivered written notice to the debtor stating that the creditor is seeking the debtor’s proposals for the
payment of the debt and that if the debtor has not made a proposal that is to the creditor’s satisfaction within 21 days
beginning with the day the notice was delivered, the creditor intends to present a winding- up petition.

330


-----

The court has the power to waive the requirement for creditors to serve a formal request seeking proposals for payment of the debt
or to shorten the period within which such proposals are to be submitted.

_So-called “Henry VIII” powers_

CIGA 2020 further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate
insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify
the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure
applies, or to change or disapply a person's corporate duties and liabilities

331


-----

**CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE**
**COLLATERAL**

The Notes Guarantees and security interests in the Collateral may be subject to certain financial assistance and insolvency
limitations under U.S. law, Luxembourg law and English law, as further described below.

**U.S. Law Limitations**

_Fraudulent transfer_

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws, the transfer
of an interest in property or the incurrence of an obligation, including the incurrence of the obligations under the Notes, the issuance
of the Notes Guarantees and the grant of security, whether now or in the future, by the Issuers and the Guarantors (together, the
“Obligors”) could be avoided, if, among other things, at the time the Obligors made such transfer or incurred such obligation, the
Obligors (i) intended to hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditor or (ii) received less than reasonably equivalent value
or fair consideration for the transfer or obligation and:

� were insolvent on the date the transfer was made or obligation incurred or were rendered insolvent by the transfer or obligation;

� were engaged in a business or transaction or about to be engaged in a business or transaction for which the Obligors’
remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital; or

� intended to incur, or believed that they would incur, debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as they mature.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code a fraudulent transfer can be challenged for a two-year period under federal law or under a longer
period under applicable state law. In New York state, the challenge would need to be brought within four years of the relevant
transfer or, in case of intentional fraudulent transfers, within the later of (i) four years of the relevant transfer or (ii) one year of when
the transfer was or could reasonably have been discovered.

_Preference_

Any transfer of an interest of the Obligors in property to or for the benefit of the Notes, including payments made on account of the
Notes or the grant of any security interest, whether now or pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the Indentures,
might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy case by the transferor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a
preference if certain events or circumstances exist or occur (subject to certain defenses and exceptions), including, among others,
if the transferor is insolvent at the time of the transfer, a bankruptcy case in respect of the transferor is commenced within 90 days
following the transfer (or in certain circumstances, a longer period) and the transfer permits the holders of the Notes to receive a
greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the transfer had not been
made.

_Other actions_

As a court of equity, a U.S. bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or other claims against us under
the principle of equitable subordination, if the U.S. bankruptcy court determines that: (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type
of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon
the holder of Notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

_The automatic stay_

The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce the Obligors’ payment obligations under the Notes and Notes Guarantees or its security
interests and other rights against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures governing the Notes
is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S. bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors becomes a debtor in a case
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such
as a holder of Notes, is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from, among other things,
commencing or continuing any action or proceeding against the debtor or taking any action to obtain possession of or exercise
control over property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors could
therefore prevent the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession or exercising control over the Collateral or commencing any
action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral or otherwise enforce their rights under the Notes.
The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but parties may object to
any creditor’s request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court may deny such a request.

_Right of debtor-in-possession to remain in control of collateral and the bankruptcy process_

332


-----

An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its property and is
authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession” subject to certain limitations. This remains the case
unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, in which case a chapter 11 trustee or chapter 7 trustee remains in possession of the debtor’s property. Moreover, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral (and, subject to satisfaction of certain legal
requirements, to grant senior liens on such collateral to secure postpetition financing) even though the debtor is in default under
the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s
property. Under certain circumstances, a secured creditor may need to request that a bankruptcy court order the debtor to provide
adequate protection of the secured creditor’s interest. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case
to the extent that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in such collateral decreases during the pendency of the bankruptcy
case as a result of (i) the use, sale or lease of such collateral, (ii) the incurrence of postpetition financing secured by senior or
“priming” liens on the same collateral and/or (iii) the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to
a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not
entitled to any additional adequate protection for a decrease in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the
amount of the debt that it secures by a sufficient margin. Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter
11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or its plan has not been accepted within the first
180 days of the case by each class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan. The bankruptcy court may reduce or
enlarge these periods for cause upon request of a party in interest. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months
after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these
“exclusive periods,” other parties, such as secured creditors, would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their
own chapter 11 plans. In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive
periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict:

� whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests;

� the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or

� whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral
through the requirement of “adequate protection.”

_A debtor-in-possession may obtain new credit secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens_

The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension of new credit
from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and circumstances, authorize the
debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing
liens, provided that, among other things, there is adequate protection of the interests of the holders of the existing liens. In other
words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be
permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing.

_Post-petition interest_

Any future bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors could possibly assert that the fair market value of
the collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the
Notes. Upon a finding by a bankruptcy court that the Notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with
respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be
entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In the event of a U.S. bankruptcy case, the holders of the Notes will be entitled
to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code only to the extent that the value of their security interest in the collateral
is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the
obligation under the Notes equals or exceeds the fair market value of the collateral securing the Notes. Holders of the Notes that
have a security interest in the collateral with a value equal to or less than their pre- bankruptcy claim will generally not be entitled
to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

_Ability to confirm a chapter 11 plan notwithstanding the dissenting votes of creditors_

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can bind a creditor or equityholder (or class of creditors or equityholders) that
does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor
and the property of the bankruptcy estate and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and
interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan and receiving distributions
under the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote
on the plan and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled

333


-----

to vote on the plan and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if creditors holding at least twothirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the claims of such class accept the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the
bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more
impaired classes reject the plan, the plan may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the
“cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which require, among other things, that one impaired class has accepted
the plan and that the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests
that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan over
the objection of one or more dissenting classes.

**Luxembourg Law Limitations**

_Security interest_

According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law
of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection
and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation,
perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered
shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law
and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account
located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc.

If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by
Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral
Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or
deemed to be located in Luxembourg.

Under the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements (the “Collateral Law”), the perfection of security
interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge agreement must be (i)
acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the security interest) and (ii) registered in
the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional
acknowledgement, acceptance and/or registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge over receivables
becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the agreement pursuant to
which the pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been notified
of the pledge or if he did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, he will be validly discharged if he pays the pledgor. A
bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank. In addition, the account bank has to waive
any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, the
perfection of such pledge will require additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations,
notifications and acceptances occur, the pledge agreements are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the account banks
and other third parties.

Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an
enforcement event:

� appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance
with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets;

� sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales),
(ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction;

� court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a
court-appointed expert; or

� set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets.

As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the
valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts,
stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed.

Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets
located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under
Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts,
in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the

334


-----

Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if
“main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the Recast Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such
security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Regulation
applies, and in accordance of article 5 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation.

The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from
seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge
agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors
through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds
of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law).

Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some
of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which
are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency
official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain
assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party.
This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets.

The Luxembourg Issuer and other entities incorporated in Luxembourg have granted or will grant security interests and guarantees
in order to secure, inter alia, the obligations under the notes.

The Companies Act 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness
of another entity of the same group. A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the
company’s corporate purposes, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the company. Whether an action is in the corporate
interest of a company is a matter of fact not a legal issue. The directors/managers of a company are those who are able to assess
whether such company has a corporate benefit and interest in granting cross- or up-stream security interests or guarantees.
Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely
interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in
return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. The
provision of guarantee/security interest for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns,
whereas the provision of crossstream and upstream guarantees/security interests may be more problematic. It cannot ultimately
be excluded that granting of security interest/guarantee, which would be considered by a Luxembourg court as made in the absence
of corporate interest, be declared void on the ground of illegal cause (cause illicite). Following the French supreme court case law,
to which Luxembourg courts might turn, a Luxembourg entity could find a benefit and a corporate interest in granting security
interests and guarantees for the obligations of other group entities if certain conditions are met. It is generally held that within a
group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the
group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee being held enforceable even where
corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily
conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial
means of the assisting company (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux
_propres)), the company must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the_
affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common
objective. As a result, the guarantees/security interests granted by a Luxembourg company may be subject to limitations in order
to ensure their enforceability.

The cross- or up-stream guarantees granted by a Luxembourg company will be subject to contractual limitations.

**English Law Limitations**

**_Connected persons_**

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue,
preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of the company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of
such director or shadow director, or (iv) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner,
(iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A person is also an associate of any person whom
he employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are his
associates together have control of it.

335


-----

A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies, or (ii) it is controlled by a
person and that person’s associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it is controlled by a group of two or more persons
who also control the other company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the
same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of
it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control
the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has
control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the
company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or guarantee granted by an
English company include, without limitation, the following described below.

**_Reviewable Transactions_**

There are five principal provisions of the Insolvency Act under which transactions entered into prior to a company's insolvency are
capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance
of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions
(section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the exception of section
423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.

_Transactions at an undervalue_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court
may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms
that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or
money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii)
the transaction took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency (as described below)); and (iii) the
company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning
of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered
into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were
reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to
restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the
administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction
was a connected person (see “English Law Limitations—Connected persons”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency
and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or
became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether
or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in
property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest
deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value
to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preferences_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application
of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of
the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in
either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent

336


-----

liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced
in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not
been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was
given within the relevant time (six months before the onset of the insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the
transaction is with a Connected Person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the
transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

It is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the time and that the company was
influenced by a desire to prefer the counterparty to the transaction, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected
person (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), in which case there is a presumption that the company
was influenced by a desire to prefer and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such
desire.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company
to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator
to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the
relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a
connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person
in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company
to prefer them.

An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are
the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired
from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest,
and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator
or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when
they were a creditor of the English company.

_Voidable floating charges_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that company over its property may
be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of two
years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of twelve months before the onset of insolvency
when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent
of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or
services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the
charge, the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at the same time as, or after, the
creation of the charge, of any debt of the company, and of the interest on any such amount. No court action is required.

If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to appoint an administrator
out-of-court or through the less onerous in-court route for qualifying floating charge holders or (if the holder would otherwise have
been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held invalid), to appoint an administrative
receiver.

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement
within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was
entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the
company or otherwise prejudicing his interests.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the
claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction
(with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or
administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The
Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered
into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets

337


-----

out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a
substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit
to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the
victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or
not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant
circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a
party to the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transactions_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the
application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require
grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the
credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before
the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the
onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences).

_Orders_

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has very wide statutory
powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.

**_Onset of insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges,
depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b)
the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an
administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary
liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of
insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

**_Recharacterization of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that any of the fixed security interests expressed to be created by the Security
Documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is
not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating
security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the
chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security
holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion
and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating
charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed
security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain,
in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the
relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor's net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing
above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the security agent

338


-----

to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration
would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the chargors in respect of the obligations of another group company must satisfy
certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and
articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee
and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be
obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without
difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of
entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that
he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a
whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing
their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies
Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors
of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors' duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has
recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to
become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.”

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would
result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to UK company law.

Under UK company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and
Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security)
may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security
interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created
on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable
charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be
secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the
English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has
expired.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to be entered into in connection
with the New Notes, the Issuers have agreed to sell the New Notes to the Initial Purchasers and the Initial Purchasers have agreed,
severally and not jointly, to purchase the New Notes from the Issuers.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all the New
Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the New Notes which it has agreed
to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased
up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the New Notes
are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the New Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof. After the initial
offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the New Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers
without notice. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion
of the Notes for their own accounts. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and
to reject orders in whole or in part.

We have agreed to provide the Initial Purchasers certain customary fees or discounts for their services in connection with the
offering of the New Notes and to reimburse them for certain out-of-pocket expenses.

Persons who purchase New Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other charges in
accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement will provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities,
including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial Purchasers may be required to
make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, issue or otherwise
dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities of, or guaranteed by, the Company during the
period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date that is 30 days after the date of the Purchase
Agreement.

The New Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the New Notes: (i) in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers”
within the meaning of Rule 144A; and (ii) outside the United States in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S. Until
40 days after the commencement of the offering of the New Notes, an offer or sale of New Notes within the United States by a
broker-dealer (whether or not it is participating in the offering of the New Notes) may violate the registration requirements of the
U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than pursuant to Rule 144A. Resales of the New Notes are restricted
as described under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

� it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated any
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any New Notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to
us, and

� it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the
New Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell
or otherwise make available any New Notes in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom to retail investors, each defined
as a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point
(10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus
Regulation (as applicable).

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the New
Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such New Notes to
eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation

340


-----

to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking
its own target market assessment in respect of such New Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the New Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or
any other material relating to us or the New Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the
New Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material
or advertisements in connection with the New Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except
in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not
constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any
restrictions relating to the offering of the New Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the New Notes.
See “Transfer Restrictions.”

The Issuers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or
indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption
afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable
to the offer and sale of the New Notes.

The New Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We will apply for the New Notes to be listed
on the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the New Notes will be approved for listing or that such
listing will be obtained, or if obtained, will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market
for the New Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the offering of the New Notes. The Initial Purchasers are not
obligated, however, to make a market in the New Notes, and any market-making activity may be discontinued at any time at the
sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits
imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. We cannot assure you that any market for the New Notes will
develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any New Notes at a particular time or at a price which
will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—There may not be an active trading
_market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

We expect that delivery of the New Notes will be made against payment on the New Notes on or around the date specified on the
cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be business days (as such term is used for purposes of Rule
15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the New Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+
”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two
business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the New
Notes more than two business days prior to the settlement date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the New Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time
of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Such purchasers should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the offering of the New Notes, the Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in
transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the New Notes. Specifically, the Stabilization Manager, or
persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the New Notes. The
Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the offering of the New Notes, creating a syndicate short
position, and may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the
Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase New Notes in market-making transactions as
permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective
market price of the New Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage
in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the New Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Structure—There may not be an active
_trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes may be limited.”_

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may
include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment,
hedging, financing and brokerage activities. UBS Securities LLC or its affiliates are lenders under credit facilities entered into by
Acuris Finance S.à.r.l, Acuris Finance US, Inc. and I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited as borrowers and other financing
arrangements to affiliates of the ION Group.

-----

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time
have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services
to us and our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and
commissions, including in connection with the Offering. In connection with our strategy to review and evaluate selective acquisitions
and other business combinations, we and our shareholders regularly engage mergers and acquisition advisors and other financial
advisors to assist us. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may be currently advising us or other interested parties,
and the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may advise us or other interested parties from time to time on other transactions in
the future. The Initial Purchasers may also, from time to time, hold bonds or loans of, or acquire equity positions in the Issuers or
their subsidiaries and affiliates in normal course, including allocations of the New Notes and the Existing Credit Facility. The Initial
Purchasers and their affiliates may, from time to time, engage in transactions with, and perform services for, the Issuers, their
subsidiaries and affiliates in the ordinary course of their business.

In addition, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates are or may be in the future party to certain of our hedging arrangements
and other financing and/or debt arrangements and may hold other proprietary positions in us, our current or future subsidiaries and
affiliates and/or financial intermediaries and the financial instruments issued by any of them. Finally, if the Initial Purchasers or
their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuer or its affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely
hedge, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates
consistent with their customary risk management policies.

_transfer of the New Notes offered hereby._

**General**

The New Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction, and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a

We have not registered and will not register the New Notes or the Notes Guarantees under the Securities Act and, therefore, the

Purchasers for re-offer and resale only:

� in the United States to “qualified institutional buyers,” commonly referred to as “QIBs,” as defined in Rule 144A under the
Securities Act in compliance with Rule 144A; and

� outside the United States in an offshore transaction in accordance with Regulation S (and, in this case, only to investors who,
if resident in a member state of the EEA or the United Kingdom, are not retail investors, each defined as a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the
Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation or the UK Prospectus Regulation
(as applicable)).

We use the terms “offshore transaction,” and “United States” with the meanings given to them in Regulation S under the Securities
Act.

**SELECTED EXPLANATORY NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM**
**FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

1. GENERAL INFORMATION, BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES

_(a)_ _General information_
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of I-Logic Technologies Bidco
Limited (“the Company”) and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) for the nine months ended 30
September 2021 were authorised for issue on __ January 2022.

The Company is a private company limited by shares which was incorporated on 14
November 2017 in England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street
Place, 2[nd] Floor, London, EC4R 1BE, United Kingdom. The Group develop and market
content, data, analytics and software solutions to corporates and financial institutions. The
Company’s immediate parent undertaking is I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, company
incorporated in England and Wales while its ultimate parent undertaking and controlling
party is Bessel Capital S.àr.l., a company incorporated in Luxembourg.

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation_
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the nine months
ended 30 September 2021 have been prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standards (IAS) 34 Interim Financial Reporting.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the
information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read
in conjunction with the 2020 annual consolidated financial statements of the Group. As
further detailed in note 1(c), these financial statements are prepared based on predecessor
accounting and should be read in conjunction with the 2020 annual consolidated financial
statements of the Group. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements are
presented in US dollars. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except
where otherwise indicated.

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_

On 16 February 2021, as part of a group reorganisation, the Company acquired the shares
of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris
International Limited, through a series of share-for-share exchanges. This reorganisation is
a common control transaction. In preparing the condensed consolidated interim financial
statements of the Company we have reflected the results of the Group including the
transferred companies, from the first date that the companies came under common control,
and not from the date the Company beneficially owned the shares. On consolidation, the
assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognised at the book values of the
transferred companies and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of
the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the acquired
entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of the subsidiary is taken to other
reserves.

_(d)_ _Accounting policies_
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the Group’s
annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2020, except for
the accounting for investment in associate and adoption of new standards effective as at 1
January 2021.

_Investments in associates_
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence. Significant
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the
investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. The Group’s investment in an
associate is accounted for using the equity method.

The condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income reflects the
Group’s share in the results of operations of the associates. Where there has been a
change recognised in the investees’ other comprehensive income, the Group recognises
its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in other comprehensive
income. Profits and losses arising from transactions between the Group and the associate
are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates.

The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the
Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with
those of the Group.

13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities, the carrying amounts are
reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of
cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other
current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities
of these instruments.

Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings, except for
the bonds issued by the Group in May 2021, are determined to approximate their carrying
amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no
change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings. The fair value of the
bonds issued by the Group amounted to $347.4 million as at September 2021 determined
based on the Level 1 input (Quoted market price).

14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

During the reporting period, the Group transacted with related parties in the ION Investment
Group Limited and subsidiaries (ION Group) in the normal course of business. Please refer
to Note 8 and Note 11 for balances outstanding as at 30 September 2021 and 31 December
2019. For the nine months ended 30 September 2021, sales to these group entities
amounted to $8.0 million (30 September 2020: $8.2 million) and purchases from these
group entities amounted to $20.2 million (30 September 2020: $19.3 million).

15. SEASONALITY

Management assessed that the Group’s business is not subject to seasonality, as the
Group’s revenue is significantly derived from subscription services which are recognised
rateably over the contract period.

16. OTHER INFORMATION

_GOING CONCERN_
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12 months
from the date of approval of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the
'period of assessment').

The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value,
together with the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, business
performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19
outbreak. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the Group’s operations, since a significant
portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multi-year contracts with customers with the
services provided being critical to our customer’s operations and these services can be
performed remotely by the Group.

The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a severe but
plausible downside case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including
cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities. As a result of this review, the directors
have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group is a going concern,
having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future
and have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the
approval of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

_COMMITMENTS_
There is a charge over the assets of the Group and over those of certain subsidiary
undertakings in favour of UBS AG, Stamford Branch, in its role as Collateral Agent.

17. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE

In December 2021, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Backstop Solutions Group
LLC and subsidiaries, a US based productivity suite provider. The total purchase
consideration for the acquisition is $257.0 million. The initial accounting for the business
combination is incomplete as at the date of issue of these condensed consolidated interim
financial statements.

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020**

The directors present herewith their Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and audited consolidated financial
statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the financial year ended 31 December
2020.

_PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS_

I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) develop and market
content, data, analytics and software solutions to participants of the global capital markets. The Group generates
revenue from data and product licences and from professional services. The Group will continue to sell and develop
market content and software solutions.

_Financial Performance Indicators_

The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation), Profit after Taxation, Net Cashflow and Net Debt.

_Revenue_

The Group’s total revenue was $211.4 million in 2020 and $184.6 million in 2019. The increase in total revenue for
2020 as compared to 2019 was $26.8 million or 14.5 %.

_EBITDA_

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation were $87.1 million in 2020 and $101.8 million in
2019. The decrease in EBITDA for 2020 as compared to 2019 is $14.7 million or 14.4%.

_Loss after Taxation_

Loss after taxation, including a $64.8 million charge relating to the amortisation of intangible assets ($66.0 million
in 2019), was $4.7 million in 2020 compared to a loss after taxation of $3.9 million in 2019. The increase in loss
after taxation for 2020 as compared to 2019 is $0.8 million or 20.5%.

_Net Cashflow and Net Debt_

The Group’s cash balance decreased by $1.5 million in 2020 compared to a decrease of $7.9 million in 2019. Net
debt at the end of 2020 was $584.9 million compared to $577.6 million at the end of 2019 due to significant
weakening of USD against EUR in 2020. See the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for further details on the
movements in cash.

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_

The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are:

     - The Group currently derives most of its revenue from a limited number of products. As a result, a
reduction in demand for, or sales of, these products would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and operating results;

     - The Group derives the majority of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The
Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant
changes in that industry;

     - The Group depends on large transactions from a limited number of customers for a significant portion of
its revenue and the delay or loss of any large customer could adversely affect the Group’s business,
financial condition and operating results;

     - Potential defects in the Group’s products or failure to provide services for the Group’s customers could
cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s
reputation;

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (Continued)_

     - The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could obtain and use
the Group’s technology without authorisation;

    - The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property or proprietary
rights of others;

    - The Group has historically grown organically and through the acquisition of, and investment in, other
companies, product lines and technologies. There can be no guarantees that future acquisitions can be
successfully assimilated or that projected growth in revenues or synergies in operating costs can be
achieved. Additionally, even during a successful integration, the investment of management’s time and
resources in the new enterprise may be detrimental to the consolidation and growth of the Group’s
existing business;

    - The Group has funded its activities through the issue of shares operating cash flows and bank
borrowings. The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales
revenues will fund its existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital
requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group
may need to find additional financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s
use of financial instruments is discussed in note 15.

The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks and uncertainties.
The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and proactively limit the associated risks.

_SECTION 172 STATEMENT_

The directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider,
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members and key
stakeholders. The directors when making key decisions for the Company have had considered the impact of their
decisions to the Company’s key stakeholders and to wider society by continuing to facilitate the critical processes
within our customer’s businesses, and by focusing on innovation in the capital markets in order to contribute to
continuous process improvement for our customers.

One of Dealogic’s core values is to long term thinking and building long-term sustainable relationships with our
customers. Dealogic software helps our customers to improve decision-making, increase efficiency, simplify
complex processes and empower their people. This is achieved by partnering with our customers to enable them to

place to keep employees up to date on recent developments of company and allow employee engagement with
senior management, through face to face meetings and electronic media.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020**

The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements (“financial
statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2020.

_DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_

The names of the directors who served at any time during the financial year are as listed on page F-5.

The interests of the directors and company secretary who served at any time during the financial year in shares of
the Company or other Group companies are set out in note 23 to the financial statements.

_DIVIDENDS_

In 2020, a dividend of $1.7 million was declared and paid (2019: $6.2 million).

_EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_

On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt facilities. I-logic Technologies Bidco
Limited acquired the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc.; collectively
referred to as “Acuris”. The acquisition of the three Acuris companies was a common control transaction which
was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange.

Concurrent with the group reorganisation, the newly combined group refinanced the existing debt facilities of both
Acuris and the Group by drawing down a new debt facility to repay its existing debt facilities and extended the
maturity of both USD and Euro facilities to 16 February 2028.

_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_

Research and development is concentrated on the development of software solutions for the participants of the
global capital markets. The capitalised development costs are shown in note 10. All other development costs are
expensed as incurred.

_GOING CONCERN_

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The time
period that the directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis of
accounting is a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the ‘period of
assessment’).

The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value, together with the main
trends and factors likely to affect future development, business performance and position of the Group; including
the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the
Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multi-year contracts with
customers with the services provided being critical to our customer’s operations and these services can be
performed remotely by the Group.

The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a severe but plausible downside case,
and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing
facilities (see note 15 for details on the loans and note 25 for details on the post year end refinancing). As a result
of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group and the Company
is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and
have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.

**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (Continued)**

_DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT_

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the Group and Company
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law, the directors have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and applicable
law, and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards
and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 101
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their profit or loss for that year. In
preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:

     - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

     - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;

     - for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with
international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and
applicable law;

     - for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, including
FRS 101, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements;

     - assess the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concerns; and

     - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.

_GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS, ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY_

address health, safety and economic issues. The Company has complied with all applicable legislation and
regulations.

_DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR_

So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information, being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing their report, of which the auditor
is unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow directors and the Company’s auditor, each director has taken all the
steps that he is obliged to take as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

_AUDITOR_

KPMG LLP, Chartered Accountants, were appointed as auditor and have signified their willingness to continue in
office in accordance with section 487 of the Companies Act 2006.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited (“the company”) for the year ended
31 December 2020 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated and
company statement of financial position, consolidated and company statement of changes in equity, consolidated
cash flow statement and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.

In our opinion:

     - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

     - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international accounting
standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006

     - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting
standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

     - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are
independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**Going concern**

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate
the group or the company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group and the
company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material
uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a
year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).

In our evaluation of the directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the group’s business model and
analysed how those risks might affect the group and company’s financial resources or ability to continue operations
over the going concern period.

Our conclusions based on this work:

     - we consider that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate;

     - we have not identified, and concur with the directors’ assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty
related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group or
the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes
that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are
not a guarantee that the group or the company will continue in operation.

**_Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations — ability to detect_**

_Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud_

To identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud (“fraud risks”) we assessed events or conditions that could
indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment
procedures included:

     - Enquiring of directors and legal department and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group’s
high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud and the Group’s channel for
“whistleblowing”, as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud.

     - Considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets.

     - Using analytical procedures to identify any usual or unexpected relationships.

_Continued…/_

F 26


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED (Continued)**

As required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform
procedures to address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition,
in particular that revenue is recorded in the wrong period.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks.

We performed procedures including:

     - Identifying journal entries and other adjustments to test based on risk criteria and comparing the
identified entries to supporting documentation. These included testing journals that were debits to
revenue or credit to revenue with unexpected debit entries.

_Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations_

We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the
financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience through discussion with the directors and
other management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors and other management
the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.

We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of
non-compliance throughout the audit.

The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.

Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial
reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation
legislation, and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on
the related financial statement items.

Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance
could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the
imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: GDPR
compliance, anti-bribery, and employment law recognising the cross-geographical nature of the Group’s activities.
Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations
to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any.
Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an
audit will not detect that breach.

_Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation_

Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some
material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit
in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations
is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited
procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.

In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve
collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit
procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or
fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.

**Strategic report and directors’ report**

The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider whether, based
on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the
financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

     - we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;

     - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

     - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED (Continued)**

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

     - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

     - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
or

     - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

     - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page F-9, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at
www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

_(a)_ _General information_

The consolidated financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 11 April
2021. I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited is a private company limited by shares which was incorporated in
England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, 2[nd ] Floor, London, EC4R 1BE,
United Kingdom The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Strategic
Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23.

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation_

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with international
accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Adopted IFRSs’).

The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

     - Statement of Cash Flows;

     - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;

     - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;

     - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures;

     - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and

     - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.

The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting the
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the
Company financial statements.

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The
consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All
values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The time
period that the directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis of
accounting is a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the
‘period of assessment’).

The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value, together with the
main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, business performance and position of the
Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a
limited impact on the Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from
multi-year contracts with customers with the services provided being critical to our customer’s operations and
these services can be performed remotely by the Group.

The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a severe but plausible downside
case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, and
borrowing facilities (see note 15 for the details on the loans and note 25 for details on the post year end
refinancing). As a result of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that
the Group and the Company is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast
significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at
least 12 months.

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary
undertakings prepared to 31 December 2020. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains
control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation (continued)_

control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net
assets acquired.

Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of
the Company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary
undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends,
together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2020. Financial statements of
subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions,
unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principles of
predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the
same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger
adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal
value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of
the subsidiary is taken to other reserves.

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position
date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation
means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.

The following judgements and estimates have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the
financial statements:

(i) _Development costs:_ The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance
with the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that
technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised,
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the
expected period of benefits.

(ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements_
and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition
or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an
assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the
estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the
final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax
provisions and accruals.

(iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are_
made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(iv) _Provision for doubtful debts: The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss_
(ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed
default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in
determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic
conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may
not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail.

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)_

(v) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group_
are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair values. There are a number
of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of
which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition
requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and
valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash
flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods
after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Please see
note 24 for further details.

(vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial measurement of the_
lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR),
where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the
individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to
the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In
determining the IBR, the group makes judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and
necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease.

_(e)_ _Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets
acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the
recognition criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated
amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding
capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets
are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful
economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be
impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life
is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected
pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

The useful economic lives of intangible assets with finite lives are as follow:

Databases ..................................................... 10 years
Technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years
Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . 11-25 years
Trade names . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10-20 years
Development costs ....................................... 3 years
Other intangibles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1-8 years

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or
losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised.

_(f)_ _Research and development costs_

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are
satisfied:

     - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

     - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

     - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

     - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

     - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

     - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent
period.

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring
the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is
amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit. The current weighted average life of capitalised
development costs is 3 years (2019: 3 years).

_(g)_ _Goodwill_

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred,
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of
consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair
value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase,
the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating
units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit
or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset
capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of
acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Leasehold improvements ............................................. over the period of lease
Computer equipment .................................................... 3 years
Fixtures and fittings ....................................................... 3 years
Right-of-use assets ....................................................... over the period of lease

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition.

_(j)_ _Investment in subsidiaries_

Investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at cost, being either the value of the capital injected into a
subsidiary through subscription of shares or by way of a capital contribution, or the amount of consideration
paid to another group entity under common control for the equity shares issued by the subsidiary. Subsequent
to initial measurement, the investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less impairment.

_(k)_ _Leases_

_Leases as a lessee_

The Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a lease if the contract conveys the right to control
the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases
except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month or less and leases of low-value assets.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs
incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are not included in the lease liability and an
estimate of the restoration costs required under the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received.
Depreciation on the right-of-use asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of subsequent measurement
of the right-of-use asset, the Group follows the policy for property, plant and equipment, being cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term
that are not paid at commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease
liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments and corresponding adjustment of such remeasurement is
made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-of-use asset is reduced to
zero.

The Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease
components as a single lease commitment. The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases
of low-value items in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. Low-value items comprise IT
equipment.

_Leases as a lessor_

When the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as a finance lease when the Group transfers
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted
for as an operating lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(k)_ _Leases (continued)_

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising
from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which
the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

_(l)_ _Pension costs_

The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of
Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance
with the rules of the scheme.

_(m)_ _Provisions for liabilities_

A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

_(n)_ _Financial assets_

_Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial_
recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception
of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the Group initially measures a
financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss,
transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement_ — for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets held by the Group
are classified in the following categories:

     - Financial assets at amortised cost — the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the
following conditions are met: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold
assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (ii) based on the contractual terms, the expected cashflows
are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such
financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR)
method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.

     - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial assets held for trading and
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets
mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are
accounted for as separate derivatives, other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss are
classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the
Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

_Impairment of financial assets — the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all_
debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the
contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to
receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.

For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does
not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each
reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic
environment.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(n)_ _Financial assets (continued)_

The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past
due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs
for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the
provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the
contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Group’s intention and ability to successfully
recover balances through enforcement activities.

_Derecognition — a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar_
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial
Position) when:

     - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

     - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset.

_(o)_ _Financial liabilities_

_Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at_
initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement_ — the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as
described below:

    - Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial liabilities held for trading
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This
includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation
criteria in IFRS 9. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of
Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

     - Loans and borrowings — after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR
amortisation is included as finance expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Derecognition of financial liabilities — a liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to_
it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified,
such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees
incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(p)_ _Fair value measurement of financial instruments_

When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Statement of Financial Position
cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation
techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from
observable markets where possible. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit
risk and the selection of appropriate discount curves, and other market inputs.

_(q)_ _Classification of financial instruments_

An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The
initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and
equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual
value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair
value basis.

_(r)_ _Foreign currency translation_

Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity using the exchange
rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange
gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of
each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign
operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their
statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.

_(s)_ _Taxation_

The tax expense for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to
other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly
to equity, otherwise, income tax is recognised in profit or loss.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted or substantively enacted for the financial year.

Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
Statement of Financial Position date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits
the Company to make a single net payment.

_(t)_ _Revenue recognition_

The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services.

_(t)_ _Revenue recognition (continued)_

_Multi element arrangements and allocations of the transaction price_

The Group derives revenue from licences and subscriptions of its software and related professional services,
which can include; assistance in implementation, customisation and integration, post-contract customer
support, and other professional services.

In the event that an agreement with the Group’s customers is executed in close proximity to other agreements
with the same customer, the Group evaluates whether the separate agreements have a single commercial
objective and should be combined; if so, the agreements together are considered a single multi-element
arrangement.

The Group accounts for individual elements as distinct performance obligations when an element is separately
identifiable from other elements in the agreement and if the customer can benefit from the separate element.

Where such multiple-element arrangements exist, the transaction price is allocated to each performance
obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of each performance
obligation is determined based on the best estimate of the current market price of each of the performance
obligations when sold separately.

In determining the total transaction price, the Group considers the fair value of the consideration, both fixed
and variable, to which the Group expects to be entitled and adjusts the promised amount of consideration for
the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either
explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the Group with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of
goods or services to the customer, where the period of the financing is over one year.

_Sale of and subscription of licences_

Licence revenue is recognised over the period of the related sales agreement, where the licence is considered
a right to access IP or the licence is considered a right of use of the software but it is not distinct from post
contractual support (“PCS”).

In all other circumstances, where the licence is considered a right of use of the software, licence revenue is
recognised when the Group has no further obligations to perform in respect of the licence.

Where the licence is distinct and separated from the PCS, the PCS revenue is recognised over the PCS period
in the sales agreement.

_Rendering of services_

Revenue pursuant to time and material professional services contracts are recognised as services are
performed. Revenues from fixed-fee professional services contracts are recognised based on the actual
service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is
determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours. Estimates of
revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the
circumstances that give rise to the revision become known.

Revenue from transaction volumes relates to customer use of the Dealogic platform in running capital market
transactions. It is billed on a per-transaction basis and is recognised in the same accounting period in which
the transaction takes place.

_Incremental costs of obtaining contracts_

The Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers that are directly associated
with the contract as an asset if those costs are expected to be recoverable and records them in “Intangible
assets” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Incremental costs of obtaining contracts are those
costs that are incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the contract
had not been obtained.

_(u)_ _New standards and interpretations_

_New standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2020_

The following amendments to standards have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements:

Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations ........................................................................... 1 January 2020

Amendments to IFRS 3 — In October 2019, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in
IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a
business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether
market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess
whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce
an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, but may impact
future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations.

_New standards and interpretations effective after 1 January 2020_

Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed
below. This listing is of relevant standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to
be applicable at a future date.

Amendments to IFRS 16 COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 June 2021
Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark

_Reform — Phase 2 ........................................................................................................................ 1 January 2021_
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments — Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for derecognition of

_financial liabilities ........................................................................................................................... 1 January 2022_

Amendments to IFRS 16 — In May 2020, IASB issued COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions — Amendment to
_IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease_
modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a
practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession from a
lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments
resulting from the COVID-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under
IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification.

The original amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. In March
2021, the IASB issued _COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021, which extended the_
availability of the practical expedient by one year. Earlier application is permitted. The Group intends to adopt
this amendment when it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform — Phase 2 —
The amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank
offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free rate (RFR).

The amendments include the following practical expedients:

     - A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows that are directly required
by the reform, to be treated as changes to a floating interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market
rate of interest.

     - Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations and hedge documentation
without hedging relationship being discontinued.

     - Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when an
RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component.

_New standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2020 (continued)_

These amendments are effective for the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The amendments
apply retrospectively and earlier application is permitted. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact,
if any, of the amendments to the standards.

Amendment to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments — Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial
liabilities — The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a
new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability.
These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or
received by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. An entity applies the amendment to financial
liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the
entity first applies the amendment.

The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier
adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendment when it becomes effective but currently does not
expect to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

The Group typically invoices clients annually in advance for all contract revenue streams except for
professional service revenue, which can be either billed in advance or on satisfaction of milestones. As such,
substantially all deferred revenue at the end of an accounting year will be recognised in the following year, with
the exception of (i) contracts where revenue recognition is deferred due to uncertainty over payment and
(ii) contracts with a significant financing component.

Accrued revenue primarily relates to the Group’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at
the reporting date. Deferred revenue primarily relates to the advance consideration received from customers
for contracts, for which revenue will be recognised on satisfaction of performance obligations in the next
reporting period.

_(d)_ _Circumstances affecting future tax changes:_

The tax charge in future periods will be impacted by any changes to the corporation tax rate in force in the
countries in which the Group operates. There is a degree of uncertainty over the level of the future tax rate,
due to a combination of factors including US tax reform, future BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting)
actions and the potential impact of COVID-19 on tax rates internationally.

On 3 March 2021 the UK Government announced that legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to
increase the main rate of corporation tax to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. This change will impact the
Group’s future tax charges and deferred tax balances. The Group estimates that the remeasurement of its UK
deferred tax balances would result in an increase to the Group tax charge of $28.6m in the year ended
31 December 2021.

_Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment review_

The Group performed its annual impairment test in December 2020 and 2019. The recoverable amount is
based on seven-year cashflow projections which have been approved by senior management, which is in line
with the period used by management in assessing the business.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the
revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue
commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of

beyond the projection period are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate (2019: 2%). No impairments were

_Amounts owed from fellow subsidiary undertakings_

Amounts owed from fellow subsidiary undertakings refers to trade balances and loans extended to fellow
subsidiaries. The loans carried an interest rate between 0% – 4%. Amounts owed from fellow subsidiary
undertakings are repayable on demand.

_Expected credit losses on trade receivables_

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and
control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the
ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar
loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at
the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss
rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by
scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical
data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected
lives of the receivables.

In 2017, the Company issued 4,056,694 ordinary shares with a par value of $1 for a total subscription price of
$641,271,000 which resulted in share premium of $637,214,000. The total subscription price was satisfied by
way of $400,000,000 cash received and $241,271,000 fair value of shares in Diamond Topco Limited as part
of a share-for-share exchange in relation to the acquisition of that company.

_SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT_

This reserve records the amount above the nominal value received for shares issued. In 2019 the Company
undertook a capital reduction, which resulted in the share premium being converted to distributable reserves.

_CAPITAL MANAGEMENT_

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, share premium and all
other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s
capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. The Group’s capital management, amongst other
things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

_Financial risk_

The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk,
currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place which seeks to
limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about
the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for
measuring and managing the risk.

The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant
risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively.

(i) Credit risk

_Exposure to credit risk_

Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and
outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial
institutions.

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically.
The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could
be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry.

The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables
based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all
overdue debtors. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial
statements.

_Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_

Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit
rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time.

The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit
exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the financial assets.

(ii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover
unanticipated financing requirements.

(iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is
to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return
earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each
of which are dealt with as follows:

Currency risk

Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management
requires all Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.

The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where
debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place.

The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities
when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Overall, the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and
liabilities in each currency.

The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional
currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows:

A 5% strengthening or weakening of the exchange rates in respect of the translation of amounts not

Interest rate risk

The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. The table below examines the effect
that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in LIBOR would have on profit before tax over a one year period:


_2020_
_$’000_


_2019_
_$’000_


_Increase / (decrease) on profit before tax:_

Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR ........................................... 1,354 1,435
Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR ........................................ (1,354) (1,435)

_Fair values and levelling_

For all material categories of financial assets and financial liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable
approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits,
trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate
their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in
either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings.

23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND SECRETARY’S INTERESTS

The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, a company incorporated in
England and Wales.

The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is Bessel Capital S.àr.l., a company
incorporated in Luxembourg.

The parent undertaking of the largest group of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are
prepared and of which the Company is a member is ION Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated
in the Republic of Ireland.

Neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor children, held any interests in the
shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any other group undertaking, except as follows:

Mr. A. Pignataro owned directly 100% (2019: 100%) of Bessel Capital S.àr.l.

24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On 12 September 2019, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Selerity Inc (“Selerity”).

Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement during the
year.

In valuing the net assets of Selerity on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation
techniques, specifically:

1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are
expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.

2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be
generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets.

3. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to
fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin.

24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (Continued)

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, management estimate that Selerity’s revenue would have
been $5.0m and loss before tax for the year would have been $0.5m. In determining these amounts
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of
the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019.

25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE

On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt facilities. I-logic Technologies
Bidco Limited acquired the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc.;
collectively referred to as “Acuris”. The acquisition of the three Acuris companies was a common control
transaction which was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange.

Concurrent with the group reorganisation, the newly combined group refinanced the existing debt facilities of
both Acuris and the Group by drawing down a new debt facility to repay its existing debt facilities and
extended the maturity of both the USD and Euro facilities to 16 February 2028.

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2019**

The directors present herewith the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the audited consolidated financial
statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2019.

_PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS_

The principal activity of I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) is
to develop and market content, data, analytics and software solutions to participants of the global capital markets.
The Group generates revenue from data and product licenses and from professional services.

The Group has adopted IFRS 16, the new leases standard using the modified retrospective approach with an initial
application date of 1 January 2019. The resulting impact on transition is disclosed in note 1(s).

The Company was incorporated on 14 November 2017. The Group will continue to sell and develop market content
and software solutions.

On 12 September 2019, the Group acquired 100% of Selerity Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Selerity”), a technology
provider specialised in artificial intelligence solutions for unstructured data and content.

_Financial Performance Indicators_

The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation) and Profit on Ordinary Activities after Taxation.

_Revenue_

The Group’s total revenue was $184.6 million in 2019 (2018: $169.8 million). The increase in total revenue for 2019
as compared to 2018 of $14.8 million.

_EBITDA_

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation was $96.4 million in 2019 (2018: $69.3 million).

_Loss on Ordinary Activities after Taxation_

Loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2019 was$3.9 million (2018: loss of
$43.8 million), after a $66.0 million charge related to the amortisation of intangible assets (2018: $67.4 million).

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_

The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are:

     - The Group currently derives most of its revenue from a limited number of products. As a result, a
reduction in demand for, or sales of, these products would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and operating results;

     - The Group derives all of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The Group’s
business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in
that industry;

     - The Group depends on large transactions from a limited number of customers for a significant portion of
its revenue and the delay or loss of any large customer could adversely affect the Group’s business,
financial condition and operating results;

     - Potential defects in the Group’s products or failure to provide services for the Group’s customers could
cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s
reputation;

     - The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could obtain and use
the Group’s technology without authorisation;

F 65


-----

**I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED**

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

    - The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property or proprietary
rights of others;

     - The Group has funded its activities through operating cash flows and bank borrowings. The Group
expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales revenues will fund its
existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater
than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional
financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of financial
instruments is discussed in note 15.

The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks and uncertainties.
The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and proactively limit the associated risks.

_SECTION 172 STATEMENT_

The Directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider,
in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members and key
stakeholders. The directors when making key decisions for the Company have had considered the impact of their
decisions to the Company’s key stakeholders and to wider society by continuing to facilitate the critical processes
within our clients’ businesses, and by focusing on innovation in the capital markets in order to contribute to
continuous process improvement for our clients.

One of Dealogic’s core values is to long term thinking and building long-term sustainable relationships with our
customers. Dealogic software helps our customers to improve decision-making, increase efficiency, simplify
complex processes and empower their people. This is achieved by partnering with our customers to enable them to

employees to succeed through a positive culture and continuous improvement. There are a number of measures in
place to keep employees up to date on recent developments of company and allow employee engagement with
senior management, through face to face meetings and electronic media.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2019**

The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements (“financial
statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2019.

_DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_

The names of the directors who served at any time during the financial year are as listed on page F-50.

The interests of the directors and company secretary in shares of the company or other group companies are set
out in note 23 to the financial statements.

_DIVIDENDS_

In 2019, a dividend of $6.2 million was declared and paid (2018: $Nil).

_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_

The Group has invested in the development of new and existing products with considerable effort applied by the
technical and software development teams. As set out in note 1(f), when certain criteria are met the costs are
capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the useful life of the asset, currently considered to be 3 years.
These capitalised development costs are shown in note 9. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.

_GOING CONCERN_

Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, including the expected impact of COVID-19, and
its current financial position, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue
to manage its business risks successfully and to remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the report and accounts.

_FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS_

The Group’s financial risk management objective is to identify financial risks and implement suitable risk reducing
measures where appropriate.

In implementing this objective, Group policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash amounts are held to meet all
working capital requirements and sufficient committed borrowing facilities are available to meet longer term
requirements.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. For information on these risks
please refer to note 15.

_EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_

In March and April 2020, the Group repurchased and extinguished $16.8 million nominal value of the Group’s debt.

Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is causing economic disruptions in
most countries. Various measures have been taken by Governments around the world to contain the virus which
have had a significant impact on global economic activity.

The Group’s principle activity is to develop and market data and software solutions, and as such a significant
proportion of our projects can be performed remotely. The Group has moved to remote working arrangements
which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of our staff and to enable our business to operate with minimal
impact.

A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with customers with the services
provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence limited immediate impact is expected on the Group’s
revenue stream. Having considered reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, the directors believe it is still
appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

_DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT_

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the Group and Company
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU and applicable law, and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial
Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their profit or loss for that year. In
preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:

     - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

     - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;

     - for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU;

     - for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, including FRS
101, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements;

     - assess the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concerns; and

     - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.

_ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS_

The Company will seek to minimise adverse impacts on the environment from its activities, whilst continuing to
address health, safety and economic issues. The Company has complied with all applicable legislation and
regulations.

_DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR_

So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information, being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing their report, of which the auditor
is unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow directors and the Company’s auditor, each director has taken all the
steps that he is obliged to take as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

office in accordance with section 487 of the Companies Act 2006.

On behalf of the Directors

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited (“the company”) for the year ended
31 December 2019 which comprise the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated and
company statement of financial position, consolidated and company statement of changes in equity, consolidated
cash flow statement and related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.

In our opinion:

     - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s
affairs as at 31 December 2019 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

     - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union;

     - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting
standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

     - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are
independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**Going concern**

The directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate
the group or the company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group and the
company’s financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material
uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a
year from the date of approval of the financial statements (“the going concern period”).

We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that
basis for a period of at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements. In our evaluation of the
directors’ conclusions, we considered the inherent risks to the group’s business model, including the impact of
Brexit, and analysed how those risks might affect the group and company’s financial resources or ability to
continue operations over the going concern period. We have nothing to report in these respects.

However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes
that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of reference to
a material uncertainty in this auditor’s report is not a guarantee that the group or the company will continue in
operation.

**Strategic report and directors’ report**

The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider whether, based
on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the
financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

     - we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;

     - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

     - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED (Continued)**

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

     - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

     - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
or

     - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

     - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on page F-54, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/
auditorsresponsibilities.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

_(a)_ _General information_

The financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 28 April 2020. I-Logic
Technologies Bidco Limited is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The registered
office address is 10 Queen Street Place, London, EC4R 1BE. The principal activities of the Company and its
subsidiaries are described in the Directors’ Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23.

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation_

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain
respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS as adopted by the EU.

The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

        - Statement of Cash Flows;

        - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;

        - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;

        - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures;

        - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and

        - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.

The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting their
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the
Company financial statements.

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for
derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are
presented in US Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the
nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the directors are confident that the
company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months
from the date of approval of the financial statements, considering the below.

A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear subscription contracts with customers,
which gives a highly visible income stream for the Group. The Group’s forecasts and projections, including
reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, show that the Group will continue to generate positive
operating cash flows to fund both operations and financing requirements of the Group.

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary
undertakings prepared to 31 December 2019.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the
Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions as detailed below. Control is
achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a
business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired.

Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of
the company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary
undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends,

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation (continued)_

together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2019. Financial statements of
subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions,
unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principle of
predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the
same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger
adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal
value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of
the subsidiary is taken to other reserves.

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position
date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation
means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.

The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on
amounts recognised in the financial statements;

(i) _Development costs:_ The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance
with their accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that
technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised,
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the
expected period of benefits.

(ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements_
and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition
or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an
assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the
estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the
final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax
provisions and accruals.

(iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are_
made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(iv) _Provision for doubtful debts: For trade receivables, the Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the_
expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s
historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant
judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and
future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic
conditions may not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further
detail.

(v) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group_
are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair values. There are a number
of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of
which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition
requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and
valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash

flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods
after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Please see
note 25 for further details.

(vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial measurement of the_
lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR),
where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the
individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to
the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In
determining the IBR, the group makes judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and
necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease, as set out above.

_(e)_ _Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets
acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the separation
criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either
finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at
least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or
losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. The useful economic life of intangible assets is
between 1 and 20 years.

_(f)_ _Research and development costs_

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are
satisfied:

     - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

     - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

     - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

     - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

     - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

     - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(f)_ _Research and development costs (continued)_

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring
the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is
amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit, currently considered to be 3 years.

_(g) Goodwill_

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred,
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of
consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair
value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase,
the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating
units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit
or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amountin order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset
capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of
acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Leasehold improvements over the period of lease
Computer equipment 3 years
Fixtures and fittings 3 years
Right-of-use assets over the period of lease

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition.

_(j)_ _Leases_

_Leases as a lessee — the Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a lease if the contract_
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases
except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month or less and leases of low-value assets.

F 81

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(j)_ _Leases (continued)_

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs
incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are not included in the lease liability and an
estimate of the restoration costs required under the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received.
Depreciation on the right-of-use asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of subsequent measurement
of the right-of-use asset the Group follows the policy of property, plant and equipment, being cost less
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term
that are not paid at commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease
liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate basis. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments with a corresponding adjustment made to the carrying
amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-of-use asset is reduced to zero.

The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value items in profit or loss on a
straight line basis over the lease term. Low-value items comprise IT equipment.

_Leases as a lessor — when the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as a finance lease when_
the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the
lease is accounted for as an operating lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease
separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising
from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which
the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

The accounting polices applicable to the Group as a lessor in the comparative period were not different from
IFRS 16. However, when the Group was an intermediate lessor, the sub-leases were classified with reference
to the underlying asset.

_(k)_ _Pension costs_

The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of
Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance
with the rules of the scheme.

_(l)_ _Provisions for liabilities_

A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

_(m)_ _Financial assets_

_Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial_
recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception
of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied
the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a
financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement_ — for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets held by the Group
are classified in the following categories:

     - Financial assets at amortised costs — the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of
the following conditions are met; (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(m)_ _Financial assets (continued)_

assets to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) based on the contractual terms the expected cashflows
are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such
financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR)
method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.

     - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial assets held for trading and
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets
mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are
accounted for as separate derivatives other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss; are
classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the
Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

_Impairment of financial assets — the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all_
debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the
contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to
receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its
historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the
economic environment.

The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past
due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs
for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the
provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the
contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Groups intention and ability to successfully
recover balances through enforcement activities.

_Derecognition — a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar_
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial
Position) when:

     - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

     - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset.

_(n)_ _Financial liabilities_

_Initial recognition and measurement_ — the Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at
initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement_ — the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as
described below:

     - Loans and borrowings — after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR
amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(n)_ _Financial liabilities (continued)_

    - Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial liabilities held for trading
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This
includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation
criteria in IFRS 9, as outlined above. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in
the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

_Derecognition of financial liabilities — a liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to_
it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified,
such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees
incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(o)_ _Classification of financial instruments_

An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The
initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and
equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual
value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair
value basis.

_(p)_ _Foreign currency translation_

Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at
the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of
each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign
operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their
statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.

_(q)_ _Taxation_

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other
comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly
to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in profit or loss.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted for the period.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(q)_ _Taxation (continued)_

Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
Statement of Financial Position date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits
the Group to make a single net payment.

_(r)_ _Revenue recognition_

The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. Revenue comprises subscriptions and transaction fees, and fees for related services.

_Subscription and transaction revenue_

Revenue from subscription services and software licenses is recognised evenly over the period of the
subscription/license. Where transaction fees relate to a customer’s investment banking transaction, revenue is
recognised when the customer’s transaction completes. Other transaction fees are recognised as revenue on
delivery of the related service.

_Rendering of services_

Revenue pursuant to time and material professional services contracts are recognised as services are
performed. Revenues from fixed-fee professional services contracts are recognised based on the actual
service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is
determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours. Estimates of
revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the
circumstances that give rise to the revision become known.

_Multi element arrangements and allocations of the transaction price_

The Group derives revenue from licenses and subscriptions of its software and related professional services,
which can include; assistance in implementation, customisation and integration, post-contract customer
support, and other professional services.

In the event that an agreement with the Group’s customers is executed in close proximity to other agreements
with the same customer, the Group evaluates whether the separate agreements have a single commercial
objective and should be combined; if so, the agreements together are considered a single multi-element
arrangement.

The Group accounts for individual elements as distinct performance obligations when an element is separately
identifiable from other elements in the agreement and if the customer can benefit from the separate element.

Where such multiple-element arrangements exist, the transaction price is allocated to each performance
obligation based on the stand alone selling prices. The Stand-alone selling price of each performance
obligation is determined based on the best estimate of the current market price of each of the performance
obligations when sold separately.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(r)_ _Revenue recognition (continued)_

In determining the total transaction price, the Group considers the fair value of the consideration, both fixed
and variable, to which an entity expects to be entitled and adjusts the promised amount of consideration for
the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either
explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of
goods or services to the customer, where the period of the financing is over one year.

_(s)_ _New standards and interpretations_

The following standards and amendments have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements:

IFRS 16 — Leases

The Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with an initial application date of
1 January 2019. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS
17.

On transition, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified
as ‘operating leases’. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments,
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets are
measured at an amount equal to lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease
payment.

In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the
standard:

        - applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics.

        - relying on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as an alternative to performing an
impairment review.

        - accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January
2019 as short-term leases.

        - excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial
application,

        - not separating lease and non-lease components, and instead accounting for these as a single
component.

        - and using hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or
terminate the lease.

The Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial
application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date the group relied on its assessment
made applying IAS 17 and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIS) Interpretation 4 Determining whether an
Arrangement contains a Lease.

For leases that were previously classified as finance leases, the Group measured the right-of-asset and liability
at the carrying amount of the finance lease asset and liability immediately before the date of initial application.

Relevant standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s
financial statements are listed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.

Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 January 2020

Amendments to IFRS 3 — In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in
IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a
business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether
market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess
whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce
an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments.

The Group intends to adopt the amendments to IFRS 3 when they become effective. Since the amendments
apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur on or after the date of first application, the
Group will not be affected by these amendments on the date of transition.

_(d)_ _Circumstances affecting future tax changes:_

The tax charge in future periods will be impacted by any changes to the corporation tax rate in force in the
countries in which the Group operates. There is a degree of uncertainty over the level of the future tax rate,
due to a combination of factors including US tax reform, future BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting)
actions and the potential impact of Covid-19 on tax rates internationally.

_Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment review_

The annual impairment test was performed in December 2019. The recoverable amount is based on six year
cashflow projections which have been approved by senior management, which is in line with the period used
by management in assessing the business. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the
discount rate applied, future growth rate of revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the
existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing
and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific
market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future. Cashflow projections are discounted
using post-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections between 9% and 12% and cash flows beyond
the projection period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%. No impairment was indicated. The directors
have considered the impact of sensitivities on the key inputs, as listed above, into their impairment review and
have concluded that there are no foreseen sensitivities that would result in an impairment charge for the
Group at 31 December 2019.

12. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (Continued)

_Expected credit losses on trade receivables_

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures
and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables and contract
assets are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit
terms of 0 – 30 days.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the
ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar
loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at
the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss
rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by
scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical
data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected
lives of the receivables.

Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade receivables and contract
assets using a provision matrix:

13. SHARE CAPITAL (Continued)

In 2017, the Company issued 4,056,695 ordinary shares of $1 for an aggregate subscription price of
$641,271,000 giving rise to a share premium of $637,214,000. The aggregate subscription price was satisfied
by way of $400,000,000 cash received and $241,271,000 fair value of shares in Diamond Topco Limited as
part of a share-for-share exchange in relation to the acquisition of that company.

_SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT_

This reserve records the amount above the nominal value received for shares sold. In 2019 the Company
undertook a capital reduction, which resulted in the share premium being converted to distributable reserves.

_CAPITAL MANAGEMENT_

For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, share premium and all
other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s
capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. The Group’s capital management, amongst other
things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans.

All debt instruments have a variable interest rate.

_Financial risk_

The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk,
currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management program in place which seeks to limit
the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the
Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and
managing the risk, and the Group’s management of capital.

The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant
risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively.

(i) Credit risk

_Exposure to credit risk_

Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and
outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial
institutions.

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically.
The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could
be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry.

The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables
based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all
overdue debtors. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to
measure expected credit losses, as described in note 1(m) and in note 12 to the financial statements. The
aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements.

_Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_

Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit
rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time.

The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit
exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the assets.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(ii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover
unanticipated financing requirements.

The following are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and long term employment benefits,
including estimated interest payments excluding the impact of netting agreements:

(iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income
or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is
to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return
earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each
of which are dealt with as follows:

Currency risk

Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management
requires all Group entities to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.

The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where
debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place.

The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities
when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Overall the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and
liabilities in each currency.

Interest rate risk

The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. At 31 December 2018 and 2019, the
interest on the USD external borrowings was based on USD Libor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of
3.25% and the interest on EUR external borrowings was based on Euribor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a
margin of 3.25%. The interest rate profile of the borrowings is:

At the year end, there is no foreseen movement in USD or EUR debt floating interest rates that would have any
impact on the interest payments, taking into consideration the interest rate floor and the current prevailing
floating rates.

During the period, the Euribor rate remained below the 1% floor on the Group’s EUR denominated debt.

(iii) Market risk (continued)

Interest rate risk (continued)

During the period, the USD Libor rate exceeded the 1% floor on the Group’s US Dollar denominated debt. The
table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in Libor would have on profit before
tax over a one year period:

_2019_ _2018_

Increase/(decrease) on profit before tax:

Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR .......................................... 1,435 1,460
Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR ........................................ (1,435) (1,460)

_Fair values and levelling_

For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable
approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits,
trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate
their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in
either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings.

16. LEASES

The Group leases land and buildings for its office space. The leases of office space typically run for a period
between 1 and 15 years.

Refer to note 15(ii) for maturity analysis of lease liabilities and to note 11 for roll forward of right-of-use asset.
The impact of transition to IFRS 16 is disclosed in note 1(s).

techniques, specifically:

1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are
expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.

2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be
generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets.

3. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to
fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin.

24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (Continued)

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, management estimate that Selerity’s revenue would have
been $5.0m and loss before tax for the year would have been $0.5m. In determining these amounts
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of
the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019.

25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE

In March and April 2020, the Group repurchased and extinguished $16.8 million nominal value of the Group’s
debt.

Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is causing economic disruptions
in most countries. Various measures have been taken by Governments around the world to contain the virus
which have had a significant impact on global economic activity.

The Group’s principle activity is to develop and market data and software solutions, and as such a significant
proportion of our projects can be performed remotely. The Group has moved to remote working arrangements
which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of our staff and to enable our business to operate with
minimal impact.

A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with customers with the
services provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence limited immediate impact is expected on
the Group’s revenue stream. Having considered reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, the
directors believe it is still appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

26. APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors approved and authorised for issue the financial statements in respect of the year ended
31 December 2019 on 28 April 2020.

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2018**

The directors present herewith the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the audited consolidated financial
statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2018.

_PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS_

The principal activity of I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) is
to develop and market content and software solutions to financial firms throughout the global capital markets. The
Group generates revenue from product licenses and from professional services.

The Company was incorporated on 14 November 2017. The Group will continue to sell and develop market content
and software solutions.

On 21 December 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Diamond Topco Limited and its trading
subsidiaries, including the Dealogic group of companies.

_Financial Performance Indicators_

The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation,
depreciation and amortisation) and Profit on Ordinary Activities after Taxation.

_Revenue_

The Group’s total revenue was $169.8 million in 2018 and $3.6 million for the period ended 31 December 2017.
The increase in total revenue for 2017 as compared to 2018 of $166.2 million is a result of a full years activity being
included for 2018.

_EBITDA_

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation was $69.3 million in 2018 and a loss of
$6.9 million in the period ended 31 December 2017. The loss in 2017 year was caused by costs associated with the
acquisition of Dealogic in December 2017.

_Loss on Ordinary Activities after Taxation_

Loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2018 was $43.8 million (2017: profit of
$12.5 million), after a $67.4 million charge related to the amortisation of intangible assets (2017: $1.8 million).

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_

The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are:

     - The Group currently derives most of its revenue from a limited number of products. As a result, a
reduction in demand for, or sales of, these products would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
business, financial condition and operating results;

     - The Group derives all of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The Group’s
business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in
that industry;

     - The Group depends on large transactions from a limited number of customers for a significant portion of
its revenue and the delay or loss of any large customer could adversely affect the Group’s business,
financial condition and operating results;

     - Potential defects in the Group’s products or failure to provide services for the Group’s customers could
cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s
reputation;

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2018 (Continued)**

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (Continued)_

     - The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could obtain and use
the Group’s technology without authorisation;

    - The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property or proprietary
rights of others;

     - The Group has funded its activities through operating cash flows and bank borrowings. The Group
expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales revenues will fund its
existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater
than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional
financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of financial
instruments is discussed in note 15.

The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks and uncertainties.
The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and proactively limit the associated risks.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2018**

The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements (“financial
statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2018.

_DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_

The names of the directors who served at any time during the financial year are as listed on page F-92.

The interests of the directors and company secretary in shares of the company or other group companies are set
out in note 23 to the financial statements.

_DIVIDENDS_

No dividends were declared in the year (2017: $Nil).

_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_

The Group has invested in the development of new and existing products with considerable effort applied by the
technical and software development teams. As set out in note 1(f), when certain criteria are met the costs are
capitalised as intangible fixed assets and amortised over the useful life of the asset, currently considered to be 3 years.
These capitalised development costs are shown in note 9. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.

_GOING CONCERN_

Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business and its current financial position, the directors
are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue to manage its business risks successfully
and to remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the report and accounts.

_FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS_

The Group’s financial risk management objective is to identify financial risks and implement suitable risk reducing
measures where appropriate.

In implementing this objective, Group policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash amounts are held to meet all
working capital requirements and sufficient committed borrowing facilities are available to meet longer term
requirements.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. For information on these risks
please refer to note 15.

_EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_

There were no significant events since the Statement of Financial Position date.

_DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR_

So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is no relevant audit
information, being information needed by the auditor in connection with preparing their report, of which the auditor
is unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow directors and the Company’s auditor, each director has taken all the
steps that he is obliged to take as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

_DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT_

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and the Group and
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law they have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by
the EU and applicable law, and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK
Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial
Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their profit or loss for that year. In
preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required to:

     - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;

     - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;

     - for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU;

     - for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, including FRS
101, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements;

     - assess the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concerns; and

     - use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the
Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company
and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible
for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a general responsibility for taking such
steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and
other irregularities.

_ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS_

The Company will seek to minimise adverse impacts on the environment from its activities, whilst continuing to
address health, safety and economic issues. The Company has complied with all applicable legislation and
regulations.

_AUDITOR_

KPMG LLP, Chartered Accountants, were appointed as auditor and have signified their willingness to continue in
office in accordance with section 487 of the Companies Act 2006.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited (“the company”) for the year ended
31 December 2018 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, Company
Statement of Financial Position, Company Statement of Changes in Equity and related notes, including the
accounting policies in note 1.

In our opinion:

     - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the company’s affairs
as at 31 December 2018 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

     - the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union;

     - the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting
standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and

     - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act
2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (“ISAs (UK)”) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities are described below. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and are
independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard. We
believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion.

**Going concern**

We are required to report to you if we have concluded that the use of the going concern basis of accounting is
inappropriate or there is an undisclosed material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over the use of that
basis for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements. We have nothing
to report in these respects.

**Strategic report and directors’ report**

The directors are responsible for the strategic report and the directors’ report. Our opinion on the financial
statements does not cover those reports and we do not express an audit opinion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the strategic report and the directors’ report and, in doing so, consider whether, based
on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the
financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work:

     - we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors’ report;

     - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial
statements; and

     - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

     - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

     - the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns;
or

     - certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

     - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

We have nothing to report in these respects.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF I-LOGIC TECHNOLOGIES BIDCO LIMITED (Continued)**

**Directors’ responsibilities**

As explained more fully in their statement set out on F-96, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and company’s ability to continue as a going concern,
disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless
they either intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but
to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor’s report. Reasonable
assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
(UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic
decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

A fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

**The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities**

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2018**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

_(a)_ _General information_

The financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 24 April 2019. I-Logic
Technologies Bidco Limited is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The registered
office address is Level 3, One New Change, London, EC4M 9AF. The principal activities of the Company and its
subsidiaries are described in the Directors’ Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23.

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation_

The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain
respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS as adopted by the EU.

The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

     - Statement of Cash Flows;

     - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;

     - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;

     - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures;

     - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and

     - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.

The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting their
Statement of Comprehensive Income. The loss of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 was
$33.0 million.

The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the
Company financial statements.

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for
derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are
presented in US Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the
nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated. The financial statements have been prepared on a
going concern basis having considered anticipated future cash flows.

The comparative information has been updated for the finalisation of the purchase accounting associated with
the acquisition of Diamond Topco Limited (“Dealogic”) on 21 December 2017. This has resulting in an
increase in goodwill and liabilities acquired as set out in note 24.

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_

The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary
undertakings prepared to 31 December 2018.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the
Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions as detailed below. Control is
achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a
business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired.

Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of
the company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary
undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends,
together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2018. Financial statements of
subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions,
unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on
consolidation.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2018 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation (Continued)_

The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principle of
predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the
same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger
adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal
value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of
the subsidiary is taken to other reserves.

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_

The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position
date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation
means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.

The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on
amounts recognised in the financial statements;

(i) _Development costs:_ The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance
with their accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that
technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised,
management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the
expected period of benefits.

(ii) _Tax provisions: The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on 22 December 2017. There are a number of_
impacts for the Group resulting from the US tax reform, which have increased the judgement required as
part of the year end tax provision process. The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax
requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not
be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires
judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although
management believes that the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable,
there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is
reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals.

(iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are_
made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax
rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. For trade receivables, the Group uses
a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past
due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining
the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically
observed default rates, current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default
rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default
rates. Please see note 12 for further detail.

(iv) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group_
are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial position at their fair values. There are a number
of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of
which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition
requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and
valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash
flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods
after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Similarly,
judgement was required for the day one fair value of shares issued as part of the consideration for the
business combination. Please see note 10 and 24 for further details.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2018 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(e)_ _Intangible assets_

Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets
acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the separation
criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income
in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either
finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and
assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The
amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at
least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of
consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The
assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be
supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or
losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. The useful economic life of intangible assets is
between 1 and 20 years.

_(f)_ _Research and development costs_

Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software
products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are
satisfied:

     - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use;

     - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;

     - there is an ability to use or sell the software product;

     - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits;

     - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
software product are available; and

     - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent
period.

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring
the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is
amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit, currently considered to be 3 years.

_(g)_ _Goodwill_

Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred,
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous
equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of
consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair
value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase,

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2018 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(g)_ _Goodwill (continued)_

the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating
units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit
or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the
goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken
annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_

The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any
such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an
estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s
recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows
that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_

Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset
capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates
calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of
acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Leasehold improvements .............................................. over the period of lease
Computer equipment ..................................................... 3 years
Fixtures and fittings ........................................................ 3 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each
reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition.

_(j)_ _Leases_

Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified
as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are
charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease,
unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users benefit. The Group has
no finance leases.

_(k)_ _Pension costs_

The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of
Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance
with the rules of the scheme.

_(l)_ _Provisions for liabilities_

A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is
probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate
can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are
discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(m)_ _Financial assets_

_Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial_
recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s
contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception
of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied
the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a
financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement_ — for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets held by the Group
are classified in the following categories:

     - Financial assets at amortised costs — the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of
the following conditions are met; (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold
assets to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) based on the contractual terms the expected cashflows
are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such
financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR)
method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium
on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.

     - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial assets held for trading and
financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets
mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are
accounted for as separate derivatives other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss; are
classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the
Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

_Impairment of financial assets — the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all_
debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the
contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to
receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on
lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its
historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the
economic environment.

The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past
due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs
for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the
provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the
contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Groups intention and ability to successfully
recover balances through enforcement activities.

_Derecognition — a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar_
financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial
Position) when:

     - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

     - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to
pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’
arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(n)_ _Financial liabilities_

_Initial recognition and measurement_ — the Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at
initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and
borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement_ — the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as
described below:

     - Loans and borrowings — after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account
any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR
amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

    - Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial liabilities held for trading
and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This
includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation
criteria in IFRS 9, as outlined above. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in
the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

_Derecognition of financial liabilities — a liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to_
it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the
same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified,
such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a
new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees
incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(o)_ _Classification of financial instruments_

An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or
equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IFRS 9. The
initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and
equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual
value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair
value basis.

_(p)_ _Foreign currency translation_

Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of
the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at
the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses
resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of
each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign
operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their
statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign
operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date.

_(q)_ _Taxation_

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other
comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly
to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in profit or loss.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have
been enacted for the period.

Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities
and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible
temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related
asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the
Statement of Financial Position date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against
current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits
the Group to make a single net payment.

_(r)_ _Revenue recognition_

The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or
services. Revenue comprises subscriptions and transaction fees, and fees for related services.

_Subscription and transaction revenue_

Revenue from subscription services and software licenses is recognised evenly over the period of the
subscription/license. Where transaction fees relate to a customer’s investment banking transaction, revenue is
recognised when the customer’s transaction completes. Other transaction fees are recognised as revenue on
delivery of the related service.

_Rendering of services_

Revenue pursuant to time and material professional services contracts are recognised as services are
performed. Revenues from fixed-fee professional services contracts are recognised based on the actual
service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is
determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours. Estimates of
revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting
increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the
circumstances that give rise to the revision become known.

_Multi element arrangements and allocations of the transaction price_

The Group derives revenue from licenses and subscriptions of its software and related professional services,
which can include; assistance in implementation, customisation and integration, post-contract customer
support, and other professional services.

In the event that an agreement with the Group’s customers is executed in close proximity to other agreements
with the same customer, the Group evaluates whether the separate agreements have a single commercial
objective and should be combined; if so, the agreements together are considered a single multi-element
arrangement.

_(r)_ _Revenue recognition (Continued)_

The Group accounts for individual elements as distinct performance obligations when an element is separately
identifiable from other elements in the agreement and if the customer can benefit from the separate element.

Where such multiple-element arrangements exist, the transaction price is allocated to each performance
obligation based on the stand alone selling prices. The Stand-alone selling price of each performance
obligation is determined based on the best estimate of the current market price of each of the performance
obligations when sold separately.

In determining the total transaction price, the Group considers the fair value of the consideration, both fixed
and variable, to which an entity expects to be entitled and adjusts the promised amount of consideration for
the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either
explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of
goods or services to the customer, where the period of the financing is over one year.

_(s)_ _New standards and interpretations_

The following standards and amendments have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements:

IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments

The Group has adopted IFRS 9 with an initial application date of 1 January 2018. The comparative information
continues to be reported under IAS 39 with differences arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 recognised in
retained earnings. On transition, the Group classified all financial assets at amortised cost. The adoption of
IFRS 9 has not had a significant effect on the Group’s accounting policies, with the exception of the application
of ECLs as outlined in the accounting policies above. On transition the provision on trade receivables increased
as a result of the movement from the incurred loss model under IAS 39 to the expected credit loss model
under IFRS 9, this difference, net of tax, at the adoption date gives rise to the transitional adjustment reflected
in retained earnings. The reconciliation of the ending impairment allowances in accordance with IAS 39 to the
opening loss allowances determined in accordance with IFRS 9 is set out in note 12.

Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed
below. This listing is of relevant standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to
be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.

IFRS 16 – Leases ........................................................................................................................................ 1 January 2019
IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment..................................................................... 1 January 2019

IFRS 16 — IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether
an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of
Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 requires lessees to account for all leases under a
single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17, with the exception of
low value leases and short term leases. the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to
make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset
during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest
expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset.

The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, without any adjustments to the
comparative period. The detailed impact review along with quantification of this standard is currently under
way; however, the Group anticipates that the impact of adoption of IFRS 16 will result in the recognition of a
lease liability, a right of use asset. The impact on profit or loss will be to reduce the operating expenses and
increase depreciation and interest expense for the Group.

IFRIC 23 — The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve
uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12. The Interpretation specifically addresses the unit of account

for tax uncertainties, and how an entity determines the quantification of the tax uncertainty. Since the Group
operates in a complex multinational tax environment, applying the Interpretation may affect its consolidated
financial statements, this assessment is currently under review.

In the Finance Act 2016, which was enacted on 15 September 2016, the UK Government confirmed that the
main rate of corporation tax in the UK will be reduced from the 19% rate applying from 1 April 2017 to 17%
from 1 April 2020. As a result, the deferred tax asset / liability being carried at 31 December 2018 relating to
UK temporary differences has been recognised at the 17% rate.

_Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment review_

The annual impairment test was performed in December 2018. The recoverable amount is based on six year
cashflow projections which have been approved by senior management, which is in line with the period used
by management in assessing the business. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the
discount rate applied, future growth rate of revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the
existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing
and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific
market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future. Cashflow projections are discounted
using post-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections between 9% and 12% and cash flows beyond
the projection period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%. No impairment was indicated. The directors
have considered the impact of sensitivities on the key inputs, as listed above, into their impairment review and
have concluded that there are no foreseen sensitivities that would result in an impairment charge for the
Group at 31 December 2018.

_Expected credit losses on trade receivables_

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures
and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables and contract
assets are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit
terms of 0 – 30 days.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the
ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar
loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at
the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss
rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by
scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical
data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected
lives of the receivables.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

_Financial risk_

The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk,
currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management program in place which seeks to limit
the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the
Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and
managing the risk, and the Group’s management of capital.

The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk
management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant
risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively.

(i) Credit risk

_Exposure to credit risk_

Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and
outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial
institutions.

_Trade and other receivables_

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically.
The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could
be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry.

The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables
based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all
overdue debtors. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to
measure expected credit losses, as described in note 1(m) and in note 12 to the financial statements. The
aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements.

_Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_

Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit
rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time.

The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit
exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the assets.

(ii) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The
Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient
liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring
unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation.

It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover
unanticipated financing requirements.

710,846 — 114,811 175,990 648,910


(iii) Market risk

Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or
the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return earned by
the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are
dealt with as follows:

Currency risk

Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management requires
all Group entities to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.

The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where
debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place.

The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities
when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Overall the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities
in each currency.

The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency
of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows:

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(iii) Market risk (Continued)

Interest rate risk

The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. At 31 December 2018, the interest on
the USD external borrowings was based on USD Libor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of 3.25% and
the interest on EUR external borrowings was based on Euribor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of
3.25%. The interest rate profile of the borrowings is:

2018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 597.7 —

At the year end, there is no foreseen movement in USD or EUR debt floating interest rates that would have any
impact on the interest payments, taking into consideration the interest rate floor and the current prevailing
floating rates.

During the period, the Euribor rate remained below the 1% floor on the Group’s EUR denominated debt.

During the period, the USD Libor rate exceeded the 1% floor on the Group’s US Dollar denominated debt. The
table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in Libor would have on profit before
tax over a one year period:

Increase/(decrease) on profit before tax: _$’000_
Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR ........................................... 1,460
Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR......................................... (1,460)

_Fair values and levelling_

For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable
approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits,
trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying
amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate
their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in
either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings.

16. LEASES

The Group has entered into operating leases on a number of properties. Future minimum rentals payable
under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are, as follows:

“Related Party Disclosures” for wholly owned subsidiary undertakings from the requirements to give details of

24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

The comparative information has been updated for the finalisation of the purchase accounting associated with
the acquisition of Diamond Topco Limited (“Dealogic”) on 21 December 2017. During the measurement
period the Company has obtained further information on the quantum of liabilities and accruals on the
acquisition date, as a result there in an increase in the goodwill and liabilities acquired of $10,000,000, which
have been adjusted in the comparative period.

On 21 December 2017, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Diamond Topco Limited (“Dealogic”) for
total consideration of $994.5m.

The identifiable net assets have been included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their
provisional acquisition date fair value. The initial assignment of fair value to identifiable net assets acquired
and the consideration paid has been performed on a provisional basis given the timing of closure of these
transactions. Any amendments to these fair values within the twelve month timeframe from the date of
acquisition will be disclosable in the 2018 Annual Report as stipulated by IFRS 3.

Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement during the
prior period. In valuing the net assets of Dealogic on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard
valuation techniques, specifically:

1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are
expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned.

2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be
generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets.

3. Replacement Cost, which considers the value of databases owned by estimating the costs that a market
participant would incur to replace the asset.

4. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to
fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, management estimate that consolidated revenue would
have been $164.8m and consolidated loss before tax for the year would have been $83.2m. In determining
these amounts management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose
on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017.

25. APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board of Directors approved and authorised for issue the financial statements in respect of the year ended
31 December 2018 on 24 April 2019.

**DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT RELATING TO THE REVISED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020**

The directors present herewith their revised annual accounts which comprise the revised
strategic report (‘strategic report’), revised directors’ report (‘directors’ report’) and revised
audited consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial
statements”) of Acuris International Limited (“the Company”) for the financial year ended 31
December 2020 in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and SI
2008/373, The Companies (Revision of Defective Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
These revised annual accounts replace the original annual accounts of the Company for the
financial year ended 31 December 2020 which were approved on 11 April 2021 and should
now represent the statutory accounts of the Company for that financial year. The revised
strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared as at the date of the original annual accounts and not as at the date of the
revision hence any events in between those dates have not been dealt with in the revised
strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements.
The original strategic report, original directors’ report and original consolidated financial
statements did not comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the
recognition of deferred tax assets associated with interest on borrowings as restricted by the
Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom
as management believed that there wasn’t sufficient future taxable income from which the
restricted interest and tax losses could be utilised. However, management had not considered
the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of
Mergermarket Topco Limited and subsidiaries (“Acuris Group”) in 2019. In addition, the Group
revisited the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As
a result, amendments to the original annual accounts have been made. Refer to Note 26 to the
financial statements for disclosure of the amendments to the revised annual accounts.

This revised 2020 annual accounts were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for
issue on 20 January 2022. They were signed on behalf by:

Kunal Gullapalli

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (continued)**

The directors present herewith their Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and audited
consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”)
for the financial year ended 31 December 2020.

_PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS_
Acuris International Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) provide financial
information services, analysis and data to the advisory, corporate and financial communities.
The Group primarily generates revenue from subscription services and expects to continue to
provide these services in the future.

The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited,
the holding company of the Acuris group on 11 July 2019.

_Financial Performance Indicators_
The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation), Profit after Taxation, Net Cashflow and Net
Debt.

_Revenue_
The Group’s total revenue was $277.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 and $136.2
million for the period ended 31 December 2019. The increase in total revenue for 2020 as
compared to the period ended 2019 is $141.0 million or 103.6%.

_EBITDA_
Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation were $10.7 million for the year
ended 31 December 2020 and $32.2 million for the period ended 31 December 2019. The
decrease in EBITDA for 2020 as compared to 2019 is $21.5 million or 66.7%.

_Loss after Taxation_
Loss after taxation, including a $95.4 million charge relating to the amortisation of intangible
assets ($39.7 million for the period ended 31 December 2019), was $174.8 million for the year
ended 31 December 2020 compared to a loss after taxation of $55.6 million for the period ended
31 December 2019. The increase in loss after taxation for 2020 as compared to 2019 is $119.2
million or 214.4%.

_Net Cashflow and Net Debt_
The Group’s cash balance decreased by $2.6 million in 2020 compared to an increase of
$14.2m in the period ended 31 December 2019. Net debt at the end of 2020 was $1,261.5
million compared to $1,181.3 million at the end of 2019. The increase in the net debt is primarily
due to foreign exchange loss on the EUR loan facilities. See the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement for further details on the movements in cash.

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_
The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are:
� The Group derives the majority of its revenues from customers in the financial services
industry. The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be
adversely affected by significant changes in that industry as well as consolidation
amongst the Group’s customers.
� Failure to provide services to the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue
to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation;
� The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could
obtain and use the Group’s technology without authorisation;

F - 144


-----

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (continued)**

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (continued)_
� The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property
or proprietary rights of others;
� The Group has funded its activities through the issue of shares, operating cash flows
and bank borrowings. The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current
working capital and sales revenues will fund its existing operations and payment
obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or
if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional
financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of
financial instruments is discussed in note 15.

The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks
and uncertainties. The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and
proactively limit the associated risks.

_SECTION 172 STATEMENT_
The directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way
which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company
for the benefit of its members and key stakeholders. The directors when making key decisions
for the Company have had considered the impact of their decisions to the Company’s key
stakeholders and to wider society by continuing to facilitate the critical processes within our
customer’s businesses, and by focusing on innovation in the capital markets in order to
contribute to continuous process improvement for our customers.

One of Acuris’ core values is to long term thinking and building long-term sustainable
relationships with our customers. Acuris’s products help our customers to improve decisionmaking, increase efficiency, simplify complex processes and empower their people. This is
achieved by partnering with our customers to enable them to find insights that lead to business
opportunities as well as strengthen compliance and risk management with in depth regulatory
insights.

These long-term sustainable relationships allow us to invest in product development that
enhances our products and provides more useful information to our customers; as well as
managing our commitments to our suppliers and lenders.

The Company recognises our employees are a critical success factor for the Company, hence
we seek to assist our employees to succeed through a positive culture and continuous
improvement. There are a number of measures in place to keep employees up to date on recent
developments of company and allow employee engagement with senior management, through
face to face meetings and electronic media.

On behalf of the Directors

Director

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020**

The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements
(“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December
2020.

_DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_
The interests of the directors and company secretary who served at any time during the financial
year in shares of the Company or other Group companies are set out in note 23 to the financial
statements.

On 21 July 2020, Kunal Gullapalli was appointed as a director of the Company.

_DIVIDENDS_
The Board of Directors did not recommend payment of dividends during the year.

_EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_
On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt facilities. The
Company sold its holdings in Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance
US, Inc to I-logic Technologies Bidco Limited. The sale was a common control transaction which
was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange. Concurrent with the group
reorganisation, the newly combined group refinanced the existing debt facilities by drawing
down a new debt facility to repay its existing debt facilities. The new debt extends the maturity
of both the USD and Euro facilities to 16 February 2028.

_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_
Research and development is concentrated on the development of technology to enable
subscribers to access its products. The capitalised development costs are shown in note 9. All
other development costs are expensed as incurred.

_GOING CONCERN_
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of
accounting. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12 months from
the date of approval of these financial statements (the 'period of assessment').

The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value,
together with the main trends and factors likely to affect future development, business
performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19
outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the Group’s operations,
since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from recurring revenues that are
billed upfront for services that are critical to our customer’s operations and these services can
be performed remotely by the Group.

The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a downside case,
and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position,
and borrowing facilities (see note 15 for details on the loans and note 25 for details on the post
year end refinancing). As a result of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and
consider it appropriate that the Group and the Company is a going concern, having adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified
any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (continued)**

_DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT_
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the
Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for
each financial year. Under that law, the directors have elected to prepare the Group financial
statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and applicable law, and have elected to prepare the
Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law
(UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 101
‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and
of their profit or loss for that year.

In preparing each of the Group and Company financial statements, the directors are required
to:
� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;
� for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in
accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006 and applicable law;
� for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101, have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
� assess the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concerns; and
� use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the
Group or the Company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do
so.

The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to
show and explain the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that its financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

_EMPLOYEE MATTERS_
The well-being of the Group’s employees is safeguarded through the strict adherence to health
and safety standards. The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005 imposes certain
requirements on directors, managers and employees. The Group has taken the necessary
action to ensure compliance with the Act, including the adoption of a safety statement.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED**

**Opinion**
We have audited the revised financial statements of Acuris International Limited (‘the parent
company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2020 which
comprise the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement
of Financial Position, the Company Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 27, including a summary of
significant accounting policies.

These revised financial statements replace the original financial statements approved by the
directors on 11 April 2021. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the revised group financial statements is applicable law and International
Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).

The revised financial statements have been prepared under The Companies (Revision of
Defective Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and accordingly do not take account of
events which have taken place after the date on which the original financial statements were
approved.

In our opinion:
� the revised financial statements give a true and fair view of the group’s and of the parent
company’s affairs as at 31 December 2020 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;
� the revised group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006;
� the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance in
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
� the revised financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs
(UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the revised financial statements section of our
report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are
relevant to our audit of the revised financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

**Emphasis of matter – revision of deferred tax assets**
We draw attention to note 26 to these revised financial statements which describes the need
for revision due to the incorrect accounting of deferred tax assets under IAS12. The original
financial statements were approved on 11 April 2021 and our previous report was signed on
13 April 2021. We have not performed a subsequent events review for the period from the
date of our previous report to the date of this report. Our opinion is not modified in this
respect.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED (Continued)**

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our
evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group and parent company’s ability to continue
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following:
� We confirmed, through management enquiry, our understanding of management’s Going
Concern assessment process. We also engaged with management early to ensure all key
risks and factors were considered in their assessment.
� We obtained management’s going concern assessment which assesses current
economic factors, current profitability and the projected cashflows of the group.
Management’s assessment includes forecasts and sensitivity analysis, covering a period
up to June 2022.We tested the assumptions included in the cash forecasts. We
considered the appropriateness of the methods used to calculate the cash forecast and
determined through inspection and testing of the methodology and calculations that the
methods utilised were appropriate to be able to make an assessment for the group.
� We performed reverse stress testing on the forecasts to understand how severe the
downside scenarios would have to be to result in the elimination of liquidity headroom or a
covenant breach.
� We reviewed managements’ covenant calculations and performed a detailed review of all
the borrowing facilities to assess their continued availability to the Group and company
through the going concern period and to ensure completeness of covenants.
� We read the Group and Company’s going concern disclosures included in the financial
statements in order to assess whether the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity
with the reporting standards.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties
relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on
the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the period to June
2022.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are
described in the relevant sections of this report.  However, because not all future events or
conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to
continue as a going concern.

**Other information**
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the
financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the
other information contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other
information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such
material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine
whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on
the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other
information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED (Continued)**

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

� the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial
statements; and
� the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with
applicable legal requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material
misstatements in the strategic report or directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the
Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
� the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting
records and returns; or
� certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our
## audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**
As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 7, the
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied
that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is
necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s
and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as
a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an
auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance,
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial
statements.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED (Continued)**

**Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting**
**irregularities, including fraud**
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We
design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities,
including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than
the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment
by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to
which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.
However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both
those charged with governance of the entity and management.

Our approach was as follows:
� We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable
to the group and parent company and determined that the most significant are
International Accounting Standards, FRS 101, Companies Act 2006 and the relevant tax
compliance regulations in the UK. In addition, we concluded that there are certain
significant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and regulations
relating to health and safety, employee matters, environmental and bribery and
corruption practices;
� We understood how Acuris International Limited is complying with those frameworks by
making enquiries of management. We corroborated our enquires through reading the
board minutes, and we noted that there was no contradictory evidence;
� We assessed the susceptibility of the group and parent company’s financial statements
to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by inquiry of management,
those charged with governance and others within the group and entity, as to whether
they have knowledge of any actual or suspected fraud. Where this risk was considered
higher, we performed audit procedures to address the fraud risk. These procedures
included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance
that the financial statements were free from fraud or error.
� Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify
noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved reading board
minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations and enquiries of
management.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located
on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.
This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

**Use of our report**
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

_(a)_ _General information_
The consolidated financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the
directors on 20 January 2022. Acuris International Limited is a private company limited
by shares which was incorporated on 18 April 2019 in England and Wales. The
registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, 2[nd] Floor, London, EC4R 1BE,
United Kingdom. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are
described in the Strategic Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note
23.

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation_
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance
with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the
Companies Act 2006 (‘Adopted IFRSs’).

The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial
Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. The Company has applied
the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:

         - Statement of Cash Flows;

         - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;

         - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;

         - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures;

         - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and

         - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.

The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006
from presenting the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial
statements and the Company financial statements.

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a
historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD,
which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest
thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated.

The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and therefore the comparative
numbers are for the period from this date to 31 December 2019 whereas the results for
the year ended 31 December 2020 represent a full year of operations.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis
of accounting. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the
appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12
months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the 'period of
assessment').

F - 162


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation (continued)_
The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates
value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development,
business performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the
COVID-19 outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the
Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from
recurring revenues that are billed upfront for services that are critical to our customer’s
operations and these services can be performed remotely by the Group.

The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and downsize
case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows,
liquidity position, and borrowing facilities (see note 15 for the details on the loans and
note 25 for details on the post year end refinancing). As a result of this review, the
directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group and the
Company is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties
that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company
and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2020. Consolidation of
a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases
when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions
as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to
variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those
returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair
values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired.

Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end
that differs from that of the Company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial
statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest
financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, together with management
accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2020. Financial statements of
subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group
balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group
transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation.

The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under
the principles of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented
as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under
common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the
carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal
value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital
redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities
as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues
and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual
outcomes could differ from those estimates.

The following judgements and estimates have had the most significant effect on
amounts recognised in the financial statements:

(i) _Development costs: The Group capitalises development costs for development_
projects in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is
based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is
confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes
assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the
expected period of benefits.

(ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires_
certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax
outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax
assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the
future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the
estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there
is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that
which is reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals.

(iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision,_
assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the
obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time
value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(iv) _Provision for doubtful debts: The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the_
expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially
based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In
determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the
correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future
economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by
future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default
rates. Please see note 12 for further detail.

(v) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination, the assets and_
liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements
used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business
combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group,
some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits
do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of
goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash
flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)_
In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are
subject to annual impairment testing. Please see notes 9 and 24 for further details.

(vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial_
measurement of the lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the
lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee
would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar
terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, the group makes
judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and necessary
adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease.

_(e)_ _Intangible assets_
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The
cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the
date of acquisition, if they satisfy the recognition criteria. Following initial recognition,
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful
lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets
with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite
useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period.

Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future
economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the
amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in
accounting estimates.

The useful economic lives of intangible assets with finite lives are as follow:

Customer lists 25 years
Databases 5 years
Contract costs 1 year
Software 6 years

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for
impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to
determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in
useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising
from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the

net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(f)_ _Research and development costs_
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable
and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible
assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied:
� it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available
for use;
� management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
� there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
� it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future
economic benefits;
� adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development
and to use or sell the software product are available; and
� the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be
reliably measured.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an
expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not
recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model
is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when
development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over
the period of expected future benefit. The current weighted average life of capitalised
development costs is 3 years (2019: 3 years).

_(g)_ _Goodwill_
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree
and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over
the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration
transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured
at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in
the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in
a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or
groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each
unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within
the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for

F - 166


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)_
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment
losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and
the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to
write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date
of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Computer equipment 3 years
Right-of-use assets over the period of lease
Fixtures and fittings 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate,
at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of
the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of
derecognition.

_(j)_ _Investment in subsidiaries_
Investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at cost, being either the value of the
capital injected into a subsidiary through subscription of shares or by way of a capital
contribution, or the amount of consideration paid to another group entity under common
control for the equity shares issued by the subsidiary. Subsequent to initial
measurement, the investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less impairment.

_(k)_ _Leases_
_Leases as a lessee_
The Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a lease if the contract
conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in
exchange for consideration.

On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability for all leases except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month
or less and leases of low-value assets.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any
initial direct costs incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are
not included in the lease liability and an estimate of the restoration costs required under
the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received. Depreciation on the right-ofuse asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of

F - 167


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset, the Group follows the policy for
property, plant and equipment, being cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease
payments over the lease term that are not paid at commencement date, discounted
using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(k)_ _Leases (continued)_
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments and corresponding adjustment of such
remeasurement is made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the
carrying value of right-of-use asset is reduced to zero.

The Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the
lease and non-lease components as a single lease commitment. The Group has
elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value items in profit or loss
on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

_Leases as a lessor_
When the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as a finance lease when,
the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the
underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted for as an operating lease on a
straight line basis through profit or loss.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with
reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to
the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies
the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

_(l)_ _Pension costs_
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged
to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit
expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

_(m)_ _Provisions for liabilities_
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

_(n)_ _Financial assets_
_Initial recognition and measurement - the Group determines the classification of its_
financial assets on initial recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial
recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and
the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade
receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the Group initially
measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at
fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.

F - 168


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

_Subsequent measurement - for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets_
held by the Group are classified in the following categories:

_1._ ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(n)_ _Financial assets (continued)_
� Financial assets at amortised cost – the Group measures financial assets at
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: (i) the asset is held within
a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash
flows; and (ii) based on the contractual terms, the expected cashflows are solely
payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.
� Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial assets
held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value
through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at
fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as
separate derivatives, other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss
are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in
fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Impairment of financial assets - the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit_
losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs
are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with
the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an
approximation of the original effective interest rate.

For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs.
Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a
loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has
established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience,
adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic
environment.

The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding
greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the
Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and
contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the
provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of
recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Group’s
intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities.

F - 169


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

_Derecognition - a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part_
of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the
Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when:

� The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
� The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has
assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay
to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(o)_ _Financial liabilities_
_Initial recognition and measurement - the Group determines the classification of its_
financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at
fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly
attributable transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement - the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their_
classification, as described below:

� Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition
as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging
relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement
of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

� Loans and borrowings - after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR
amortisation is included as finance expense in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income.

_Derecognition of financial liabilities - a liability is generally derecognised when the_
contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange
or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition
of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together
with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income.

_(p)_ _Fair value measurement of financial instruments_
When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the
Statement of Financial Position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active
markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the
discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from

F - 170


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

observable markets where possible. Judgements include considerations of inputs such
as liquidity risk, credit risk and the selection of appropriate discount curves, and other
market inputs.

_(q)_ _Classification of financial instruments_
An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial
asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual
arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The initial carrying value of a compound
instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity
components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating
the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between
the components on a relative fair value basis.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(r)_ _Foreign currency translation_
Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(‘the functional currency’).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity
using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where
items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income.

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the
financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On
consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars
at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of
comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition
are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot
rate of exchange at the reporting date.

_(s)_ _Taxation_
The tax expense for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax
is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are
charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged
or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity,
otherwise, income tax is recognised in profit or loss.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted for the financial year.

F - 171


-----

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2020 (Continued)**

Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except
for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,
carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax
rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled,
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of
Financial Position date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial
Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable
right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred
income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the
Company to make a single net payment.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(t)_ _Revenue recognition_
The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue comprises subscriptions
to information products, and research report and event revenues.

_Subscription revenue_
Revenue from subscription services is recognised evenly over the period of the
subscription.

_Research report and event revenues_
Revenue from research reports and events is recognised in the same accounting
period in which the report is published, or event is held.

_Incremental costs of obtaining contracts_
The Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers that
are directly associated with the contract as an asset if those costs are expected to be
recoverable and records them in “Intangible assets” in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position. Incremental costs of obtaining contracts are those costs that are
incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the
contract had not been obtained.

_(u)_ _New standards and interpretations_
_New standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2020_
The following amendments to standards have been adopted for the first time in these
financial statements:

Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 January 2020

Amendments to IFRS 3 - In October 2019, the IASB issued amendments to the
definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine
whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the
minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market

participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help
entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a
business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New
illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the
Group, but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business
combinations.

_New standards and interpretations effective after 1 January 2020_
Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial
statements are listed below. This listing is of relevant standards and interpretations
issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date.

1 January 2022

Amendments to IFRS 16 - In May 2020, IASB issued _COVID-19-Related Rent_
_Concessions_ _- Amendment to IFRS 16_ _Leases. The amendments provide relief to_
lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent
concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a practical
expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent
concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election
accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19 related rent
concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change
were not a lease modification.

The original amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1
June 2020. In March 2021, the IASB issued COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions
beyond 30 June 2021, which extended the availability of the practical expedient by one
year. Earlier application is permitted. The Group intends to adopt this amendment when
it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on the
consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 _Interest Rate_
_Benchmark Reform - Phase 2_    - The amendments provide temporary reliefs which
address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is
replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free rate (RFR).

The amendments include the following practical expedients:

� A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows
that are directly required by the reform, to be treated as changes to a floating
interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market rate of interest.
� Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations
and hedge documentation without hedging relationship being discontinued.
� Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately
identifiable requirement when an RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of
a risk component.

These amendments are effective for the annual period beginning on or after 1 January
2021. The amendments apply retrospectively and earlier application is permitted. The
Group is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of the amendments to the
standards.

Amendment to IFRS 9 _Financial Instruments - Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for_

includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are
substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include
only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid
or received by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. An entity applies the
amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the
beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment.

The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1
January 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendment
when it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on
the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

_(d)_ _Circumstances affecting future tax changes:_
The tax charge in future periods will be impacted by any changes to the corporation tax
rate in force in the countries in which the Group operates. There is a degree of
uncertainty over the level of the future tax rate, due to a combination of factors including
US tax reform, future BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) actions and the potential
impact of COVID-19 on tax rates internationally.

On 3 March 2021 the UK Government announced that legislation will be introduced in
the Finance Bill 2021 to increase the main rate of corporation tax to 25% with effect
from 1 April 2023. This change will impact the Group’s future tax charges and deferred
tax balances. The Group estimates that the remeasurement of its UK deferred tax
balances would result in a decrease to the Group tax charge of $0.3m in the year ended
31 December 2021.

9. INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS (Continued)

_Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment review_
The Group performed its annual impairment test in December 2020. The recoverable
amount is based either on cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by
senior management or observable EBITDA or revenue multiples as adjusted and applied
to the forecasted EBITDA.

The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future
growth rate of the revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the existing
customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales
to existing and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the
marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected
in the future. Where cashflow projections are used they are discounted using pre-tax
discount rates applied to cash flow projections between 8% and 10% and cash flows
beyond the projection period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate. No impairments
were indicated (2019: none indicated). Goodwill is allocated to one cash generating unit
(2019: one).

_Expected credit losses on trade receivables_
Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s
established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management.
Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are noninterest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix
below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for
groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation of
the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at the
reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic
conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at
least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between
economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected,
current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives
of the receivables.

Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade
receivables using a provision matrix:

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

_Financial risk_
The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include
credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk
management programme in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the
financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s
exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes
for measuring and managing the risk.

The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight
of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for
identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies
and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively.

(i) Credit risk
_Exposure to credit risk_
Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on
outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash
equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.

_Trade and other receivables_
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics
of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on
individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial
services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by
significant changes in that industry.

The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related
to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic
default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. The aging profile
and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements.

_Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_
Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions
with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or
institutions at any one time.

The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the
Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is
the carrying value of the financial assets.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations
as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure as far as
possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under
both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation.

It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at
all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements.

The following are the carrying values and the contractual cashflows of the financial
liabilities and long-term employee benefits, including estimated interest payments and
excluding the impact of netting agreements:

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will
fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and
interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial
instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to manage and
control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return
earned by the Group.

The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each
of which are dealt with as follows:

Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. Management requires all Group companies to manage their foreign
exchange risk against their functional currency.

The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from
financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no
hedging arrangements have been put in place.

The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the
Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the
Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall, the Group seeks to hedge its
operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each
currency and additionally financing any acquisitions of significant transactions in the
currency of the acquired entity or acquired asset.

The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated
in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position
date were as follows:

USD GBP EUR

Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. The table below
examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in LIBOR would have on
profit before tax over a one year period.

the external borrowings.

23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND
SECRETARY’S INTERESTS

The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Acuris Holdings Limited, a company
incorporated in England and Wales.

The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is Bessel Capital
S.ár.l, a company incorporated in Luxembourg.

The parent undertaking of the smallest and largest groups of undertakings for which
consolidated financial statements are prepared and of which the Company is a member
are Acuris Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales and ION
Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated in Ireland.

Neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor children, held
any interests in the shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any other group
undertaking, except as follows:

At the year end, Mr. A. Pignataro owned directly 100% (2019: 100%) of Bessel Capital
S.àr.l.

24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On 11 July 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the controlling interest in Mergermarket
Topco Limited (“Acuris”) for total consideration of $847.2m.

The identifiable net assets were included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position at their acquisition date fair value and there has been no changes to the
acquisition date fair values.
Transaction expenses of $6.8m related to the acquisition were charged in the
Consolidated Income Statement under operating expenses in the period. In valuing the
net assets of Acuris on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation
techniques, specifically:

1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty
payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the trademarks and
Information Technology being owned.
2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash
flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any
cash flows related to contributory assets.
3. Replacement Cost, which considers the value of databases owned by estimating
the costs that a market participant would incur to replace the asset.
4. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred
income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participant profit margin.

assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would
have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019. Since the

consolidated loss amounting to $62.0 in the consolidated income statement from this
acquisition.

25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE

On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt
facilities. The Company sold its holdings in Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l.
and Acuris Finance US, Inc to I-logic Technologies Bidco Limited. The sale was a
common control transaction which was undertaken by way of a share for share
exchange. Concurrent with the group reorganisation, the newly combined group
refinanced the existing debt facilities by drawing down a new debt facility to repay its
existing debt facilities. The new debt extends the maturity of both the USD and Euro
facilities to 16 February 2028.

26. REVISIONS TO THE 2020 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

The annual report and financial statements have been revised and will be resubmitted
to the UK Companies House and replace the original annual report and financial
statements that were approved by the Directors on 11 April 2021. This revised annual
report and financial statements are now the statutory financial statements of the Group
for the period ended 31 December 2020. The revised annual report and financial
statements have been prepared as at the date of the original annual report and financial
statements and not as at the date of revision and accordingly do not deal with events
between those dates. A revision by replacement was deemed necessary after it was
identified that the Group had not recognised deferred tax assets.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2020, the Group did not recognise deferred
tax assets associated with interest on borrowings as restricted by the Corporate Interest
Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom (UK) as
management believed that there was not sufficient future taxable income from which
the restricted interest and tax losses could be utilised. However, the Group had not
considered the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on
acquisition of Acuris Group in 2019. In addition, the Group revisited the offsetting of its
outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As a consequence,
deferred tax liabilities were overstated and the following amendments to the original
annual accounts were made in these revised financial statements:

2019 to correct those financial statements. The comparative information included in
these financial statements includes the information from the revised financial
statements for the period ended 31 December 2019 as shown in the above table.

**DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT RELATING TO THE REVISED ANNUAL ACCOUNTS**
**for the period ended 31 December 2019**

The directors present herewith their revised annual accounts which comprise the revised
strategic report (‘strategic report’), revised directors’ report (‘directors’ report’) and revised
audited consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial
statements”) of Acuris International Limited (“the Company”) for the financial period ended 31
December 2019 in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and SI
2008/373, The Companies (Revision of Defective Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.
These revised annual accounts replace the original annual accounts of the Company for the
financial period ended 31 December 2019 which were approved on 21 July 2020 and should
now represent the statutory accounts of the Company for that financial period. The revised
strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared as at the date of the original annual accounts and not as at the date of the
revision hence any events in between those dates have not been dealt with in the revised
strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements.
The original strategic report, original directors’ report and original consolidated financial
statements did not comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the
recognition of deferred tax assets associated with interest on borrowings as restricted by the
Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom
as management believed that there wasn’t sufficient future taxable income from which the
restricted interest and operating losses could be utilised. However, management had not
considered the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of
Mergermarket Topco Limited and subsidiaries (“Acuris Group”). In addition, the Group revisited
the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As a result,
amendments to the original annual accounts have been made. Refer to Note 26 to the financial
statements for disclosure of the amendments to the revised annual accounts.

This revised 2019 annual accounts were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for
issue on 20 January 2022. They were signed on behalf by:

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the period ended 31 December 2019**

The directors present herewith the Strategic Report, the Directors’ Report and the audited
consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”)
for the period ended 31 December 2019.

_PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS_
The principal activity of Acuris International Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the
“Group”) is to provide financial information services, analysis and data to the advisory,
corporate and financial communities. The Group primarily generates revenue from subscription
services and expects to continue to provide these services in the future.

The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited,
the holding company of the Acuris group on 11 July 2019.

_Financial Performance Indicators_
The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation) and Profit on Ordinary Activities after
Taxation.

_Revenue_
The Group’s total revenue was $136.2 million for the period.

_EBITDA_
Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation was $32.2 million in the period.

_Loss on Ordinary Activities after Taxation_
Loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the period ended 31 December 2019 was
$55.6 million.

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_
The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are:

� The Group derives the majority of its revenues from customers in the financial services
industry. The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be
adversely affected by significant changes in that industry as well as consolidation
amongst the Group’s customers.
� Failure to provide services to the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue
to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation;
� The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could
obtain and use the Group’s technology without authorisation;
� The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property
or proprietary rights of others;

F - 209


-----

**STRATEGIC REPORT**
**for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

_PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (Continued)_
� The Group has funded its activities through operating cash flows and bank borrowings.
The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and
sales revenues will fund its existing operations and payment obligations. However, if
the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not
sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional financing which
may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of financial
instruments is discussed in note 15.

The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks
and uncertainties. The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and
proactively limit the associated risks.

_SECTION 172 STATEMENT_
The Directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way
which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company
for the benefit of its members and key stakeholders. The directors when making key decisions
for the Company have had considered the impact of their decisions to the Company’s key
stakeholders and to wider society by continuing to facilitate the critical processes within our
clients’ businesses, and by focusing on innovation in the capital markets in order to contribute
to continuous process improvement for our clients.

One of Group’s core values is to long term thinking and building long-term sustainable
relationships with customers. Acuris’s offerings help our customers to find business
opportunities, improve decision-making, increase efficiency and empower their people. This is
achieved by partnering with our customers to enable them to find insights that lead to business
opportunities as well as strengthen compliance and risk management with in depth regulatory
insights.

The Company recognises its employees are a critical success factor for the Company and
seeks to assist employees to succeed through a positive culture and continuous
improvement. There are a number of measures in place to keep employees up to date on
recent developments of the company and allow employee engagement with senior
management, through face to face meetings and electronic media.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the period ended 31 December 2019**

The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements
(“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the period ended 31
December 2019.

_DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_
The names of the directors who served at any time during the financial year are as listed on
page 2.

The interests of the directors and company secretary in shares of the company or other group
companies are set out in note 23 to the financial statements.

_DIVIDENDS_
No dividends were declared in the year.

_RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_
The Group has invested in the development of new and existing products with considerable
effort applied by the technical and software development teams. As set out in note 1(f), when
certain criteria are met the costs are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the
useful life of the asset, currently considered to be 3 years. These capitalised development costs
are shown in note 9. All other development costs are expensed as incurred.

_GOING CONCERN_
Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, including the expected
impact of COVID-19, and its current financial position, the directors are satisfied that the Group
has adequate financial resources to continue to manage its business risks successfully and to
remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the report and accounts.

_FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS_
The Group’s financial risk management objective is to identify financial risks and implement
suitable risk reducing measures where appropriate.

In implementing this objective, Group policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash amounts are
held to meet all working capital requirements and sufficient committed borrowing facilities are
available to meet longer term requirements.

The Group is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. For information
on these risks please refer to note 15.

_EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_
Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is causing
economic disruptions in most countries. Various measures have been taken by Governments
around the world to contain the virus which have had a significant impact on global economic
activity.

The Group’s products are primarily delivered by electronic means enabling it to continue to
service its customers in the current climate. The Group has moved to remote working
arrangements which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of staff and to enable the
business to operate with minimal impact.

F - 211


-----

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the period ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

_EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE (Continued)_
A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with customers
with the services provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence limited immediate
impact is expected on the Group’s revenue stream. Given the nature of the outbreak and the
on-going developments, at this time it is not possible to estimate the overall future impact to the
Group.

_DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THE AUDITOR_
So far as each person who was a director at the date of approving this report is aware, there is
no relevant audit information, being information needed by the auditor in connection with
preparing their report, of which the auditor is unaware. Having made enquiries of fellow
directors and the Company’s auditor, each director has taken all the steps that he is obliged to
take as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the auditor is aware of that information.

_DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT_
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report and
the Group and Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
regulations.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for
each financial year. Under that law they have elected to prepare the Group financial statements
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law, and have elected to
prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and
applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101).

Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company
and of their profit or loss for that year. In preparing each of the Group and Company financial
statements, the directors are required to:

� select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
� make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;
� for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
� for the Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101, have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
� assess the Group and Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as
applicable, matters related to going concerns; and
� use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the
Group or the Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do
so.

**DIRECTORS’ REPORT**
**for the period ended 31 December 2019 (Continued)**

_DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES STATEMENT (Continued)_
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to
show and explain the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any
time the financial position of the company and enable them to ensure that its financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control
as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have a general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED**

**Opinion**
We have audited the revised financial statements of Acuris International Limited (‘the parent
company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the period ended 31 December 2019 which
comprise the Consolidated Statement Of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement
Of Financial Position, the Company Statement Of Financial Position, the Consolidated
Statement Of Changes In Equity, the Company Statement Of Changes In Equity, the
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 27, including a summary of
significant accounting policies.

These revised financial statements replace the original financial statements approved by the
directors on 21 July 2020. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the revised group financial statements is applicable law and International
Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards,
including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice).

The revised financial statements have been prepared under The Companies (Revision of
Defective Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 and accordingly do not take account of
events which have taken place after the date on which the original financial statements were
approved.

In our opinion:

� the revised financial statements give a true and fair view, seen as at the date the original
financial statements of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December
2019 and of the group’s loss for the period then ended;

� the revised group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with
International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies
Act 2006, seen as at the date the original financial statements were approved;

� the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance in
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

� the revised financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the Companies Act 2006 as they have effect under the Companies (Revision of
Defective Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs
(UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in
the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the revised financial statements section of our report
below. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the revised financial statements in the UK,
including the FRC’s Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a
basis for our opinion.

**Emphasis of matter – revision of deferred tax assets**

We draw attention to note 26 to these revised financial statements which describes the need
for revision due to the incorrect accounting of deferred tax assets under IAS12. The original
financial statements were approved on 21 July 2020 and our previous report was signed on 28

July 2020. We have not performed a subsequent events review for the period from the date of
our previous report to the date of this report. Our opinion is not modified in this respect.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED (Continued)**

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK)
require us to report to you where:

� the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the revised
financial statements is not appropriate; or
� the directors have not disclosed in the revised financial statements any identified material
uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group’s or the parent company’s
ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least
twelve months from the date when the original financial statements were authorised for
issue.

**Other information**
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the
revised financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for
the other information.

Our opinion on the revised financial statements does not cover the other information and,
except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the revised financial statements, our responsibility is to read the
other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the revised financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or
apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the revised financial statements or a material misstatement of the other
information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material
misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

� the information given in the revised strategic report and the revised directors’ report for the
financial period for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the
revised financial statements; and

� the revised strategic report and revised directors’ report have been prepared in accordance
with applicable legal requirements.

In our opinion, the original financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 failed to
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in respects identified by the directors
in the statement contained in note 26 of these revised financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its
environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements
in the revised strategic report or revised directors’ report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies
Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

� adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

F - 216

F - 217


-----

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ACURIS INTERNATIONAL**
**LIMITED (Continued)**

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception (continued)**

� the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records
and returns; or
� certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
� we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 6, the
directors are responsible for the preparation of the revised financial statements and for being
satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors
determine is necessary to enable the preparation of revised financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group’s
and the parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable,
matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the
directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or
have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the revised financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the revised financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and
to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of
assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will
always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these revised
financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the revised financial statements is
located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at
https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s
report.

We are also required to report whether in our opinion the original financial statements failed to
comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in the respects identified by the
directors. The audit of revised financial statements includes the performance of procedures to
assess whether the revisions made by the directors are appropriate and have been properly
made.

This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might
state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or
assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES

_(a)_ _General information_
The financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 20
January 2022. Acuris International Limited is a private limited company incorporated in
England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, 2[nd] Floor,
London, EC4R 1BE, United Kingdom. The principal activities of the Company and its
subsidiaries are described in the Strategic Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is
disclosed in note 23.

_(b)_ _Basis of preparation_
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the EU. IFRS
as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS as adopted by the EU.

The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the
following disclosures:

         - Statement of Cash Flows;

         - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;

         - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements;

         - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures;

         - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and

         - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.

The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006
from presenting their Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial
statements and the Company financial statements.

The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a
historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair
value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is also
the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand
($’000), except where otherwise indicated.

The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the
directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet
its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the
financial statements, considering the below.

A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from subscription contracts with
customers, which gives a highly visible income stream for the Group. The Group's
forecasts and projections, including reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19,
show that the Group will continue to generate positive operating cash flows to fund both
operations and financing requirements of the Group.

The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and for this reason no comparative
information is presented.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company
and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2019.

Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the
subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for
common control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is
exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and
has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the
acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets
acquired.

Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end
that differs from that of the company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial
statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest
financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, together with management
accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2019. Financial statements of
subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group
balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group
transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation.

The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under
the principle of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented
as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under
common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the
carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal
value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital
redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves.

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities
as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues
and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual
outcomes could differ from those estimates.

The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most
significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements:

(i) _Development costs: The Group capitalises development costs for development_
projects in accordance with their accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is
based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is
confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes
assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the
expected period of benefits.

(ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires_
certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax
outcome may not be certain.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)_

The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also
requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of
those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included in the
consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the
final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in
the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals.

(iii) _Provisions and accruals:_ In determining the fair value of the provision,
assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the
obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time
value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate
that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

(iv) _Provision for doubtful debts:_ For trade receivables, the Group uses a provision
matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based
on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates
by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement
exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates,
current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default
rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the
future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail.

(v) _Business combinations:_ As part of a business combination the assets and
liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of
Financial position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements
used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business
combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group,
some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits
do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of
goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these
intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash
flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate.
In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are
subject to annual impairment testing. Please see note 10 and 24 for further details.

(vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial_
measurement of the lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the
lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the
lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee
would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar
value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar
terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, the group makes
judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and necessary
adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease, as set out above.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(e)_ _Intangible assets_
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The
cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the
date of acquisition, if they satisfy the separation criteria. Following initial recognition,
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated
impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised
development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful
lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets
with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for
impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a
finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the
expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits
embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or
method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.

Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for
impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to
determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in
useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising
from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the
net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the
Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. The useful
economic life of intangible assets is between 1 and 25 years.

_(f)_ _Research and development costs_
Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable
and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible
assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied:

� it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available
for use;
� management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it;
� there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
� it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future
economic benefits;
� adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development
and to use or sell the software product are available; and
� the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be
reliably measured.

Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an
expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not
recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.

Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model
is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation

F - 230

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when
development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over
the period of expected future benefit, currently considered to be 3 years.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(g)_ _Goodwill_
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the
consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree
and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over
the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration
transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured
at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in
the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement
of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in
a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or
groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level
within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or
changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment.

_(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for
an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount
is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its
value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not
generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups
of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment
losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and
the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to
write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date
of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:

Computer equipment 3 years
Right of use assets Over the period of the lease
Fixtures and fittings 5 years

The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate,
at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of
the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of
derecognition.

**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(j)_ _Leases_
_Leases as a lessee - the Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a_
lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration.

On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a
lease liability for all leases except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month
or less and leases of low-value assets.

The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any
initial direct costs incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are
not included in the lease liability and an estimate of the restoration costs required under
the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received. Depreciation on the right-ofuse asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of
subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset the Group follows the policy of
property, plant and equipment, being cost less accumulated depreciation and
accumulated impairment losses.

The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease
payments over the lease term that are not paid at commencement date, discounted
using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate basis. It is remeasured
when there is a change in future lease payments with a corresponding adjustment
made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-ofuse asset is reduced to zero.

The Group has elected to account for short-term leases in profit or loss on a straight
line basis over the lease term.

_Leases as a lessor - when the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as_
a finance lease when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted for as an operating
lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease
and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with
reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to
the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies
the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.

_(k)_ _Pension costs_
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged
to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit
expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(l)_ _Provisions for liabilities_
A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required
to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a
current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

_(m)_ _Financial assets_
_Initial recognition and measurement - the Group determines the classification of its_
financial assets on initial recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial
recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and
the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade
receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group
has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its
fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss,
transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement - for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets_
held by the Group are classified in the following categories:

� Financial assets at amortised costs – the Group measures financial assets at
amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met; (i) the asset is held within
a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash
flows, and (ii) based on the contractual terms the expected cashflows are solely
payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial
measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is
calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees
or costs that are an integral part of the EIR.

� Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial assets
held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value
through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at
fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as
separate derivatives other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss;
are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in
fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Impairment of financial assets - the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit_
losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs
are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with
the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an
approximation of the original effective interest rate.

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(m)_ _Financial assets (Continued)_

For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in
calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but
instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date.
The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss
experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the
economic environment.

The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding
greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the
Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and
contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the
provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of
recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Group’s
intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities.

_Derecognition - a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or_
part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from
the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when:

� The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or

� The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has
assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay
to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has
transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has
neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset,
but has transferred control of the asset.

_(n)_ _Financial liabilities_
_Initial recognition and measurement - the Company determines the classification of its_
financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at
fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly
attributable transaction costs.

_Subsequent measurement - the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their_
classification, as described below:

� Loans and borrowings - after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on
acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR
amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income.

� Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial
liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition
as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging

relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9,
as outlined above. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

_(n)_ _Financial liabilities (Continued)_

in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value
presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

_Derecognition of financial liabilities - a liability is generally derecognised when the_
contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing
financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different
terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange
or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition
of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together
with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive
Income.

_(o)_ _Classification of financial instruments_
An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial
asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual
arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The initial carrying value of a compound
instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity
components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating
the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between
the components on a relative fair value basis.

_(p)_ _Foreign currency translation_
Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured
using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates
(‘the functional currency’).

Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the
exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are
re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in
the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On
consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars
at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of
comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are
recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value
adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition

F - 237

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot
rate of exchange at the reporting date.

_(q)_ _Taxation_
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is
charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are
charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged
or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in profit or loss.

Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax
rates and laws that have been enacted for the period.

Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except
for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that
taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences,
carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax
rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled,
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of
Financial Position date.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial
Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable
right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred
income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group
to make a single net payment.

_(r)_ _Revenue recognition_
The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to
customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue comprises subscriptions
to information products, and research report and event revenues.

_Subscription revenues_
Revenue from subscription services is recognised evenly over the period of the
subscription.

_Research report and event revenues_
Revenue from research reports and events is recognised in the same accounting
period in which the report is published or event is held.

_(s)_ _New standards and interpretations_

Relevant standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective up to the date of
issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. The Group intends to
adopt these standards when they become effective.

Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 January 2020

Amendments to IFRS 3 - In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to the
definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine
whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the
minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market
participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help
entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a
business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New
illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments.

The Group intends to adopt the amendments to IFRS 3 when they become effective.
Since the amendments apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur
on or after the date of first application, the Group will not be affected by these
amendments on the date of transition.

2. REVENUE

The revenue for the period was derived from the Group’s principal activity and is
attributable to geographical markets as follows:

revenue streams. As such, substantially all deferred revenue at the end of an
accounting year will be recognised in the following year.

_Expected credit losses on trade receivables_

Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established
policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding
customer receivables and contract assets are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are
non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days.

An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix
below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due and the
calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available
at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future
economic conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period
of 2 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between
economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected,
current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives
of the receivables.

Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade
receivables and contract assets using a provision matrix:

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

_Financial risk_
The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include
credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk
management program in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the
financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s
exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes
for measuring and managing the risk.

The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight
of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for
identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies
and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively.

(i) Credit risk
_Exposure to credit risk_
Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on
outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash
equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions.

_Trade and other receivables_
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics
of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on
individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial
services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by
significant changes in that industry.

The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related
to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic
default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. An impairment
analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure
expected credit losses, as described in note 1(m) and in note 12 to the financial
statements. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the
financial statements.

_Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_
Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions
with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or
institutions at any one time.

The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the
Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is
the carrying value of the assets.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(ii) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations
as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as
possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under
both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking
damage to the Group’s reputation.

It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at
all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements.

The following are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and long term
employment benefits, including estimated interest payments excluding the impact of
netting agreements:

(iii) Market risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument
will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates,
and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of
financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to
manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while
optimising the return earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk
namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are dealt with as follows:

Currency risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies. Management requires all Group entities to manage their foreign exchange
risk against their functional currency.

The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from
financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no
hedging arrangements have been put in place.

The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the
Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and
the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall the Group seeks to hedge
its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each
currency.

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(iii) Market risk (Continued)

Currency risk (Continued)
The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated
in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position
date were as follows:

USD GBP EUR
At 31 December 2019 _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_

Cash and cash equivalents 3,097 1,593 100
Trade and other receivables 4,531 493 496
Debt     -     - (753,803)

Gross Statement of Financial Position
exposure 7,628 2,086 (753,207)

A 5% strengthening or weakening of the exchange rates in respect of the translation of
amounts not denominated in the functional currency of relevant entities into the
functional currency would impact on the profit or loss over a one year period by the
amounts shown below. This assumes that all other variables remain constant.

USD GBP EUR

Impact on profit before tax: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_

Impact of 5% strengthening 401 110 (39,642)

Impact of 5% weakening -363 -99 35,867

Interest rate risk
The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. At 31
December 2019, the interest on the USD external borrowings was based on USD Libor
plus a margin of 7.75% and the interest on EUR external borrowings was based on
Euribor plus a margin of 7.75%. The interest rate profile of the borrowings is:

Floating Fixed
Interest Rate Interest Rate
_$’m_ _$’m_
External borrowings:

During the period, the Euribor rate remained at 0% on the Group’s EUR denominated
debt.

**NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**
**31 December 2019 (Continued)**

15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued)

(iv) Market risk (Continued)

During the period, the USD Libor rate ranged from 2% to 2.3% on the Group’s US Dollar
denominated debt. The table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase
or decrease in Libor would have on profit before tax over a one year period:

_$’000_
Increase/(decrease) on profit before tax:

Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR (6.2)
Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR 6.2

_Fair values and levelling_
For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities the carrying amounts are
reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of
cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current
liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of
these instruments.

Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are
determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest
rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of
the external borrowings.

16. LEASES

The Group leases land and buildings for its office space. The leases of office space
typically run for a period between 1 and 10 years.

Refer to note 15(ii) for maturity analysis of lease liabilities and to note 11 for roll forward
of right-of-use asset.

17. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES (Continued)

Trade creditors and amounts due to fellow subsidiary undertakings are stated at
amortised cost, which approximates fair value given the short-term nature of these
liabilities. Trade and other payables are due within one year, unsecured and interest
free.

Lease liabilities relate to the recognition, over the lease term, of future lease payments
discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

18. DIVIDENDS

No dividends were paid during the period ended 31 December 2019 and none have
been announced as at the date of signing these financial statements.

23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND
SECRETARY’S INTERESTS

The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Acuris Holdings Limited, a company
incorporated in England.

The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is ITT S.àr.l., a
company incorporated in Luxembourg.

At the year end, neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor
children, held any interests in the shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any
other group undertaking, except as follows:

Mr. A. Pignataro owned indirectly 100% of ITT S.àr.l.

24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

On 11 July 2019, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Mergermarket Topco
Limited (“Acuris”) for total consideration of $847.2m.

The identifiable net assets have been included in the Consolidated Statement of
Financial Position at their provisional acquisition date fair value. The initial assignment
of fair value to identifiable net assets acquired and the consideration paid has been
performed on a provisional basis given the timing of closure of these transactions. Any
amendments to these fair values within the twelve month timeframe from the date of
acquisition will be disclosable in the 2020 Annual Report as stipulated by IFRS 3.

Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated
Income Statement in the period. In valuing the net assets of Acuris on acquisition the
Group has utilised market standard valuation techniques, specifically:

1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty
payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the trademarks and
Information Technology being owned.
2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net
cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding
any cash flows related to contributory assets.
3. Replacement Cost, which considers the value of databases owned by estimating
the costs that a market participant would incur to replace the asset.
4. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred
income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, management estimate that
consolidated revenue would have been $265.4m and consolidated loss before tax for
the year would have been $136.7m. In determining these amounts management has
assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would
have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019.

25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE

Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is
causing economic disruptions in most countries. Various measures have been taken by
Governments around the world to contain the virus which have had a significant impact
on global economic activity.

The Group’s products are primarily delivered by electronic means enabling it to continue
to service its customers in the current climate. The Group has moved to remote working
arrangements which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of staff and to enable
the business to operate with minimal impact.

A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with
customers with the services provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence
limited immediate impact is expected on the Group’s revenue stream. Given the nature
of the outbreak and the on-going developments, at this time it is not possible to estimate
the overall future impact to the Group.

26. REVISIONS TO THE 2019 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS

The annual report and financial statements have been revised and will be resubmitted
to the UK Companies House and replace the original annual report and financial
statements that were approved by the Directors on 21 July 2020. This revised annual
report and financial statements are now the statutory financial statements of the Group
for the period ended 31 December 2019. The revised annual report and financial
statements have been prepared as at the date of the original annual report and financial
statements and not as at the date of revision and accordingly do not deal with events
between those dates. A revision by replacement was deemed necessary after it was
identified that the Group had not recognised deferred tax assets.

For the financial period ended 31 December 2019, the Group did not recognise deferred
tax assets associated with interest on borrowings (pre and post-acquisition of Acuris
Group) as restricted by the Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses
carried forward in the United Kingdom as management believed that there was not
sufficient future taxable income from which the restricted interest and tax losses could
be utilised. However, the Group had not considered the deferred tax liability associated
with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of Acuris Group. In addition, the Group
revisited the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax
liabilities. As a consequence, Goodwill on acquisition and deferred tax liabilities were
overstated and the following amendments to the original annual accounts were made in
these revised financial statements:
