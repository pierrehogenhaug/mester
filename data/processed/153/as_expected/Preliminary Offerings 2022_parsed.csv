In this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we will provide a discussion of key line items from Acuris International Limited’s unaudited income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 (prepared based on unaudited management information for illustrative purposes only, as compared to Acuris International Limited’s audited income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020 that forms part of the Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.6,Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations,4.6.3,Impact of IFRS 16,"In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 (Leases), which requires most leases to be recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on balance sheets for lessees, thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 (Leases) and related interpretations. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For such contracts, IFRS 16 requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated and the liability accrues interest. This results in a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when the lessee pays constant annual rentals. The Parent Guarantor implemented IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019 and applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach. On transition to IFRS 16, the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries recognized $12.6 million of right-of-use assets and $16.9 million lease liabilities. See note 1(s) to the FY 2019 Financial Statements. The FY 2018 Financial Statements have not been restated to take into account IFRS 16. Acuris International Limited implemented IFRS 16 from its incorporation and the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Acuris 2019 Financial Statements and Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements reflect the requirements of IFRS 16.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,4,CERTAIN DEFINITIONS,4.7,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,4.7.1,,"Certain financial measures and ratios related thereto in this Offering Memorandum, including EBITDA, EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses), EBITDA Margin (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other Gains), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Capital expenditures, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop), Recurring Revenue and Non-Recurring Revenue as a percentage of total revenue, and capital expenditures (collectively, the “Non**IFRS Metrics”), are not specifically defined under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. These measures are presented in this Offering Memorandum because we use them to monitor our financial and operating performance and believe they and similar measures are widely used in our industry as a means of evaluating a company’s financial and operating performance and financing structure. We believe these measures enhance the investor’s understanding of our indebtedness and our ability to fund our ongoing operations, make capital expenditures and meet and service our obligations. However, there are ----- no generally accepted accounting principles governing the calculation of non-IFRS financial and operating measures, and other companies may calculate such measures differently or may use such measures for different purposes than we do and such measures should therefore not be used to compare us against another company. We define the Non-IFRS Metrics as follows: “EBITDA” means earnings before net interest and finance cost, tax and depreciation and amortization. “EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as EBITDA excluding foreign exchange (gains)/losses. “EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as EBITDA excluding foreign exchange (gains)/losses, (gains)/losses on assignment of lease and (gains)/losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment. “EBITDA Margin (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other Gains)” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) divided by Revenue. “Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) excluding headcount- and staff-related costs and other expenses. “Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. “Capital expenditures” means capital expenditures other than capitalized development costs. “Pro Forma Combined EBITDA” is calculated as loss before taxation, adding back tax on loss, net interest and finance cost, depreciation of property, plant & equipment and amortization of intangible assets, in each case for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Acuris Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020. Pro Forma Combined EBITDA is derived from the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information set out in “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” “Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined EBITDA excluding foreign exchange (gains)/losses on a pro forma combined basis after giving effect to the Acuris Acquisition as if it occurred on January 1, 2020. “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange (Gains)/Losses and Other (Gains)/Losses) after adding back head-count- and staff-related cost savings and other expenses. “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA divided by pro forma combined revenue. “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to certain synergies and cost savings. “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) divided by pro forma combined revenue. “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition, using estimated adjusted EBITDA of Backstop for the year ended December 31, 2021, as adjusted for pro forma synergies expected to be achieved in the next 24 months. “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop)” is calculated as Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) divided by pro forma revenue reflecting the Backstop Acquisition. “Recurring Revenue” means license revenue recognized over time and revenue from post-contractual support. “Non-Recurring Revenue” means revenue recognized at a point in time and also includes, in the case of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries, professional services revenue. See “Summary Historical Financial and Other Data of the Parent Guarantor,” “Summary Historical Financial and other Data of _Acuris International Limited” and “Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information” for a more detailed explanation_ of the Non-IFRS Metrics and how they are calculated. ----- These Non-IFRS Metrics and other non-IFRS measures are used by different companies for differing purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the particular circumstances of those companies. You should exercise caution in comparing these measures reported by us to such measures or other similar measures as reported by other companies. An investor should not consider the Non-IFRS Metrics and other non-IFRS measures (a) as a substitute for operating results (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of our operating performance, (b) as a substitute for cash flow from or used in operating, investing and financing activities (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of our ability to meet cash needs or (c) as a substitute for any other measure of performance under IFRS. These measures may not be indicative of our historical operating results or financial position and such measures are not meant to be predictive of our future results or financial position. The non-IFRS financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the reporting requirements of the SEC and will not be subject to review by the SEC. Our management believes this information, along with comparable IFRS measures, is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance in the periods presented, and we believe it presents a helpful measure of financial performance between periods by excluding the effect of certain non-operational items or items we do not believe represent the future costs and run-rate performance of our business. Nonetheless, the adjustments included in our Non-IFRS Metrics, in some cases, give effect to assumed synergies and savings that have not yet been achieved, and there is no assurance that we will achieve the benefit of such synergies and savings in the future. Even though the Non-IFRS Metrics and other non-IFRS financial measures are used by management to assess our financial position, financial results and liquidity and these types of measures are commonly used by investors, they have important limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial position or results of operations as reported under IFRS. They may also be different from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Some of the limitations of Non-IFRS Metrics are: � they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital commitments; � they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; � they do not reflect any cash income taxes that we may be required to pay; � they are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our consolidated income statement; � they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations; � they give effect, in some cases, to the benefit of assumed earnings, synergies and cost savings that have not yet been realized and may not be realized in the future; � assets are depreciated or amortized over differing estimated useful lives and often have to be replaced in the future, and these measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and � other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the financial measures Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop), as they are based in part on management’s assumptions regarding the future impact of cost savings and other actions that have not yet been fully implemented. There is a risk that the synergies that we seek to achieve may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe and that the magnitude of cost savings may be less than expected. In addition, our Independent Auditors have not examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to Recurring Revenue, Non-Recurring Revenue, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including Backstop) and related margins, and accordingly, express no opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to these non-IFRS measures. Furthermore, our Independent Auditors make no comment as to the reasonableness, appropriateness, or the achievability of management’s assumptions regarding cost savings, other actions, synergies and the EBITDA expected to be generated by Backstop. ----- Because of these limitations, the Non-IFRS Metrics should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our IFRS results and using these non-IFRS measures only to supplement your evaluation of our performance. For a description of how our Non-IFRS Metrics are calculated from our Historical Financial Statements and a reconciliation to our results for the period presented in this Offering Memorandum and a calculation of our other Non-IFRS Metrics, see “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data of the Parent Guarantor—Other Financial Data,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our Historical Financial Statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information on an as adjusted basis to reflect the Offering, as if it had occurred on September 30, 2021. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Other Data of _the Parent Guarantor—Other Financial Data” and “Capitalization.” The unaudited as adjusted financial information has been_ prepared for illustrative purposes only and does not represent what our actual results would have been had the offering of the New Notes occurred on such dates nor do they purport to project our financial position or finance costs or other as adjusted financial ratios at any future date. The unaudited as adjusted financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting standards.

Following the combination of Dealogic and Acuris, we have an extensive portfolio of leading brands spanning various industries and geographies, covering a vast spectrum of capabilities to gather, analyze, distribute and harness market data and intelligence. 3 ----- Our Dealogic offering provides customers with market-leading integrated data, analysis and technology to help them improve productivity and profitability and facilitate collaboration across a global network to manage resources and target opportunities. Transforming primary markets through digitization and automation, Dealogic is an established leader in its space, particularly for over 600 banking and buyside/hedge fund customers, who accounted for 37% and 32% of Dealogic’s customer base, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, with legal and other advisers, corporates and private equity firms accounting for 15%, 12% and 3%, respectively.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.2,Uniquely positioned in large and growing global financial data and analytics markets,"We operate in a large and growing global market for financial data and analytics, driven by an increasing demand for actionable, real-time information, intelligence and insights to maintain and improve competitiveness. Our unique and comprehensive multibrand offering across Dealogic and Acuris software and services positions us strongly to address our customers’ market intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. See “Business—Our Content, Technology and Services.” We believe there are compelling growth opportunities in this space. According to management estimates based on external sources, the total addressable market for financial information was estimated to be approximately $33 billion in 2019 and was expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% between 2019 and 2022 following years of consistent growth. We anticipate that the global market for financial data, intelligence and analytics will benefit from several trends, including: (i) rapidly evolving regulatory requirements for financial institutions and corporates, including requirements to report more frequently and requirements relating to risk management and real-time tracking, (ii) the growing complexity and speed of global financial markets fueling the demand for real-time data and analytics and the need to proactively manage risk, (iii) rising demand for personalized, targeted market intelligence and analytical tools and (iv) the increasing adoption of technology, natural language processing and AI-driven solutions to improve efficiency. The volatile market environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the need to strictly and reliably monitor trades and transactions and manage risks, creating an environment that we expect would be beneficial to the financial data and analytics market.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.3,"Diversified, loyal customers cultivated through differentiated long-term commercial model","We have a large and expanding customer base, including blue-chip institutions across diversified end markets, and a strong, longstanding presence among financial institutions. We serve over 6,000 customers (including customers added through the Backstop Acquisition) and over 150,000 users, including (i) investment banks (excluding sales, trading and research), (ii) legal and other advisors, (iii) buyside/hedge fund customers (iv) sales trading and research units at investment banks, (v) corporates and (vi) private equity firms. These categories of customers contributed 36%, 20%, 16%, 12%, 10% and 6% of our pro forma combined revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our customers are spread globally, with revenue from EMEA, the U.S and APAC accounting for 42%, 40% and 18% of our revenue, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma combined basis. This diversity of customers reduces our dependence on any factors or trends specific to a single industry, region or customer size. Our products are also embedded in subscriber workflows and are mission-critical to originating opportunities for our customers and driving key decisions relating to M&A transactions and equity issuances across a range of markets. This characteristic, along with our focus on long-term contracts and our customers’ needs, has resulted in our high customer retention rate of 95% on a pro forma combined basis as of September 30, 2021. This has also resulted in long-standing customer relationships. For Dealogic, the top 10 customers have been with us for over 30 years, the top 11 to 50 customers have been with us for over 25 years and the top 51 to 150 customers have been with us for over 17 years.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strengths,9.3.4,"Attractive financial profile with highly visible revenue, high margins and robust cash flow generation","We derive most of our revenue from long-term subscription-based license contracts, which have provided us with highly visible revenue streams. Our standard contract for new customers is for a term of one to five years and we consistently aim to improve our contract terms at renewal. Our Weighted Average Contract Term was 2.26 years and our customer retention rate was 95% as of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021 on a pro forma combined basis. On a pro forma combined basis, our Recurring Revenue accounted for 90% (91% after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. We also benefit from strong and stable margins, with a Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin (with Combination Synergies including Backstop) of 72% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021. In addition to growing Recurring Revenue, lower operating costs through continuous cost optimization efforts have contributed to our industry-leading and consistent profitability. We enjoy strong cash flow generation and maintain a prudent amount of leverage, with low capital expenditures and structurally negative working capital due to our billings for subscriptions being made annually in advance. Our net cash inflow from operating activities as a percentage of Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA was 109% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Our proprietary software, data and analysis and workflow management tools are essential to key decision-makers and participants in the global financial markets, including investors, issuers, investment banks and legal and other advisors. We believe that our business has been historically resilient during downturns because of the mission-critical nature of our software and services to our customers, in particular during times of market volatility, and the ability of our software to save costs and drive operational efficiencies. We believe that our multi-brand software portfolio, which we can tailor to the needs of a broad range of customers in size and complexity, is a key reason for our competitive success. We continuously innovate our software and build out complementary products and modules that integrate seamlessly with our main software, thereby delivering additional incremental value to our customers. For instance, Selerity, our proprietary AI technology acquired in 2019, is catalyzing the development of our nextgeneration products and is bringing machine-learning capabilities to our systems. Also, in 2020, we released a new entitlements platform and data portal, nearly doubled the number of our public APIs from 7 to 13 and added $6.8 million of ACV and $7.7 million of TCV in new API sales from 146 new clients. As a result of this broad portfolio and clear brand positioning, we are able to serve customers with a variety of market intelligence and analytics needs across any use case, region or industry. In addition, as our customers grow in size and complexity, we are able to continue to provide them with the right level of software to meet their evolving needs.

We deploy a dual track strategy of acquisition and organic growth, with our acquisitions geared towards bridging the gaps in our functional footprint or expanding our addressable market segments while we constantly attempt to innovate and improve both acquired and existing products. We apply the “ION Playbook” to the businesses that we acquire, leveraging the ION Group’s knowhow as an experienced and lean industrial operator to deliver greater value for customers through increasing engagement, driving digitization and enabling automation. This has resulted in a re-engineering of our acquired businesses across three dimensions: (i) organizational re-engineering to remove unnecessary middle-management layers and remove duplicative and overlapping functions to attract top talent, (ii) commercial reengineering to enhance the visibility of our revenue and improve our contractual terms, including the transition to our standard multi-year contract and (iii) technological re-engineering to innovate and improve the quality of our software. Dealogic, which we acquired in 2017, is an illustrative example. Dealogic has performed strongly under our ownership. The percentage of Dealogic’s Recurring Revenue to total revenue was 94%, 95% and 93%, and 96% for the years ended December 5 ----- 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, and the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, respectively.

Acuris, which the ION Group acquired in July 2019 and which we acquired from our affiliate group, the ION Group, in February 2021 following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, is another illustrative example of how our business can drive strong performance. The Weighted Average Contract Term of Acuris’ contracts was 1.4 years, 1.6 years, 1.7 years and 1.8 years, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and twelve months ended September 30, 2021, and the Total Contract Value for Acuris increased from $334 million in 2018 to $382 million in 2019 to $424 in 2020 and $479 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2021.

As markets have globalized and become more complex, the amount of financial and operational data has grown exponentially, increasing the risk that management and execution decisions do not account for this data. With our systems holding an extensive range of market intelligence and analysis, we intend to provide our customers with data in real time and in a user-friendly format, enhanced with advanced analytics and visualization tools to enable our customers to make data-driven decisions.

The global demand for real-time data, intelligence and analysis, as well as visibility and tracking capabilities in connection with organizational workflows, capital markets issuances, M&A deals and a variety 6 ----- of other transactions has increased over time and, in times of uncertainty, will continue to increase.

We will selectively consider additional accretive acquisitions from time to time, such as our recent acquisition of Backstop, an established leader in alternative investment software, with a large and growing total addressable market, a differentiated customer footprint and a broad and high-quality product offering in front and middle office. See “—Recent Developments.” Generally, we consider targets that we believe will bridge gaps in our functional footprint, expand our addressable market segments by adding to our product portfolio and enhancing our ability to crosssell or provide innovative applications or technologies that can integrate into our existing offerings. Through our proven “ION Playbook,” which includes product, commercial and organizational re-engineering, we constantly attempt to seamlessly integrate and improve acquired businesses and products in line with our customers’ expectations, thereby adding to our value proposition.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Recent Developments,9.5.1,,"On November 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Backstop (the “Backstop **Acquisition”). The Backstop Acquisition was completed on December 28, 2021. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative and institutional investment industries. It specializes in integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment and operations firms to build and source manager relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital and service and communicate with investors. Backstop’s customers primarily include endowments, pension funds, insurance companies, family offices and sovereign wealth funds as well as hedge funds, private equity, venture capital and customers involved with real estate and infrastructure. Backstop’s revenue, EBITDA and loss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $34.0 million, $3.9 million and $(5.8) million, respectively. We estimate that our pro forma combined revenue, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies including Backstop) and pro forma combined Recurring Revenue for the twelve months ended September 31, 2021, would have been approximately $526.3 million, $378.3 million and 91%, respectively (using Backstop’s estimated results for the year ended December 31, 2021). Backstop has four core product areas: � _Portfolio Management: Backstop’s Portfolio Management product consists of a comprehensive platform to track and monitor a portfolio of investments across one or more asset classes and provides time-weighted and money-weighted performance and return statistics. � _Research Management: Backstop’s Research Management products manage research efforts and diligence processes across all asset classes, while providing integrated performance and documents feeds, consultant research and ratings and collaboration tools. � _Investor Relations: Backstop’s Investor Relations products include an integrated, web-based branded portal to provide secure access and communications between funds and their investors and a platform providing a comprehensive account management and advanced benchmarking functionality as well as performance data. 7 ----- � _Relationship Management:_ Backstop’s Relationship Management product consists of a purpose-built CRM for the institutional and alternative investment industry. The product offers a tailored entity structure and robust reporting and relationship engines which enhance deal lifecycle. We believe that the Backstop Acquisition will benefit our business by further enhancing our data and technology offering in the large and growing alternative asset space, deepening our customer relationships with asset managers and accessing new users and customers among asset allocators. Backstop is an established leader in alternative investment software, with a large and growing total addressable market, a differentiated customer footprint and a broad and high-quality product offering in front and middle office. As a result, the Backstop Acquisition will enable us to further extend into the alternative investment industry to better serve a shared client base, while allowing us to advance our product roadmap, particularly in private debt, family offices and other strategic end markets. Backstop also has an attractive and resilient business model with high recurring revenue and a sticky customer base with significant whitespace and upsell opportunity, significant standalone organic and inorganic growth opportunities, and a strong management team with deep domain expertise. The Backstop Acquisition will allow for significant revenue synergies from cross-sell, upsell and new data products, will provide a value creation opportunity and will further establish our global footprint and longstanding customer relationships within the resulting combined global customer base of over 6,000 customers. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of the New Notes to refinance indebtedness used to finance the Backstop Acquisition. See “Use of Proceeds.”",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

(10) On February 16, 2021, the Issuers, the Parent Guarantor and Holdings entered into the Existing Credit Facility Agreement pursuant to which they borrowed (including borrowings prior to such amendment and restatement) (a) dollar term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $920.0 million (subsequently increased by way of the Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement to $960.0 million) and (b) euro term loans in an initial aggregate amount of €790.0 million under certain term loan facilities (the “Existing Term Loan Facilities”). A portion of the proceeds of the Existing Dollar Notes were used to repay drawn amounts under the Existing Term Loan Facilities. As of the date hereof, $650.0 million and €784.1 million are outstanding under the Existing Term Loan Facilities. The net proceeds of the Offering will be used to partially prepay amounts outstanding under the Existing Term Loan Facilities. See “Use of Proceeds.” 10 ----- (11) Under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, certain lenders have made available a revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). As of the date hereof, the Revolving Credit Facility is not drawn. The Existing Term Loan Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Guarantors and are secured by first-priority security interests in the Collateral, subject to Permitted Liens. See “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements.”_ (12) Includes the following Subsidiary Guarantors: Acuris Inc., Acuris Risk Intelligence Limited, ARI Enhanced Limited, Blackpeak Inc, Inframation Limited, INFRAAMERICAS INC., Mergermarket Bidco Limited, Mergermarket Limited, Mergermarket Midco 1 Limited, Mergermarket Midco 2 Limited, Mergermarket USA, Inc., MERGERMARKET (U.S.) LTD, Computasoft Inc., Creditflux Limited, Dealogic (Holdings) Limited, Dealogic Limited, Dealogic, L.L.C., Diamond Bidco Limited and Diamond Midco Limited. As part of an internal reorganization and dissolution of certain entities in our corporate structure, Hoxton Holdings Limited, Acuris Risk Intelligence Holdings Limited and Identity Theft Prevention Limited were released from their guarantees of the Existing Credit Facility and the Existing Dollar Notes and their assets no longer secure obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement and the Existing Dollar Notes. (13) The entities in the Restricted Group are subject to the covenants contained in the Indentures, the Existing Dollar Notes and the Existing Credit Agreement. (14) An indirect parent company of Acuris International Limited has raised an unsecured PIK financing (with customary restrictive covenants but no covenants or other provisions that could result in a default under the Notes) for general corporate purposes. Such PIK financing matures later than the Notes. Some of the proceeds of such PIK financing were used to subscribe in the common equity of Acuris International Limited.

While we believe that we operate in attractive markets, our performance depends in large part on the financial health and strength of our customers, which in turn is dependent on the general economies of the countries in which they operate. The COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures taken to attempt to contain and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including stay-at-home, business closure and other restrictive orders, and the resulting changes in consumer behavior, have impacted and will continue to impact our workforce and operations and those of our customers and have created significant uncertainty in the markets in which we operate. It is difficult to accurately predict what further effects these conditions and measures will have on our future business and results of operations. The degree to which the pandemic impacts our future business and results of operations will depend on developments beyond our control, including the ongoing severity of the pandemic, the pace of vaccination in various countries in which we operate, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic downturn that results from the pandemic. We cannot assure you that the fallout from various governments’ attempts to contain the spread of COVID-19 worldwide will not have material consequences for the holders of indebtedness, including the Notes. This pandemic or any similar event could affect the timing of customer purchases and payments, the timing of our customer projects as well as the overall demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 may continue to have an adverse effect on global economic activity and may lead to prolonged periods of economic uncertainty, downturn, recession or depression in the countries in which we and our customers operate, which would adversely affect the demand for our products and services. The spread of COVID-19 may also cause other unpredictable or negative events which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial position. A continued global economic uncertainty and downturns in the financial services in one or more of the regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Any future epidemics may also have similar, or more severe, effects on global economic activity and on our business, results of operations or financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Adverse economic conditions and uncertainties, including any fines or penalties on financial institutions and any potential resulting failures or consolidations of financial institutions, may adversely affect us by significantly reducing our client engagements. In addition, the financial services sector is often subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny, consolidation among firms, increasing capital requirements, lower transaction volumes in certain markets and asset classes and relatively low overall anticipated market growth. These characteristics often lead to periods of reductions in costs and reduced supplier spending in the industry. While increased and more complex regulatory requirements have caused many financial institutions to increase their spending on compliance and riskrelated matters, which can benefit our business, we cannot assure you that this will continue to be the case in the future. In addition, we can provide no assurance that the ongoing adverse economic impact associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will not result in similar constrictions in client engagements.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,We operate in competitive markets and may be adversely affected by this competition.,"The markets in which we operate are competitive and are subject to rapid technological changes and evolving customer demands and needs. Some of these competitors are established companies that have substantial financial resources, recognized brands, technological expertise and market experience and these competitors sometimes have more established positions, and could have more customers, in certain segments and regions than we do. To better serve the needs of their existing customers and to attract new customers, our competitors may continue to: � enhance and improve their content, software and services (such as by adding new content and functionalities); � develop new offerings and services; � compete aggressively on price; � invest in technology; and � acquire additional businesses and partner with other businesses in key sectors that will allow them to offer a broader array of software and services. Important differentiating factors in our industry include technological capabilities, quality and breadth of content, ability to obtain and publish critical intelligence and breaking news ahead of others, user-friendliness of customer interface and ability to recruit and retain talented employees. Our competitors may also seek to differentiate themselves from the breadth of our offerings by being specialized, with a narrower focus than we have. As a result, they may be able to adopt new or emerging technologies, provide more specialized data, content and intelligence or address the requirements of certain customers more quickly than we can. New and emerging technologies can also have the impact of allowing start-up companies to enter the market more quickly than they would have been able to in the past. Some of our competitors may also decide to aggressively market their offerings as a lower cost alternative and offer price incentives to acquire new business. As some of our competitors may offer products and services that may be viewed as more cost effective than ours or which may be seen as having greater functionality or performance than ours, the relative value of some of our products and services could be diminished. Competition and cost-cutting initiatives may require us to make commercial concessions, including discounting or adjusting list prices (which may result in lower revenues), or make additional capital investments to further enhance the functionality of our products (which might result in lower profit margins). If we are unable or unwilling to reduce prices or make additional investments for some of our products in the future, we may lose customers and our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. Some of our current or future products could also be rendered obsolete as a result of competitive offerings and new technologies.

For example: � some governmental and regulatory agencies have increased the amount of information they make publicly available at no cost; � several companies and organizations have made certain financial and other information publicly available at no cost; and � “open source” software that is available for free may also provide some functionality similar to that in some of our products. Public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information and software may reduce demand for our products and services. Additionally, we source some of our information and research from third-party providers. There is a risk that these providers (or their third-party providers of data) could make data available directly to end users, thereby undercutting us. Our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by such alternative sources of data. 35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can result in losses of contracts or impact the size of our customer base. Customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. Cost-cutting, reduced spending or reduced activity by any of our customer industry sectors may decrease demand for, and usage of, some of our products. This could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations by reducing our revenues, which could in turn reduce the profitability of some of our products. Alternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on our products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer providers, including by selecting other providers with lower-cost offerings. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on our products with other providers and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to internally develop their own products, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,Delayed payments or non-payments by our customers could adversely affect us.,"Our ability to receive payment for the products and services we sell depends on the continued existence and creditworthiness of our customers. We may experience a higher than normal level of delayed payments or non-payments by our customers if their economic conditions are weakened, which could negatively impact our working capital as our trade payables may remain outstanding for a longer period of time. As of December 31, 2020, our provision for bad debts was $2.6 million on a pro forma combined basis. Should the global economy experience economic volatility or tightening credit markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk that we may not be able to collect payments on a timely basis from our customers could increase. Further, a deterioration of global economic conditions could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by our customers. Accordingly, if we underestimate the amounts needed for our bad debt provision or if our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of our outstanding receivables, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Delayed payment or non-payment by our customers, or requests for payment in advance by our suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and on our business, results of operations and financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

We are subject to rapid technological change, change in usage patterns, change in customer preferences and the emergence of new regulations and practices. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and reliability of our software and applications. We are continually seeking to improve the customer experience and our sales and marketing expertise. We continue to review and allocate more resources and increase investments in opportunities in our portfolio of software and applications that we believe have the highest potential for strategic growth. There is no assurance that we will be successful in increasing our overall revenue growth in the future. Disruptive and new technologies also create a need to adapt rapidly to the shifting landscape and we may not be in a position to adapt quickly enough or at all. We may also face unexpected challenges in mitigating the risks associated with developing new software and implementing process and technology improvements that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses and potentially resulting in our business being disrupted for a period of time, as well as additional commitments of financial resources.

Our acquisitions may not always be completed or, if completed, perform as expected. Our acquisition activities may consume a portion of our management’s focus, increase our leverage and reduce our profitability.","Our business has grown, in part, as a result of acquisitions. In September 2019, we acquired Selerity Inc. a technology provider specialized in artificial intelligence solutions for analyzing unstructured data and content. Some of these acquisitions may be transformative, such as our acquisition in February 2021, through an internal reorganization within the ION Group, of the Acuris business, one of the world’s leading providers of financial news, intelligence and analysis. Other acquisitions we may make from time to time are smaller, opportunistic expansions, such as the Backstop Acquisition. We consider acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions, including material transactions, from time to time in order to expand and enhance our product portfolio and customer base. As we seek to be disciplined, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or strategic investment candidates on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, competition for acquisitions in the market in which we operate is high, and may increase costs of acquisitions or cause us to refrain from making certain acquisitions. We may also be subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny from competition and antitrust authorities in connection with acquisitions. Future acquisitions may be large and complex, and we may not be able to complete them as planned or at all. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate the required agreements, overcome any regulatory hurdles and obtain the necessary licenses, permits and financing for such acquisitions. Management resources may also be diverted from operating our existing businesses to acquisition-related activities. Even if we are able to effectuate such transactions, the acquired businesses may not perform as expected due to various factors, including risks specific to such business, the presence of liabilities unknown to us, significant regulatory costs in foreign jurisdictions and other matters that may not have emerged during the diligence of the target of such acquisition. Any such acquisition may also increase our leverage due to existing debt at the target of such acquisition or new debt that we may incur to finance such acquisition. If such acquisitions do not perform as expected, our anticipated revenues and profits may be lower and our profit margins and cash flow may be adversely affected. Further, the intellectual property of an acquired business may also be an important component of the value that we agree to pay for such a business. Acquisitions, however, are subject to the risks that the acquired business may not own the intellectual property that we believe we are acquiring, that the intellectual property is dependent upon licenses from third parties, that the acquired business infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others or that the technology does not have the acceptance in the marketplace that we anticipated. If we are not able to successfully integrate acquired businesses’ intellectual property rights, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The integration of an acquisition may expose us to certain risks, including: � difficulty in integrating management information, accounting and financial control systems; � unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising out of the acquisition; � potential disruptions to our ongoing business caused by our senior management’s focus on the acquired companies; � difficulty in integrating any software acquired with our product portfolio; and � difficulty in establishing of an effective management and operational team for the acquired business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to efficiently and effectively integrate our acquisitions, including the Acuris Acquisition or any businesses we may acquire in the future, and any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Even if we are able to successfully integrate the operations of the business that we have acquired, or in the future may acquire, we may not be able to realize the anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements from such acquisitions, either in the anticipated amount or within the anticipated time frame, and the costs of achieving such benefits may be higher than, and the 37 ----- timing may differ from, the anticipated costs.

The assumptions we have made with respect to Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) that we present in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information. Our anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters and our anticipated ACV adjustments are based upon assumptions about our ability to retain customers. Our ability to achieve planned cost savings is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including changes in the markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realize fully, or realize in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving measures. Additionally, cost saving measures generally require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have an adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. These factors may offset the cost savings we anticipate and which we have included in our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop). Consequently, our inability to realize our anticipated cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our impact on our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA (Before Foreign Exchange Gains and Other (Gains)/Losses), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (with Combination Synergies Including Backstop) as presented herein. Moreover, our EBITDA Metrics include an adjustment for assumed earnings from ECM deal volumes, in situations where deal volumes in the ECM market for the period were below the most recent historical five-year average volumes. In line with the calculation of “Consolidated EBITDA” provided under the Indentures and our Existing Credit Facility Agreement, this adjustment smooths out the revenue impacts of periods in which transaction volume in the ECM market is lower than the most recent historical five-year average volumes and allows us to add back the portion of earnings that would have been generated in that period if deal volumes for the period had been in line with such historical five-year average volumes, but we do not make a corresponding negative adjustment where ECM deal volumes in a given period are higher than such five-year average. Such revenue adjustments assume revenue that was not realized and may not be realized in the future and are inherently subject to uncertainty.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Cyber-threats and breaches vary in technique and sources, and are caused by criminal hackers, purveyors of financial fraud, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance or error, among others. These threats are persistent and increasingly more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect. While we have dedicated resources for maintaining levels of cyber-security that we deem appropriate and we utilize third-party technology, products and services to help identify, protect and remediate our information technology systems and networks against security breaches and cyber-incidents, our measures may not be adequate or effective to prevent, identify or mitigate attacks by hackers or breaches caused by employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Furthermore, given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems, such intrusions may be difficult to detect for periods of time. Although we are not aware of any significant incidents to date, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. While we maintain what we believe is sufficient insurance coverage to cover certain aspects of third-party cyber-security claims and business interruption, our insurance coverage may not always cover all costs or losses. We are also dependent on security measures that some of our customers are taking to protect their own systems and infrastructure, if they interface with our own systems and networks. For example, if a customer experiences a data security breach that results in the misappropriation of some of the customer’s proprietary business information, our reputation could be harmed, even if we were not responsible for the breach. We collect, store, use and transmit sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees and customers on our networks. A number of our customers also entrust us with storing and securing their own confidential data and information. Any malicious or accidental breach of our data security could result in unintentional disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, third-party, customer, vendor, employee or other confidential or sensitive data or information, which could potentially result in damage to our brands and reputation, costs to us to enhance security or to respond to occurrences, lost sales, violations of privacy or other laws, penalties, fines, regulatory actions, investigations, sanctions, or litigation, and/or loss of confidence in our security measures, which would harm our ability to retain and attract customers. Also, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred, could adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.

Our customers depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our telecommunications, data centers, networks and other electronic delivery systems, including websites and the Internet. Our employees also depend on these systems for our internal use. Interruptions or delays in these operations or services could result in financial loss, potential liability, and damage to our brand and reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. Any significant failure, compromise, cyber-attack, cyber-breach or interruption of our systems, including operational services, loss of service from third parties, sabotage, break-ins, war, terrorist activities, human error, natural disaster, power or coding loss and computer viruses, could cause our systems to operate slowly or could interrupt service for periods of time. Further, these disruptions could materially and adversely impact the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we 39 ----- are located, including in cities worldwide in which we have offices. While we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans that utilize industry standards and best practices, including back-up facilities for primary data centers, a testing program and staff training, the systems are not always fully redundant and disaster recovery and business continuity plans may not always be sufficient or effective. To the extent that our telecommunications, information technology systems or other networks are managed or hosted by third parties, we would need to coordinate with these third parties to resolve any issues. In particular, because many of our products and services play a mission-critical role for our customers, any damage to, or failure of, the infrastructure we rely on (even if temporary), could disrupt our ability to deliver information to and provide services for our customers in a timely manner, which could harm our reputation and result in the loss of current and/or potential customers or reduced business from current customers.

New sales hires and reorganization of sales functions require significant management time and training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. The uncertainty surrounding the timing to fully return to a normal office environment, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, also increases the complexity of onboarding activities. As a result, our new sales hires and planned sales hires may not become as productive as we would like or as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. Experienced sales personnel are particularly sought after in our industry and we may have to expend significant resources to retain our most productive sales employees.

In addition, we have employees in many cities globally. We believe that there are advantages to operating globally, including a proportionately reduced exposure to the market developments of a single country or region. However, there are certain risks inherent in doing business globally which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. These risks include: � difficulties in developing software that are tailored to the needs of local customers; � economic slowdowns, instability and volatility in local markets and political instability of governments; � lack of local acceptance or knowledge of our software, data and content products; � lack of recognition of our brands; � unavailability of local companies for acquisition; � exposure to possibly adverse governmental or regulatory actions in countries where we operate or conduct business; � higher inflation rates in the countries in which we do business; 40 ----- � the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on prices charged to local customers, notably when there is strengthening of the U.S. dollar; � changes in laws and policies affecting trade and investment in other jurisdictions, including trade protection measures; � dispersed control of our business operations; � being subject to different laws and regulations (including those applicable in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in the European Union); � cultural and language differences; and � managing compliance with varying and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business.

Renewal dates are spread over the course of the year and across years. In order to maintain existing revenues and to generate higher revenues, we are dependent on a significant number of our customers to renew their arrangements with us. As we encourage new and existing customers to use a subscription-based license, we may become even more dependent on our existing customers. We may face pricing pressure, including at the time of renewal, in obtaining and retaining our customers due to pricing competition or other economic needs or pressures being experienced by such customers. This may result in lower revenue from a customer than we had anticipated based on our previous agreement with such customer and our revenues could be lower despite a significant number of our customers renewing their arrangements with us. This reduction in revenue could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, if our competitors are able to offer better customer service and/or are more effective than us in promoting their products, they may be able, including through dedicated promotions or other marketing activities, to cause the migration of some of our existing customers to their solutions, and we might be unable to continue to attract new customers.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Laws relating to electronic and mobile communications, privacy, data security, data protection, anti-money laundering, e-commerce, direct marketing and digital advertising have also become more prevalent and developed in recent years. As our business grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on our business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. Further, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union and actions of the U.S. federal government have created some legal uncertainties and it is difficult to predict in what form laws and regulations will be adopted, changed or repealed, how they will be construed by the relevant courts, or the extent to which any changes might adversely affect us. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, use and transmit certain types of information that are subject to an increasing number of different laws and regulations. In particular, data security and data protection laws and regulations that we are subject to often vary by jurisdiction and various U.S. state regulations. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving. For example, in May 2018, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) became fully effective and replaced the existing European Union Data Protection Directive. The GDPR introduced more restrictive provisions on personal data processing, requiring companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling, use and protection of personal data and sensitive personal data, and the ability of persons whose data is stored to access, correct or delete it. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to €20.0 million or 4% of worldwide annual revenue, whichever is greater. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. We are also subject to data localization laws in certain countries, which require us to store and process certain types of data within a particular country.

We receive revenues and incur expenses in many currencies and are thereby exposed to the impact of fluctuations in various currency rates. Foreign currency movements have been volatile over the last three years and such volatility may continue in the future. 44 ----- Exchange rate movements in our currency exposures may cause fluctuations in our consolidated financial results. If our operations outside of the United States expand, we expect these fluctuations to increase. In particular, we have exposure to the euro and British pound sterling. Some of our debt service requirements are denominated in euro and, following the issuance of the New Notes, will continue to be, and with respect to the Euro Notes, will be denominated in euro even though the majority of our cash flow from operations is generated in U.S. dollars. Significant changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and our ability to meet interest and principal payments on euro-denominated debt. We monitor the financial stability of the foreign countries in which we operate. Global markets continue to experience uncertainty, and external events have caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States or other key markets remain uncertain or deteriorate further, global credit markets may further weaken. Events that affect the global currency markets could in turn adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Changes in tax laws and regulations, international treaties and tax accounting standards and/or uncertainty over their application and interpretation as well as changes in the geographical mix of our profits may adversely affect our results (notably our income tax expense) and our effective tax rate. Additionally, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income-based taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value added, property, withholding and franchise taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) and other taxing authorities with respect to such income and non-income-based taxes inside and outside of the U.S. If the IRS or another taxing authority disagrees with our tax positions, we could face additional tax liabilities, including interest and penalties. Payment of such additional amounts upon final settlement or adjudication of any disputes could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. We are directly and indirectly affected by new tax legislation and regulation and the interpretation of tax laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in legislation, regulation or interpretation of existing laws and regulations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could impact our taxes and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. For example, on March 27, 2020, then President Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial position or results of operations. Additionally, longstanding international norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border activities are evolving. For example, the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project (“BEPS”) currently being undertaken by the G20 and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reflects concern about what is considered to be the inappropriate shifting of profits from high tax jurisdictions to low tax jurisdictions; this could impact on the geographical mix of our profits going forward. Partly in response to the BEPS initiative, the European Union Commission early in 2016 issued a seven-part Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (“ATAP”). Part of the ATAP includes an Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (“ATAD”), which received political agreement from the Member States in June 2016. Further, as part of the ATAD member states are required to introduce, among other measures, a general anti-abuse rule. Tax changes arising from BEPS and/or the ATAD, which, in the case of the ATAD, with certain exceptions, became effective in 2019 may create further limits on deductions available for intercompany transactions; it is also possible that Member States could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest or levy withholding taxes where none were levied previously. Given the uncertainty surrounding some of the changes and their potential interdependency, it is difficult to assess the overall impact that these changes may have on our cash flow, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

For example, 45 ----- investors may take legal action against us if they rely on published information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees. We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data. Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others. If the data or other content or information that we distribute has errors or contains false or misleading information or information deemed to constitute professional advice such as legal, financial or investment advice, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer. Use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for significant amounts. Any such claim, even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us, could involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources. Such claims and lawsuits could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. Additionally, we could be subject to claims by providers of publicly available data and information we compile from websites and other sources that we have improperly obtained that data in violation of law or terms of use. We could also be subject to claims from third parties from which we license data and information that we have used or re-distributed the data or information in ways not permitted by our license rights.

We rely on intellectual property laws and private contracts to protect these rights. However, we cannot assure you that we will always be able to detect and/or prevent the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary technology or intellectual property by third parties. Moreover, we conduct business in some countries where the extent of effective legal protection for intellectual property rights is uncertain and/or less than that afforded in the United States. If we need to bring litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, this may cause us to incur significant costs and consume significant legal and managerial resources, and we may not prevail in any such efforts. Any failure by us to adequately protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, we may face allegations from time to time that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties. In some cases, we may be required to obtain licenses to avoid such infringement, and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms. If we are forced to defend against allegations of infringement, it may cause us to incur significant costs and consume significant legal and managerial resources, regardless of whether we ultimately prevail. If we do not prevail in any such defense, we may be required to pay damages and/or ongoing royalties to third parties, and/or to cease sales of our software while we redesign our software to avoid the infringement.

There is a potential risk that we could infringe the intellectual property rights of other parties. Accordingly, other parties could assert infringements of intellectual property rights, including illegitimate ones, against us. Successful claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation by another party against us, could prevent us from using or marketing certain technologies or products in certain countries or require us to pay licensing costs, make changes to our software or other intellectual property, or litigate the scope or validity of patents in order to be permitted to sell our products. In addition, we could be liable to pay fines or compensation for infringements or could be forced to purchase licenses to make use of technology from other parties. Any such outcomes, or the expenditure of time and resources to defend against such outcomes, could impair our ability to innovate, develop, distribute and sell our current and planned products and services, which could materially impact our operations. In addition, even claims of infringement, misuse or misappropriation that ultimately are unsuccessful could cause reputational harm, result in litigation costs and divert management’s time and other resources. Additionally, our intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing software or services similar to, or duplicative of, our software, and our competitors may be able to do so without infringing our intellectual property rights. If such software or services do not infringe on our intellectual property rights and such software or services achieve greater acceptance, or our competitors undertake more far-reaching and successful software development efforts or marketing campaigns or adopt more aggressive pricing policies, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations. 46 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Such broad rights are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original license terms. Two main risks are generally associated with using open-source software. First, the open-source software license usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works, with the result that proprietary software integrated with the open-source software becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (open-source software and proprietary software components) is covered by the open-source software license. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second risk is that open-source software is usually licensed “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, we would bear the risks in the event of defects with any open-source software that we utilize in our products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if we integrate open-source software into any of our software, then our use of opensource software could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the open-source software license. Moreover, it is possible to receive a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code performed on such software.

Although the relationship with our personnel throughout this process has remained generally positive, we cannot assure you that our restructuring and reorganization initiatives, as well as any future initiatives that we might decide to implement to further enhance the efficiency of our sales and marketing team or other corporate functions, will not result in the loss of valuable personnel or adversely affect the productivity of our sales force, which could lead to revenue declines. In addition, turnover within our sales force can cause disruption in sales cycles, leading to delay or loss of business.

If we fail to close sales or if a customer chooses not to complete an installation after expending significant time and resources to do so, our business, financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected.","The sales and associated deployment of many of our software or services often involve significant capital commitments by our customers and/or us. Potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available software and services and require us to expend substantial time, effort, and money educating them prior to sales. Further, as part of the sale or deployment of our software and services, customers may also require us to perform significant related services to complete a proof of concept or custom development to meet their needs. All of the aforementioned activities may require us to expend significant funds and management resources and, ultimately, the customer may determine not to close the sale or complete the implementation. During the sales evaluation period, such potential customers may delay purchases, may decide not to purchase and may scale down their requirements for reasons that we do not control and cannot predict, including: � changes in economic conditions; � changes in customer personnel; � reduced demand for enterprise software; � introduction of products by our competitors; � seasonality of a customer’s IT purchases; � lower prices offered by our competitors; � changes in the budgets and purchasing priorities of our customers; 47 ----- � need for training of customer personnel; and � changes in the information systems of our customers. As a result of these factors, our revenue may be difficult to forecast, and we could experience variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter or year to year. The extended lengths of our selling cycles in relation to our customers may result in the incurrence of significant time resources in pursuing a particular sale or customer that does not result in revenue. As a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, our customers implemented increased measures requiring the approval of their senior management or procurement for purchases and projects, which may have an adverse effect on the average length of our selling cycles in the future.

We face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future. Regardless of the merit of legal actions and claims, such matters can be expensive, time consuming, or harmful to our reputation, and in recognition of these considerations, we may engage in arrangements to settle litigation. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters and inquiries, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we review the latest information available and assess the potential outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial position, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods. Legal proceedings impose additional expenses on us and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues. Risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against us in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Failure to protect confidential data, provide adequate notice of our privacy policies or obtain required valid consent, for example, could subject us to liabilities. Existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations and various legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy and data protection. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation adopted by the European Union imposes stringent data protection requirements and significant penalties for noncompliance and the European Union’s forthcoming ePrivacy Regulation is expected to impose, with respect to electronic communications, stricter data protection and data processing requirements. In addition, various laws and regulations govern the manner in which we market our subscription products, including with respect to subscriptions, billing and auto-renewal. These laws and regulations often differ across jurisdictions and continue to evolve. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Existing and newly adopted laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) have imposed and may continue to impose obligations that may affect our business, require us to incur increased compliance costs and cause us to further adjust our advertising or marketing practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with our own posted policies, could result in claims against us by governmental entities or others, negative publicity and a loss of confidence in us by our users.

As of September 30, 2021, our total intangible assets were $3,145.7 million, representing 93.8% of our total assets as of such date $3,354.4 million. Our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually (or more frequently if specific events or changes in circumstance indicate the possibility that value has been impaired) for impairment, and our goodwill is not subject to amortization. With respect to intangible assets that are not amortized, an impairment loss may have to be recognized if the expectations on which the current carrying amount are based are not fulfilled and the recoverable amount of any cash generating unit is less than our carrying amount. When calculating value-in-use, we estimate the cash flows expected from a cash generating unit or a group of cash generating units and determine the applicable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the cash flows. The impairment test is performed using forecasted future growth rate of the revenue and the operating margin, taking into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the marketplace and specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future. We may be required to record impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in the future in the event that such forecasts are cut significantly. Such impairments may also result from, among other factors, (i) deterioration in performance, (ii) adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our business activities or affect the products and services we sell and (iii) adverse changes in the applicable discount rate, due to changes in interest rates.

Subject to certain limited exceptions, the collateral agent under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement will act with respect to such Collateral only at the direction of the “Controlling Claimholders” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement).

The liens on the Collateral securing the Notes may not 54 ----- be perfected with respect to the claims of the Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these liens. Furthermore, the Security Agent has no responsibility or obligation to perfect the liens on the Collateral. Under Luxembourg law, contracts are formed by the mere agreement (consentement) between the parties thereto, subject to specific requirements. Additional steps, however, are required to grant, perfect and enforce security interests against third parties. Security interests such as pledges, and transfer of ownership as a security, granted on financial instruments, accounts and claims are governed by the Luxembourg Act dated August 5, 2005 concerning financial collateral arrangements, as amended (the “Luxembourg Collateral Law”). Pursuant to this law, a pledge is effected, not by transfer of title, but by a transfer of possession of the pledged assets to the pledgee or to a third party acting as depository for the pledgee and the pledgee’s preference rights over the pledged assets only remain in existence as long as the pledgee or the depository remains in possession of such assets. A physical transfer of possession not being possible for intangibles such as monetary claims and accounts, the Luxembourg Collateral Law provides for a fictitious transfer of possession which is effected by mechanisms which depend on the nature of the intangibles involved. In case of registered shares, the dispossession is achieved by the entry of the security interest in the register of the relevant company. Dispossession of cash collateral or rights under contracts is achieved by the security interest thereon being notified by the debtor/co-contractor or by the acceptance thereof by the debtor of such claims or the co-contractor. Dispossession of accounts are achieved by the notification to, and acceptance by, the relevant account bank of the pledge. Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing such holder’s rights in the Collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. In addition, a debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the security provider until, but not after, the debtor receives a notification of the existence of the security interest granted by the security provider in favor of the security taker over the claims the security taker (as creditor) has against the debtor. Finally, since the ranking of pledges is determined by the date on which they became enforceable against third parties, a security interest created on a later date over the same collateral, but which come into force for third parties earlier (by way of registration in the appropriate register or by notification) has priority.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Collateral may also secure additional debt to the extent permitted by the terms of the Indentures, the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement. Your rights to the Collateral may be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by the Collateral or a reduction of the Collateral securing the Notes. The value of the Collateral that will secure the Notes and the amount to be received upon an enforcement of such Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, amongst other things, the ability to sell such Collateral in an orderly sale, the costs of realization and any requirements to pay any of the proceeds to preferential creditors such as tax authorities and employees, economic conditions where our business operations are located and the availability of buyers of such Collateral. The book value of the Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety 55 ----- of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, under Luxembourg law and English law, the enforcement of a share pledge, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest in certain jurisdictions. We cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets.

Such date may be further delayed as long as (x) the agent under the Existing Credit Facilities has commenced and is diligently pursuing the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or a material portion thereof or (y) any grantor that has granted a security interest in relation to the Collateral is a debtor or with respect to any bankruptcy or similar insolvency or liquidation proceeding. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to the Existing Credit Facilities, the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral will pass to the authorized representative of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first lien on the Collateral. If the Issuers issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the Notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the Notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Security Agent. Accordingly, the Security Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Notes on such Collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first-priority obligations). The Collateral so released will no longer secure the Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ obligations 56 ----- under the Notes and the related Notes Guarantees.

After such a filing, the value of the Collateral could materially deteriorate, and holders of the Notes would be unable to raise an objection. Also, under the Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other first-priority obligations, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of firstpriority obligations and, subject to the Intercreditor Agreement, promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent, to be distributed in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement among all the holders of first-priority obligations.

Each Notes Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Issuers and certain Guarantors will secure the payment of the Notes on a senior secured basis by granting security under the relevant Security Documents. There is no guarantee that the value of the Notes Guarantees or the Collateral will be sufficient to satisfy claims under the Notes. However, the Dollar Indenture provides and the Euro Indenture will provide for general limitation language to the effect that each Notes Guarantee and each security interest granted as well as any other obligation, liability or indemnification under a Security Document will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed/secured by the relevant Guarantor/security provider with respect to the aggregate obligations and exposure of the Guarantor/security provider without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee/ security interest voidable or otherwise ineffective under Luxembourg, English and other applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee/Security Document would be subject to certain generally available defenses. These laws and defenses referred to in the Indentures include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally.

The granting of a guarantee by a company incorporated and existing in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg must be permitted by the corporate object of the company and not prohibited by the legal form of that company. In addition, there is also a requirement according to which the granting of security by a company has to be for its “corporate benefit.” For more information on the specific limitations under the applicable law of the respective jurisdictions of incorporation of the Guarantors/security provider, see “Certain Limitations on the Validity and _Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral.”_",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Any future pledge of Collateral or issuance of a Notes Guarantee in favor of the holders of the Notes or any future issuance of a Notes Guarantee in favor of the holders of the Notes may be avoidable by the relevant pledgor (as a debtor in possession), guarantor (as a debtor in possession), by the pledgor’s or guarantor’s trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (1) the pledgor or Guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge and/or issuance of the Notes Guarantee, (2) the pledge and/or issuance of the Notes Guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge and/or Notes Guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (3) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or Guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof and/or the issuance of the Notes Guarantee (as applicable), or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

The procedural and substantive provisions of the insolvency laws of these countries may not be as favorable to creditors as the provisions of U.S. law. In the event that any one or more of the Luxembourg Issuer, such Guarantors or security providers, any future guarantors or security providers or any other of our subsidiaries experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Although it is possible that the Luxembourg Issuer or the foreign-incorporated Guarantors become debtors under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, it is also possible that in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in Luxembourg, England and Wales or in other jurisdictions where the companies have their center of main interests. Such multijurisdictional proceedings may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. For more information around the specific insolvency laws of Luxembourg and England and Wales, see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations.” Luxembourg Courts or bankruptcy administrators may not give effect to the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement. With respect to the validity and enforceability under Luxembourg law of subordination provisions the Luxembourg courts would, in order to assess the validity and enforceability of contractual subordination provisions, in principle turn to Luxembourg legal doctrine and case law that admit the validity and enforceability of a provision whereby a party agrees to subordinate its claim to that of another creditor, but may not be enforceable against third parties which are not party to the relevant agreement. The treatment of turnover provisions in intercreditor arrangements in Luxembourg law has not been tested. It is possible that a turnover provision (to which a Luxembourg entity is a party) will be characterized as a mere contractual mechanism (unless it takes the form of a Luxembourg security right effective in the insolvency of a junior creditor). Where a junior creditor has been paid in priority over a senior creditor, it is uncertain whether a senior creditor can claw back these amounts in the bankruptcy of a junior creditor.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Although we and the Guarantors will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as some assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors, managers and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, in light of recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with Luxembourg or England and Wales. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in Luxembourg or England and Wales of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in Luxembourg or England and Wales. In addition, the enforcement in Luxembourg or England and Wales of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that we would have sufficient funds to provide to the Issuers to pay the purchase price of the outstanding notes, including the Notes, or that the restrictions in our Existing Credit Facility Agreement, the Indentures, the Intercreditor Agreement or our other than existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases. A change of control may result in our other indebtedness being mandatorily prepaid and cancelled and may result in an event of default under, or acceleration of, our other indebtedness. The repurchase of the Notes pursuant to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability of the Issuers to receive cash from their subsidiaries or from the Parent Guarantor to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Notes following the occurrence of a 59 ----- change of control, may be limited by our then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from providing funds to the Issuers for the purpose of repurchasing the Notes, we may seek the consent of the lenders under such indebtedness to the purchase of the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If such consent to repay such borrowings is not obtained, the Issuers will remain prohibited from repurchasing any Notes. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such financing. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain specified asset sales which are not reinvested, the Issuers will be required to offer to purchase outstanding Notes at 100% of the principal amount (or if issued at a discount, 100% of the accreted value) thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of purchase. The source of funds for any such purchase of the Notes will be our available cash or cash generated from our operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. The Issuers may not be able to purchase the Notes upon such an asset sale offer because we may not have sufficient financial resources at the time of such asset sale to make the required purchase of Notes, or because restrictions our other indebtedness will not allow such purchase of the Notes. Accordingly, if such an asset sale were to occur, the Issuers may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase the Notes and such other indebtedness that the Issuers would be required to offer to purchase or that become immediately due and payable as a result. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Any such failure by the Issuers to offer to purchase the respective Notes would constitute a default under the Indentures, as applicable, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement and certain other indebtedness.

(iii) Severance costs associated with headcount reduction of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $1.4 million relates to Acuris; $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $0.9 million relates to Acuris; and $1.9 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, all of which relate to Dealogic. (iv) Executed Acuris and Dealogic headcount reductions occurring during the year, i.e. “headcount actioned not yet cash.” “Actioned not yet cash” are cost savings that had been fully actioned by the relevant period end but not yet been realized for the period (i.e., the amount represents the incremental cost savings that would have been realized if they had been actioned on the first day of the relevant period). (b) “Other expenses” primarily relate to rent costs for duplicative office space where the lease has been terminated or the space has been sublet and non-recurring professional fees.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1778,SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA OF THE PARENT GUARANTOR,1778.28,,1778.28.1,,"The following tables present summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor as of the dates and for the periods indicated. The summary financial information in the tables titled summary consolidated income statement data, summary consolidated statement of financial position data and summary consolidated statement of cash flows data below have been extracted without material adjustment from the Historical Financial Statements of the Parent Guarantor. For a detailed discussion of the presentation of financial data, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” The summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 has been derived from the FY 2019 Financial Statements and for the years ended December 31, 2019 (as restated) and December 31, 2020 has been derived from the FY 2020 Financial Statements, respectively. The summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 has been derived from the Unaudited Interim Financial Statements. On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from January 1, 2020 as both companies were under common control at that date, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other Reserves.” As a result of this accounting treatment, the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and the comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020) are not comparable with the results of operations and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition prior to the reorganization. For the avoidance of doubt, the summary consolidated financial information of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as at and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 (as restated) and as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been extracted from the statutory financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, authorized prior to the reorganization. The Historical Financial Statements of the Parent Guarantor contained herein were prepared in accordance with IFRS. Presentation of financial information in accordance with IFRS requires our management to make various estimates and assumptions which may impact the values shown in the Historical Financial Statements of the Parent Guarantor and the respective notes thereto. The actual values may differ from such assumptions. The summary financial data and other data should be read in conjunction with “Presentation of Financial and Other Information,” “Selected Historical Financial Data of the Parent Guarantor,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the Historical Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Pay-outs under these management incentive plans are contingent on the achievement of certain EBITDA targets and are therefore not certain to be paid. We have made pay-outs under these plans in each fiscal year since each plan was in effect; we believe that it is likely, based on our current performance, that partial or full amounts under each plan will be paid during each fiscal year until termination of the plans and we currently do not have a new management incentive plan set up to replace the current one upon its termination. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the cost amounted to $18.3 million, of which $6.3 million was incurred by Dealogic and $12.0 million was incurred by Acuris. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the cost amounted to $19.0 million, of which $7.5 million was incurred by Dealogic and $11.5 million was incurred by Acuris.

(iii) Severance costs associated with headcount reduction, of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $1.4 million relates to Acuris; $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $0.9 million relates to Acuris; and $1.3 million for the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, of which $0.4 million relates to Dealogic and $0.9 million relates to Acuris. (iv) Executed Acuris and Dealogic headcount reductions occurring during the year, i.e. “headcount actioned not yet cash.” “Actioned not yet cash” are cost savings that had been fully actioned by the relevant period end but not yet been realized for the period (i.e., the amount represents the incremental cost savings that would have been realized if they had been actioned on the first day of the relevant period).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been derived from (i) the FY 2020 Financial Statements and (ii) the Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements, and certain pro forma adjustments have been made thereto, inter alia, to eliminate transactions which were historically made between entities, which are fellow subsidiaries of the Parent Guarantor as a result of the Acuris Acquisition, and would therefore have been subject to intercompany elimination. On February 16, 2021, as part of a group reorganization, the Parent Guarantor acquired 100% of the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc. from Acuris International Limited, through a series of share-for-share exchanges. This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from the first date that the companies came under common control, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other Reserves.” Therefore, these results of operations and financial position are not comparable with the results of operations and financial position of the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s and its subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial position prior to the acquisition of the Acuris business. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended to project our results of operations or financial position for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under the U.S. Securities Act. Neither the pro forma adjustments nor the resulting as adjusted financial information has been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Acuris Transaction been consummated on the date or for the period indicated and do not purport to indicate results of operations as of any future date or for any future period. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. Because of its nature, the Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information addresses a hypothetical situation and, therefore, does not represent our actual financial position or results of operation. The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information and the accompanying footnotes should be read in conjunction with the Historical Financial Statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. 72 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

(5) The adjustment relates to the elimination of intercompany sales and purchases between Dealogic and Acuris, related to costs and services charged by Dealogic to Acuris in the amount of $29.731 million. (6) The adjustment relates to the elimination of intercompany operating expenses between Acuris and Dealogic related to costs and services charged by Dealogic to Acuris in the amount of $29.731 million.

Our customers are spread globally and include a wide range of the world’s largest financial institutions, premier investment banks, law firms, private equity, credit and infrastructure funds and other investors, brokers and financial advisers and corporates. We have relatively low customer concentration, with our top 10 customers and top 11-30 customers having contributed 26% and 12% of our revenue, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020 on a pro forma combined basis. This diversity of 74 ----- customers, who are distributed across the U.S., EMEA and APAC, reduces our dependence on any industry, region or customersize specific trends. The profile of our revenue by segment, industry, geography and customer concentration on a pro forma combined basis for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]: Most recent available data is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. The profile of our number of customers across different industries of Dealogic, Acuris and the combined group as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows[*]: Most recent available data is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from long-term subscription-based licenses, which provide us with a highly visible revenue stream. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, Recurring Revenue accounted for 91% (after giving pro forma effect to the Backstop Acquisition) of our overall revenue on a pro forma combined basis. As of September 30, 2021, the Weighted Average Contract Term of our contracts was 2.26 years and we had a customer retention rate of 95%. Our business has grown organically and through acquisitions. In July 2019, our affiliate group, the ION Group, acquired Acuris, and in February 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, Acuris became part of our Group. Acuris is a leading provider of proprietary, actionable intelligence and analytics to the world’s leading advisors, investors and issuers, with its embedded products in subscriber workflows. By bringing together Dealogic’s industry-leading data and software with Acuris’ wellknown content and editorial brands and capabilities, the acquisition enabled us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of innovative, differentiated intelligence and solutions to our customers. While we have retained the original brands of the acquired companies in order to fulfill our multi-brand strategy and be able to serve a broad set of potential customers, each acquired business has been fully integrated from a sales, operational and technology perspective. In October 2019, we acquired Selerity, a financial technology company using proprietary AI to deliver content and data solutions designed to automate inefficient workflows in finance for clients ranging from sophisticated asset management firms and banks on Wall Street to innovative media and technology companies serving retail investors. Selerity’s cutting edge technology combined with the ION Group’s well-established product capabilities enable us to deliver Dealogic and Acuris world-class content to our customers across the integrated ION Analytics platform. In November 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire Backstop. The Backstop Acquisition was completed on December 28, 2021. Backstop is the leading cloud productivity suite for the alternative and institutional investment industries. It specializes in integrating datasets and insights into workflows which enables investment and operations firms to build and source manager relationships, research investment ideas, monitor their portfolio, raise capital and service and communicate with investors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Businesses are increasingly seeking to take advantage of technology that enables them to obtain certain market information, digitize and automate certain business processes. Information provides decision-makers with powerful insights. Digitization creates a number of benefits, such as increased efficiency, transparency, control, auditability, reliability and security. The automation of manual processes frees up customer resources, reduces errors and enables companies to have information in real time. Information, digitization and automation of business processes empower users to achieve more. Customers use our software for mission critical tasks, such as deal execution, roadshows and events in the context of capital markets transactions, as well as to manage complex risk management and compliance solutions. In addition, customers use our research tools to obtain insights across multiple asset classes.

As Recurring Revenue allows us to expect future revenues, it is our business strategy to sell long-term subscription licenses that generate Recurring Revenue and transition any short-term subscription licenses to long-term subscription licenses that generate Recurring Revenue. This increases Total Contract Value and in turn increases the certainty of our future Recurring Revenue. As of September 30, 2021, our Total Contract Value was $954.0 million. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2021, we generated 89.8% of our total revenue on a pro forma combined basis from sources that we consider to be recurring. Along with Total Contract Value and Recurring Revenue, we believe that customer loyalty significantly contributes to the recurring nature of our revenues, adding to predictability of our revenue. As of September 30, 2021, our customer retention rate would have been 95%. We believe that the characteristics of our software, along with our focus on long-term contracts and our customers’ needs, have resulted in these high customer retention rates and we strive to maintain and improve such rates through the efforts described under “Summary—Our Growth Strategy.”",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

On February 16, 2021, following an internal reorganization within the ION Group, the Parent Guarantor acquired Acuris Bidco Limited and its subsidiaries (constituting the Acuris business). The Parent Guarantor’s consolidated results of operations for the financial years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020 do not include any results of the Acuris business. For an illustration of what our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 would have been had the Acuris Acquisition been consummated on January 1, 2020, please refer to “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements_ reflect the results of the Group, including Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc., from the first date that the companies came under common control, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. As a result of this accounting treatment, the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and the comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020) are not comparable with the results of operations and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial position prior to the reorganization.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Factors Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations,17.3.2,Impact of IFRS 16,"In January 2016, the IASB issued IFRS 16 (Leases), which requires most leases to be recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on balance sheets for lessees, thereby eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 (Leases) and related interpretations. Under IFRS 16, a contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. For such contracts, IFRS 16 requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated and the liability accrues interest. This results in a front-loaded pattern of expense for most leases, even when the lessee pays constant annual rentals. The Parent Guarantor implemented IFRS 16 with effect from January 1, 2019 and applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach. On transition to IFRS 16, the Parent Guarantor and its subsidiaries recognized $12.6 million of right-of-use assets and $16.9 million lease liabilities. See note 1(s) to the FY 2019 Financial Statements. The FY 2018 Financial Statements have not been restated to take into account IFRS 16 Acuris International Limited implemented IFRS 16 from its incorporation and the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the Acuris 2019 Financial Statements and Acuris FY 2020 Financial Statements reflect the requirements of IFRS 16.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

We classify our revenue principally into the following four categories: (i) revenue from license at a point in time, which relates to perpetual licenses, (ii) revenue from licenses over time, which relates to subscription licenses, (iii) revenue from professional services, which relates to projects to implement, configure and upgrade software, train and consult customers, or migrate customers from one product to another or onto cloud, and (iv) revenue from post-contractual support, which relates to software support and maintenance. We typically invoice customers annually in advance for all contract revenue streams except for professional service revenue, which can be either billed in advance, on satisfaction of milestones or monthly in arrear.

This reorganization is a transaction among entities under common control. The Unaudited Interim Financial Statements reflect the results of operation of the Group, including the transferred companies, from January 1, 2020 as both companies were under common control at that date, and not from the date that the Parent Guarantor beneficially owned the shares. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the entities transferred are recognized at the book values of the transferred companies and any difference (merger adjustment) between the book value of the investment in each subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the acquired entities’ shares, together with any share premium account of each subsidiary, is classified as “Other Reserves.” As a result of this accounting treatment, the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial condition as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 (and the comparative information for the nine months ended September 30, 2020) are not comparable with the results of operations and financial condition of the Parent Guarantor as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020, which only show the Parent Guarantor’s results of operations and financial position prior to the reorganization.

This was primarily attributable to a $19.9 million increase in subscription revenue mainly driven by organic growth in subscription contracts. Non-subscription revenue also increased by $6.4 million due to the quick recovery of market activity, which was affected by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020. _Operating expenses_ Operating expenses decreased by $121.5 million, or 47.8%, to $132.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $254.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to $111.7 million foreign exchange gain in 2021 relating to the non-cash effect of our euro-denominated loans which are revalued at the end of each quarter or financial year. _Amortization of intangible assets_ Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable slightly increasing to $123.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $119.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. _Operating profit_ Operating profit increased by $143.9 million, or 393.2%%, to a profit of $107.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from a loss of $36.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, due to the reasons set forth above. _Finance income_ Finance income increased by $2.0 million to $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $35,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, due to $2.0 million increase in intercompany interest income in 2021. _Finance expenses_ Finance expenses increased by $60.8 million, or 58.9%, to $164.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $103.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

This change is primarily attributable to the decrease in our loss on ordinary activities before tax and to the deferred tax impact of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities in the United Kingdom to reflect tax rate changes enacted during the year. _Loss for the period_ Loss for the period decreased by $7.5 million or 7.1% to $98.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 from $105.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 due to the reasons set forth above.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Transaction revenue decreased by $1.3 million, primarily due to the short-term decrease in market activity due to COVID-19, with quick recovery in the second quarter of 2020 onward. _Operating expenses_ Operating expenses increased by $35.8 million, or 39.9%, to $125.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $89.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Excluding non-cash foreign exchange losses, operating expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.6%. _Amortization of intangible assets_ Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable slightly decreasing to $64.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. _Operating profit_ Operating profit decreased by $7.7 million, or 26.8%, to $21.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $28.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to the reasons set forth above. _Finance income_ Finance income increased by $0.02 million, or 200.0%, to $0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, due to higher interest income in 2020. _Finance expenses_ Finance expenses decreased by $10.3 million, or 29.2%, to $25.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the interest on our debt facilities. _Tax on loss_ We reported a tax on loss on ordinary activities of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to a tax credit of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change is primarily attributable to the decrease in our loss on ordinary activities before tax and to an additional tax burden in the United States, in particular BEAT taxes. _Loss for the financial year_ Loss for the financial year increased by $0.8 million or 21.1% to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the reasons set forth above.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in headcount from an average of 698 during the year ended December 31, 2018 to an average of 454 during the year ended December 31, 2019, as well as decreases in other expenses such as professional fees, office and related expenses and travel and entertainment expenses. _Amortization of intangible assets_ 80 ----- Amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable slightly decreasing to $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. _Operating profit_ For the year ended December 31, 2019 we recorded an operating profit of $28.7 million up from a loss of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the reasons set forth above. _Finance income_ Finance income decreased by $11.0 million, or 100%, to $0.01 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to a foreign exchange gain of $0.01 million in 2019 relating to the non-cash effect of our euro-denominated loans which are revalued at the end of each quarter or financial year, compared to a similar gain of $11.0 million in 2018. _Finance expenses_ Finance expenses decreased by $9.6 million, or 21.4%, to $35.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $44.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operating activities, bank credit lines and other forms of indebtedness, including the Revolving Credit Facility provided under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility permits us to draw up to a principal amount of $20.0 million, and as of the date hereof, the Revolving Credit Facility is not drawn. Although we believe that our expected operating cash flows, together with cash on hand, will be adequate to meet our anticipated liquidity and debt service needs, we cannot be certain that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the New Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The ability of our businesses to generate cash from their operations depends on future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors discussed under “Risk Factors” and “—Factors _Affecting Comparability of our Results of Operations.”_ We typically invoice our customers annually in advance for all contract revenue streams except for professional service revenue, which can be either be billed in advance or on satisfaction of milestones. As a result, we usually maintain a structurally negative working capital and depend on such advance payments by our customers, which are accounted for as deferred revenue, to meet our short-term expenses. Typically, our working capital is at the highest late in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter as we typically invoice at the end of the year and typically it is lowest in the third quarter. This general seasonality is affected by our invoicing for professional services, which do not necessarily occur at the end of the year.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Data and analytics continue to develop beyond traditional equities into other asset classes such as fixed income and private capital, as customers look for more diversification and flexibility in their multi-asset class investment solutions. In particular, the shift from single asset human trading to single asset and multi asset class electronic trading facilitates the need for more sophisticated distribution capabilities and data. The increased accessibility of private capital is creating alternative market structures and more sophisticated investment vehicles, which are becoming increasingly popular with investors. Alternative Asset Managers are increasingly focused on front-office Limited Partner fundraising efforts, and IR workflow management processes. Furthermore, banks are increasingly in need of real-time data, as the modes of consuming information have evolved and expanded.

New regulatory requirements such as, in the European Union, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) as part of Basel III, the revised Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II), higher capital requirements and changing standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standard 9 (Financial Instruments), require increasing transparency across systems and divisions, better integrated risk analysis and systems, real-time and more granular levels of reporting and the ability to handle large volumes of data across multiple systems. At the same time, the more onerous requirements of recent regulatory changes have driven a significant rise in spending by companies in order to implement new regulatory initiatives. Even the private markets are seeing increasing pressure to efficiently monitor and track activity that drives investment decisions, as Limited Partners are demanding more timely reporting and greater transparency. This rise, together with broader industry pressures, have led to an increased focus on minimizing control and data inconsistencies, increasing transparency and minimizing costs, where companies are increasingly looking to third-party vendors to provide more efficient and cost-effective information technology solutions. We believe that the regulatory and reporting environment will continue to evolve, and that this trend, together with associated cost pressures, will support further industry growth in our markets in the coming years, as well as drive incremental demand for, and adoption of, our software and products.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchase all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Additionally, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if the Issuers have previously issued a notice of a full redemption pursuant to the provisions set forth under the heading “—Optional Redemption.” A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control. The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuers or portions thereof validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including asset sales, equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuers’ capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of _Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only_ with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture does not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Existing Credit Facility Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers may also contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. If the Issuers experience a Change of Control that triggers a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the 131 ----- Existing Credit Facility Agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement being declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such senior Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on the Issuers. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation on the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Euro Notes. The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuers’ then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds _necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require such Issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the _funds necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_ The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived or modified at any time (including after a Change of Control) with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Issue Date, each holder will have the right to require the Issuers to purchase all or any part of such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date), except to the extent the Issuers have previously elected to redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption.”_ Prior to or within 60 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent that the Issuers have exercised their right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuers shall deliver a notice (a “Change of Control Offer”) to each holder with a copy to the Trustee and the Paying Agent, or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, stating: (1) that a Change of Control has occurred or, if the Change of Control Offer is being made in advance of a Change of Control, that a Change of Control is expected to occur, and that such holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Issuers to purchase such holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date); 224 ----- (2) the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, such Change of Control; (3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than ten days nor later than 60 days (unless delivered in advance of the occurrence of such Change of Control) from the date such notice is delivered) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”); (4) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (5) that unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (7) that holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuers to purchase such Notes; _provided_ that the paying agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the holder of the Notes, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (8) that if a holder (other than a holder of a global note) is tendering for purchase less than all of its Notes, the Issuers will issue new Notes and such new Notes will be equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered and the unpurchased portion of the Notes must be equal to €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by Euroclear or Clearstream); (9) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control; and (10) the other instructions determined by the Issuers, consistent with this covenant, that a holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased. While the Notes are in global form and the Issuers make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a holder of the Notes may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes to be made through the facilities of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in accordance with the rules and regulations thereof. The Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuers and purchase all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Additionally, the Issuers will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if the Issuers have previously issued a notice of a full redemption pursuant to the provisions set forth under the heading “—Optional Redemption.” A Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon such Change of Control. The Issuers will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their obligations under this paragraph by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers will, to the extent permitted by law, (1) accept for payment all Notes issued by the Issuers or portions thereof validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; 225 ----- (2) deposit with the applicable paying agent an amount equal to the aggregate Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so tendered; and (3) deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee or the applicable registrar for cancellation the Notes so accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that such Notes or portions thereof have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuers. The Issuers have no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Issuers could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuers could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including asset sales, equity sales, acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuers’ capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of _Disqualified Stock and Preferred Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only_ with the consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Existing Credit Facility Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes as a result of a Change of Control. In the event a Change of Control occurs at a time when the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers could seek the consent of their lenders or investors to permit the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings or securities that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings or securities, the Issuers will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes after any applicable notice and lapse of time would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. Future Indebtedness of the Issuers may also contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. If the Issuers experience a Change of Control that triggers a default under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, we could seek a waiver of such default or seek to refinance the Existing Credit Facility Agreement. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement being declared due and payable. Moreover, the exercise by the holders of their right to require the Issuers to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such senior Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such purchase on the Issuers. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control would also trigger an obligation on the Issuers to make an offer to repurchase the Dollar Notes. The Issuers’ ability to pay cash to the holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Issuers’ then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required purchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and our Structure—We may not have the ability to raise the funds _necessary to finance a change of control offer or asset sale offer required as required by the Indenture.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease or transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require such Issuer to purchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease or transfer of less than all of the assets of the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt or is entitled to be Incurred or issued as Ratio Debt, the Issuers shall, in their sole discretion, at the time of Incurrence or issuance, divide, classify or reclassify, or at any later time divide, classify or reclassify, such item of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that any Indebtedness deemed incurred pursuant to the second paragraph of this covenant shall automatically cease to be deemed incurred or outstanding for purposes of this covenant but shall be deemed incurred for the purposes of the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which such Indebtedness could have been under the first paragraph of this covenant without reliance on the second paragraph of this covenant; provided further that all Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility Agreement outstanding on the Existing Notes Issue Date shall be deemed to have been Incurred, in the case of the Dollar-denominated term loans, pursuant to clause (a)(i) of the definition of “Permitted Debt,” in the case of the Euro-denominated term loans borrowed on or prior to the Existing Notes Issue Date, pursuant to clause (a)(ii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt,” and, in the case of the revolving portion of the Existing Credit Facility Agreement, pursuant to clause (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and the Issuers shall not be permitted to reclassify all or any portion of the Indebtedness Incurred on or prior to the Existing Notes Issue Date pursuant to clause (a)(i), (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” Accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock in the form of additional shares of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock of the same class, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies or increases in the value of property securing Indebtedness will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness that are otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included in the determination of such amount of Indebtedness; provided that the Incurrence of the Indebtedness represented by such guarantee or letter of credit, as the case may be, was in compliance with this covenant.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary unless the Issuers elect otherwise, if, on any date, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions (A) Incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock as permitted by a ratio-based basket and (B) Incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock under a non-ratio-based basket, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such date with respect to any Incurrence under the applicable ratio-based basket without giving effect for the Incurrence under such non-ratio-based basket made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions. 139 ----- For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollarequivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt financing to fund an acquisition, or first issued in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, being refinanced (plus any Refinancing Expenses). The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture does not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Such 540day period (as may be extended pursuant to this paragraph) shall constitute the “Proceeds Application Period.” “Applicable Percentage” means 100%; provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.75 to 1.00 but equal to or greater than 4.25 to 1.00 or (2) 0% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.25 to 1.00.

The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer at any time prior to the expiration of the application period. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall select the applicable Notes (and the Issuers or their agents shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent that any of or all the Excess Proceeds of any Asset Sales (x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated or (y) would result in adverse tax consequences, as determined by the Issuers in their sole discretion, an amount equal to the portion of such Excess Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and such amounts may be retained by the applicable selling Subsidiary; provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Excess Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, an amount equal to such amount of Excess Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any Taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuers or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. 150 ----- To the extent the Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuers need only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the Issuers’ discretion. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified as described in the first sentence of “—Amendments and Waivers.” The Existing Credit Facility Agreement prohibits or limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers or one of their Affiliates could seek the consent of their lenders or investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers or one of their Affiliates do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuers are required to purchase, selection of such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed (so long as the Paying Agent knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only Notes in denominations of the minimum denomination of $200,000 or integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof shall be purchased (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by DTC)), by lot or by such other method as the Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and, in the case of Global Notes, the procedures of the Depositary); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not result in a holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of $200,000 (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by DTC). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left outstanding. Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee and any Paying Agent). If any Note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note) purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuers default in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased. The Indenture will provide that the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not, and the Parent Guarantor and the Issuers will not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, cause or make an Asset Sale, unless: (1) the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value (as determined in good faith by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Sale) of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and (2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, at least 75% of the consideration therefor, together with all other Asset Sales since the Existing Dollar Notes Issue Date (on a cumulative basis), received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash or Cash Equivalents or Replacement Assets; _provided that the amount of:_ (a) any liabilities (as shown on the Parent Guarantor’s, such Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding such date or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Parent Guarantor’s, such Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet in the good faith determination of such Issuer) of the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes) that are extinguished in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Sale, or that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets or Equity Interests, in each case, pursuant to an agreement that releases or indemnifies the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from further liability; (b) any notes or other obligations or other securities or assets received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or 243 ----- such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash or Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days of the receipt thereof; and (c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this subclause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $100 million and (y) 40.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, calculated at the time of the receipt of such Designated Non-Cash Consideration (with the Fair Market Value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); shall each be deemed to be Cash Equivalents for the purposes of this clause (2). Within 540 days after the Parent Guarantor’s, the relevant Issuer’s or Restricted Subsidiary’s receipt of the Net Cash Proceeds of any Asset Sale, the Parent Guarantor, the relevant Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may apply an amount equal to the Applicable Percentage of such Net Cash Proceeds (the “Applicable Proceeds”) from such Asset Sale, at its option: (1) (a) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness Incurred under clause (a) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified _Stock and Preferred Stock”; (b) unless included in sub-clause (a), to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (i) any series of_ Notes and/or (ii) any Indebtedness (other than the Notes or Subordinated Indebtedness) that is secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Notes in the case of clause (1)(b)(ii), at a price of no more than 100% of such applicable Indebtedness, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption; or (c) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets which do not constitute Collateral (in each case other than Subordinated Indebtedness of an Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Parent Guarantor, an Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); (2) purchase any series of Notes pursuant to an offer to all holders of such series of Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) or redeem any series of Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Indenture or by making an Asset Sale Offer to all holders of the Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below); _provided, however, that to the extent the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary have elected to_ purchase any amount of the Notes at a price not less than par, to the extent holders elect not to tender their Notes for such purchase, the Issuers will be deemed to have applied an amount of Net Cash Proceeds equal to such amount not tendered, and such amount shall not increase the amount of Excess Proceeds; (3) to make an investment in any one or more businesses, assets (other than working capital assets), or property or capital expenditures, in each case used or useful in a Similar Business; (4) to make an investment (including capital expenditures) in any one or more businesses, properties (other than working capital assets) or assets (other than working capital assets) that replace the businesses, properties and/or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale; or (5) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers and the Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to have complied with the provisions_ described in clause (4) or (5) of this paragraph if and to the extent that, within 540 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor, such Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable, has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment in compliance with the provision described in clauses (4) or (5) of this paragraph, and that investment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 540-day period. Such 540day period (as may be extended pursuant to this paragraph) shall constitute the “Proceeds Application Period.” “Applicable Percentage” means 100%; provided that so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result therefrom, the Applicable Percentage shall be (1) 50% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale 244 ----- and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.75 to 1.00 but equal to or greater than 4.25 to 1.00 or (2) 0% if, on a Pro Forma Basis after giving effect to such Asset Sale and the use of proceeds therefrom, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio would be less than 4.25 to 1.00. Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Cash Proceeds, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or such Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If, with respect to any Asset Sale, at the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period with respect to such Asset Sale, there remains Applicable Proceeds in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA (such amount of Applicable Proceeds that are in excess of the greater of $100.0 million and 25.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, “Excess Proceeds”), then subject to the limitations with respect to foreign Dispositions set forth below, the Issuers shall make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) no later than ten Business Days after the expiration of the Proceeds Application Period to all holders of Notes and, if required by the terms of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of such Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness, as appropriate, on a pro rata basis, that may be purchased out of such Excess Proceeds, if any, at an offer price, in the case of the Notes, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or in the event such other Indebtedness was issued with original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any (or such lesser price with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, if any, as may be provided by the terms of such other Indebtedness), to (but not including) the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and the agreement governing such Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuers may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer at any time prior to the expiration of the application period. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and any other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer made with Excess Proceeds is less than the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (any such amount, “Retained Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered or otherwise surrendered by holders thereof exceeds the amount offered in an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall select the applicable Notes (and the Issuers or their agents shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness) to be purchased in the manner described below. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, to the extent that any of or all the Excess Proceeds of any Asset Sales (x) is prohibited or delayed by applicable local law from being repatriated or (y) would result in adverse tax consequences, as determined by the Issuers in their sole discretion, an amount equal to the portion of such Excess Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant and such amounts may be retained by the applicable selling Subsidiary; provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, such repatriation of any of such affected Excess Proceeds is permitted under the applicable local law, an amount equal to such amount of Excess Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any Taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require the Issuers or any Subsidiary to repatriate cash. To the extent the Excess Proceeds exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Notes (and, if required by the terms thereof, all Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuers need only make an Asset Sale Offer up to the outstanding aggregate principal amount of Notes (and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness), and any additional Excess Proceeds shall not be subject to this covenant and shall be permitted to be used for any purpose in the Issuers’ discretion. The Issuers will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the purchase of the Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuers will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached their obligations described in the Indenture by virtue thereof. The provisions under the Indenture relative to the Issuers’ obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Sale may be waived or modified as described in the first sentence of “—Amendments and Waivers.” The Existing Credit Facility Agreement prohibits or limits, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuers become a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuers from purchasing any Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. In the event the Issuers are prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuers or one of their Affiliates could seek the consent of their lenders or 245 ----- investors to the purchase of the Notes or attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuers or one of their Affiliates do not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuers’ failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer than the Issuers are required to purchase, selection of such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are listed (so long as the Paying Agent knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered in connection with an Asset Sale Offer (with adjustments so that only Notes in denominations of the minimum denomination of €100,000 or integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof shall be purchased (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by Euroclear and Clearstream)), by lot or by such other method as the Paying Agent shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and, in the case of Global Notes, the procedures of the Despositary); provided that the selection of Notes for purchase shall not result in a holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination of €100,000 (or, in each case, such lower denomination as may be permitted by Euroclear and Clearstream). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the minimum denomination of such Note would be left outstanding. Notices of an Asset Sale Offer shall be sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, or sent electronically, at least ten days but not more than 60 days before the purchase date to each holder of Notes at such holder’s registered address or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream as applicable (with a copy to the Trustee and any Paying Agent). If any Note is to be purchased in part only, any notice of purchase that relates to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof that has been or is to be purchased. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unpurchased portion of any Note (other than a global note) purchased in part will be issued in the name of the holder thereof upon cancellation of the Note. On and after the purchase date, unless the Issuers default in payment of the purchase price, interest shall cease to accrue on Notes or portions thereof purchased.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Trustee pursuant to this section will be for informational purposes only, and the Trustee’s receipt thereof shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants under the Indenture.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clause (3) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of Notes until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series notify in writing the Issuers of the Default and such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of the first paragraph above after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer) occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series by written notice to the Issuers (and to the Trustee, if given by holders of Notes of such series) may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest, on all Notes outstanding of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes of such series, (i) waive, rescind or cancel any declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the Notes of such series (other than such nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due as a result of such acceleration)) or (ii) or waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or the Guarantees if, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such waiver, rescission or cancellation, as applicable, would not conflict with any judgment or decree. Upon any waiver of a Default or Event of Default effected pursuant to clause (i) of the previous sentence with respect to any series of Notes, such Default or Event of Default shall cease to exist with respect to such series of Notes, and any Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. 162 ----- Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes of such series, if prior to 30 days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuers deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel). Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of any series unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it in its sole discretion in respect of any loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel); (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have not given the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture and, if applicable, any Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of any series are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel) that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon any Officer of any of the Issuers becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers also are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto. An Event of Default with respect to the Notes of any series will be defined in the Indenture as: (1) a default in any payment of interest on such series of Notes when due, continued for 30 days; (2) a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any, of such series of Notes when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required purchase, upon acceleration or otherwise; (3) the failure by Holdings, the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to comply for 60 days after receipt of written notice referred to below with any of its obligations, covenants or agreements (other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) contained in such series of Notes or the Indenture; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports and Other Information,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given; (4) (x) the failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay the principal amount of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Parent Guarantor, an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or (y) the acceleration of any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness for borrowed money owing to the Parent Guarantor, an Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) by the holders thereof because of a default, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid at final maturity or accelerated exceeds $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent; (5) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of the Issuers or a Significant Subsidiary; (6) failure by the Parent Guarantor, the Issuers or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay final and non-appealable judgment or judgments aggregating in excess of $300 million or its foreign currency equivalent (net of any amounts that are covered by enforceable insurance policies issued by solvent insurance companies), which judgment or judgments are not discharged, waived or stayed for a period of 60 days after such judgment or judgments become final and, in the event 256 ----- such judgment or judgments are covered by insurance, an enforcement proceeding has been commenced by any creditor upon such judgment or judgments or decree which is not promptly stayed; or (7) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture and except through the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to any material portion of the Collateral for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Parent Guarantor or the Issuers (or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries) shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and (in each case) any such Default continues for 10 days; and (8) the Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indenture), or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary denies in writing that it has any further liability under its Guarantee or gives written notice to such effect, other than by reason of the termination or discharge of the Indenture or the release of any such Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture and such Default continues for ten days. The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a default under clause (3) of the first paragraph above will not constitute an Event of Default with respect to any series of Notes until the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series notify in writing the Issuers of the Default and such default is not cured within the time specified in clause (3) of the first paragraph above after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer) occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of outstanding Notes of such series by written notice to the Issuers (and to the Trustee, if given by holders of Notes of such series) may declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued but unpaid interest, on all Notes outstanding of such series to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium, if any, and interest will be due and payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency of any Issuer occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all the outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holders. Under certain circumstances, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of a series may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes of such series and its consequences. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of any series by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes of such series, (i) waive, rescind or cancel any declaration of an existing or past Default or Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes and its consequences under the Indenture (except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the Notes of such series (other than such nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due as a result of such acceleration)) or (ii) or waive compliance with any provision of the Indenture, the Notes of such series or the Guarantees if, in each case of clauses (i) and (ii), if such waiver, rescission or cancellation, as applicable, would not conflict with any judgment or decree. Upon any waiver of a Default or Event of Default effected pursuant to clause (i) of the previous sentence with respect to any series of Notes, such Default or Event of Default shall cease to exist with respect to such series of Notes, and any Event of Default with respect to such series of Notes arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of the Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any Event of Default specified in clause (4) of the first paragraph above, such Event of Default and all consequences thereof will be annulled, waived and rescinded, automatically and without any action by the Trustee or the holders of the Notes of such series, if prior to 30 days after such Event of Default arose, the Issuers deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee stating that (x) the Indebtedness or guarantee that is the basis for such Event of Default has been discharged or (y) the requisite amount 257 ----- of holders thereof have rescinded or waived the acceleration, notice or action (as the case may be) giving rise to such Event of Default or (z) the default that is the basis for such Event of Default has otherwise been cured. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to any series of Notes, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the holders unless such holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel). Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes of any series unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it in its sole discretion in respect of any loss, liability or expense (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel); (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes of such series have not given the Trustee a written direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions contained in the Indenture and, if applicable, any Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of a majority in principal amount of outstanding Notes of any series are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series of Notes. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to security and/or indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses (which includes the expense of the Trustee’s legal counsel) that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, a certificate regarding compliance with the Indenture. Upon any Officer of any of the Issuers becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuers also are required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after such Officer becoming aware of such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30-day time period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default and what action the Issuers are taking or propose to take with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket or any basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, in connection with the incurrence of any Indebtedness pursuant to the first or second paragraph above or the creation or incurrence or any Lien pursuant to the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Issuers may elect, at their option, to treat all or any portion of the committed amount of any Indebtedness (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) which is to be incurred (or any commitment in respect thereof) or secured by such Lien, as the case may be (any such committed amount elected until revoked as described below, the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), as being incurred as of such election date, and, if such ratio-based basket or such basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA, is satisfied with respect thereto on such election date, any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be deemed to be permitted under this covenant or the definition of “Permitted Liens,” as applicable, whether or not such ratio-based basket or basket amount calculated by reference to Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA at the actual time of any subsequent borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) is met; provided that for purposes of subsequent calculations of such ratio, the Reserved Indebtedness Amount shall be deemed to be outstanding, whether or not such amount is actually outstanding, for so long as such commitments are outstanding or until the Issuers revoke an election of a Reserved Indebtedness Amount.

For purposes of determining compliance with any Dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the Dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed or first Incurred (whichever yields the lower Dollarequivalent), in the case of revolving credit debt or debt financing to fund an acquisition, or first issued in the case of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock; provided that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable Dollar- denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such Dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, being refinanced (plus any Refinancing Expenses). The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued to refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, as the case may be, if Incurred or issued in a different currency from the Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral. 234 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of the settlement system are controlled by the settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustee, Principal Paying Agent, Registrar, Transfer Agent or any of the Initial Purchasers is responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC advised the Issuers that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities 308 ----- brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through Euroclear or Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream have no record of or relationship with persons holding through their account holders. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Directive on Administrative Cooperation requires three types of exchange of information with respect to taxation. First, a Member State must upon request communicate any foreseeably relevant information that it has in possession to another Member State, subject to specific time limits. Second, a Member State must automatically send information that it possesses about a resident of another Member State to such other state, if such information relates to (i) employment income; (ii) director’s fees; (iii) life insurance products not covered by other EU legal instruments on exchange of information; (iv) pensions; and (v) ownership of and income from immovable property.

Third, a Member State must spontaneously communicate information to another Member State in certain listed situations, e.g. if the competent authority of one Member State has a reason to suppose that there may be a loss of tax in the other Member State. The Directive on Administrative Cooperation also sets forth the following forms of administrative cooperation: (i) a Member State may have its officials present in administrative offices of another Member State; (ii) two or more Member States may conduct simultaneous controls; (iii) a Member State may have another Member State notify a taxpayer of any instruments and decisions; (iv) a Member State may request feedback from the Member State to which it provided information; and (v) all Member States must share best practices and experience in administrative cooperation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

See “Description of the Dollar Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Euro Notes—Optional Redemption,” “Description of the Dollar Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of the Euro Notes—Change of Control.” This obligation may implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to contingent payment debt instruments (“CPDIs”). According to the applicable Treasury regulations, certain contingencies will not cause a debt instrument to be treated as a CPDI if such contingencies, as of the date of issuance, are “remote or incidental” or certain other circumstances apply. The Issuers intend to take the position that the New Notes are not CPDIs. The Issuers’ position is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder discloses its contrary position in the manner required by applicable Treasury regulations. This determination, however, is not binding on the IRS and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue income on the New Notes that such U.S. Holder owns in excess of stated interest, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income rather than capital gain any income realized on the taxable disposition of such Notes before the resolution of all contingencies. If the New Notes are not CPDIs but such contingent payments were required to be made, it would affect the amount and timing of the income that a U.S. Holder recognizes.

Additional Dollar Notes are not Fungible with the Existing Dollar Notes",62.7.2,Effect of Co-Issuance and Source of Interest Payments,"The New Notes are co-issued by the U.S. Issuer and the Luxembourg Issuer and, therefore, each Issuer is liable for repayment of the New Notes in their entirety. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, if a debt obligation has both U.S. and non-U.S. coissuers, there is some uncertainty as to the determination of the source of an interest payment on such debt obligation. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the source of an interest payment on a New Note will be made by reference to the residence of the Issuer that makes the payment. Accordingly, subject to the following paragraph, we intend to treat any interest paid by the U.S. Issuer as U.S.-source income and any interest paid by the Luxembourg Issuer as foreign-source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes such treatment. There can be no assurance, however, that the IRS will not challenge this treatment, and we have not obtained, nor do we intend to obtain, a ruling from the IRS with respect to the treatment of the New Notes or the sourcing of the interest payments on the New Notes. If the interest payments on the New Notes were sourced in a different manner, the U.S. federal income tax consequences (including with respect to foreign tax credits) to a Holder would be different than those described below. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the sourcing of payments on the New Notes. A Holder of New Notes may obtain information regarding the portion of any interest paid by the U.S. Issuer and the portion of any interest paid by the Luxembourg Issuer by submitting a written request to the Issuers at the address set forth in the notices provision of each Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the clearing systems require us to designate only one Issuer for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes, and we intend to designate the U.S. Issuer as the issuer of the New Notes for this purpose. As such, an applicable withholding agent likely will treat all interest payments on the New Notes as U.S.-source income for U.S. federal withholding tax purposes. 313 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Additional Dollar Notes are not Fungible with the Existing Dollar Notes",62.7.3,U.S. Holders,"_Payments of Stated Interest and OID on the New Notes_ Payments of stated interest (which shall include, for purposes of this discussion, any taxes withheld from such payments and any payments of Additional Amounts) on a New Note will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of income recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro (in the case of the Euro Notes) will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash method U.S. Holder will not recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such interest, but may recognize exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euro so received. An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the spot rate of exchange in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the spot rate of exchange in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the day of receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder, and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder’s receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note) denominated in euros, the U.S. Holder may recognize U.S. source foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Interest paid on the New Notes generally will be considered passive category income for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes. Prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the applicability of the U.S. foreign tax credit and source of income rules to income attributable to the New Notes. The New Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In the event that the New Notes are issued with OID the amount of OID with respect to a New Note includible in income by a U.S. Holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the New Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. Holder holds such New Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a New Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the New Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the New Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a New Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a New Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under a New Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of a New Note. A U.S. Holder generally will not be required to recognize additional income upon the receipt of any cash payment on the New Notes that is attributable to previously accrued OID that has been included in its income. _Sale and Retirement of the Additional Dollar Notes_ A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale or retirement (including, for this purpose, any other taxable disposition) of an Additional Dollar Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or retirement and the adjusted tax basis of the Additional Dollar Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in an Additional Dollar Note will generally be its U.S. dollar cost, increased by any previously accrued but unpaid OID.

Long–term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. Holders is subject to preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. _Sale and Retirement of the Euro Notes_ A U.S. Holder will generally recognize gain or loss on the sale or retirement (including, for this purpose, any other taxable disposition) of a Euro Note equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or retirement and the adjusted tax basis of the Euro Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Euro Note will generally be its U.S. dollar cost. The U.S. dollar cost of a Euro Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price translated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of purchase, or the settlement date for the purchase in the case of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations, that are purchased by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects. The amount realized on a sale or retirement for an amount in euros will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount translated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of sale or retirement, or the settlement date for the sale, in the case of Euro Notes traded on an established securities market, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury regulations, sold by a cash basis U.S. Holder or an accrual basis U.S. Holder that so elects. The special election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in regard to Euro Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. Holder that does not make the special election will recognize U.S. source exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the sale date and the settlement date. Any such foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be realized only to the extent of total gain or loss realized on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition. The amount realized does not include the amount attributable to accrued but unpaid interest which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest on the New Notes.” Gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale or retirement of a Euro Note will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the Euro Note was held by the U.S. Holder for more than one year. Long–term capital gain of non-corporate U.S. Holders is subject to preferential rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. _Disposition of Euros_ Euros received as interest on a Euro Note or on the sale or retirement of a Euro Note will have an adjusted tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time the euros are received. Euros that are purchased will generally have an adjusted tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value on the date of purchase. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale or other disposition of euro (including their use to purchase Euro Notes or upon exchange for U.S. dollars) will be U.S. source ordinary income or loss.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (recast), as amended (“Recast Insolvency Regulation”), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017 the courts of the Member State in which a company’s “center of main interests” (“COMI”) (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation) is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company (subject to certain exceptions). Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company’s COMI “shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties” and that in the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office. This means that a company’s COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a company has its COMI depends on the facts and circumstances as at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. If the center of main interests of a company subject to the Recast Insolvency Regulation (a “debtor”), at the time of the request to open insolvency proceedings, is located in a Member State (other than Denmark), only the courts of that Member State have jurisdiction to open the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the Recast Insolvency Regulation and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the Recast Insolvency Regulation. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize (subject to any public policy exception) the judgment of the court commencing main insolvency proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor’s COMI is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main insolvency proceedings may, subject to certain limitations, exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (including that the powers are available provided that no other insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request for the opening of insolvency proceedings in that other Member State). If the “COMI” of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company if such company has an “establishment” in the territory of such other Member State, and such insolvency proceedings must be “secondary” or “territorial” (discussed below). Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. Territorial proceedings are, in effect, secondary proceedings which are commenced prior to the opening of main insolvency proceedings. An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.” Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State (other than Denmark) are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State (other than Denmark). Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an 317 ----- establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under the conditions laid down by that Member State’s law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. In addition, the concept of “group coordination proceedings” has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner’s recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that the Luxembourg Issuer or one or more Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Possible jurisdictions in which insolvency or similar proceedings could be opened include, but are not limited to, Luxembourg, as the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Luxembourg Issuer, and England and Wales, as the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Parent Guarantor, and the United States. Applicable laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Luxembourg Issuer, the Parent Guarantor or one or more of the other Guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.9,Luxembourg,62.9.1,,"The Luxembourg Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg and, in the event of insolvency, insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Luxembourg. The insolvency laws of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that the Luxembourg Issuer or any future guarantor incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg (a “Luxembourg Guarantor”) experienced financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (altogether referred to as insolvency proceedings) may be opened against an entity having its center of main interests in Luxembourg or an establishment within the meaning of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as applicable: � bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the company or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a Luxembourg court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open bankruptcy proceedings, ex officio (absent a request made by the company or a creditor). The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets; � controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; and � composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), which may be requested only by the company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors representing 75% of the claims outstanding) and not by its creditors directly. The court’s decision to admit a company to the composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors, except for secured creditors. In addition, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a Luxembourg court to grant a stay on payments (sursis de paiement) or to put the Issuers into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial companies, including the Luxembourg law 318 ----- on commercial companies dated August 5, 1915, as amended, (the “Companies Act 1915”). The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow the rules of Luxembourg bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of the Issuers or any Luxembourg Guarantor in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of the entity following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: � certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Inland Revenue (Administration des contributions directes); � value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Registration, Estates and VAT Department (Administration _de _l’enregistrement, des domaines et de la TVA);_ � social security contributions; and � remuneration owed to employees. Pursuant to article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, all collateral arrangements in respect of assets over which the Luxembourg security interests have been granted, as well as all enforcement events and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding any insolvency proceedings. During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by the Luxembourg court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, you should note that declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by the relevant Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “suspect period” (période suspecte) which is a maximum of six months (and ten days, depending on the transaction in question) preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date; if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency bankruptcy judgment under Luxembourg law, the court may set the maximum up to six months prior to the filing for such preceding insolvency bankruptcy proceeding. In particular: � pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; � pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; � in the case of bankruptcy, article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Civil Code (action _paulienne) give the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and_ transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit. The transactions potentially subject to avoidance also include those contemplated by the guarantee issued by the Luxembourg Issuer or the granting of security interests under the Security Documents by the Luxembourg Issuer. If they are challenged successfully, the guarantee issued and the security interests granted by the Luxembourg Issuer may become unenforceable and any amounts received must be refunded to the insolvent estate. Pursuant to article 21 (2) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, notwithstanding the suspect period as referred to in articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, where a financial collateral arrangement has been entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures, such 319 ----- arrangement is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers, liquidators and other similar organs if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. The Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that the provisions of Book III, Title XVII of the Luxembourg Civil Code, of Book 1, Title VIII and of Book III of the Luxembourg Commercial Code and national or foreign provisions governing reorganization measures, winding-up proceedings or other similar proceedings and attachments or other measures referred to in article 19(b) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law are not applicable to financial collateral arrangements (such as Luxembourg pledges over shares, accounts or receivables) and shall not constitute an obstacle to the enforcement and to the performance by the parties of their obligations. Certain preferred creditors of a Luxembourg company (including the Luxembourg tax, social security and other authorities) may have a privilege that ranks senior to the rights of the secured or unsecured creditors. Article 20 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that all Luxembourg law collateral arrangements (pledges, security assignments and repo agreements) over claims and financial instruments falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, as well as all enforcement measures and valuation and enforcement measures agreed upon by the parties in accordance with this law, are valid and enforceable even if entered into during the hardening period against third parties, commissioners, receivers, liquidators and other similar persons notwithstanding the insolvency proceedings (save in the case of fraud). Article 24 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law provides that foreign law security interests over claims or financial instruments granted by a Luxembourg company will be valid and enforceable as a matter of Luxembourg law notwithstanding any Luxembourg insolvency proceedings, if such foreign law security interests are similar to a Luxembourg security interest falling within the scope of the Luxembourg Collateral Law and even if entered into during the hardening period (save in case of fraud). In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for _intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts,_ therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may hence have a material adverse effect on the relevant Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Notes (as Issuers or Luxembourg Guarantor, as applicable). Finally, international aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or composition proceedings may be subject to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as applicable.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

As a result, unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognized in a Member State and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in a Member States than it was during and prior to the Transition Period. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant a Member State and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognized in other a Member States. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the Member States may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU or during the Transition Period.

In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Notes will be guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security interests over certain collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the security interests over the collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and the enforceability of any Guarantees granted which are governed by English law. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, its directors or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”) and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. In addition, an eligible company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely if the company were wound up (without first being in liquidation) or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realizing property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. An administrator must attempt to achieve the first objective of administration, unless they think either that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve the first objective, or that the second objective would achieve a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole. The administrator cannot pursue the third objective unless they think that it is not reasonably practicable to achieve either the first objective or the second objective and that it will not unnecessarily harm the interests of the creditors of the company as a whole to pursue the third objective. Certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. For example, upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security over the company's property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if any of the English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Collateral could not be enforced against that company, and neither the Trustee nor the holder of the Notes could institute or continue legal proceedings against the relevant English Obligor(s) in respect of the Notes or the Notes Guarantee or otherwise (although a demand could be issued in respect of the Notes and/or the Notes Guarantees), while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustee, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the board of directors of the English Obligors (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that administrators' powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge – however an administrator may only dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the leave of the court or with the consent of the secured creditor). The administrator also has the ability to challenge certain antecedent transactions. A secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act), the holder of a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver. However, while the restrictions of the moratorium are extensive they are not total. For example, contractual set-off rights may continue to be exercised, at least until the administrator makes an authorized distribution, and certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to enforce their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement (generally, this can include a charge over cash or financial instruments, such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”).** A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial collateral (including a floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons. 322 ----- Ordinary corporate administration terminates automatically after a year (albeit the administration may be extended by court order or, subject to a limit of one year, by consent of the creditors). The English Obligor(s) may exit administration if the administrator is satisfied that one or more of the statutory objectives have been achieved (upon application to and order of the court if the administration is pursuant to an administration order) and may resume normal business upon exiting administration. However, the administrator also has the power, should they conclude that there is no reasonable prospect of rescuing the company, to either place the company into liquidation or use his powers under, and in accordance with, the Insolvency Act to distribute the company’s assets and thereby achieve substantially the same result as a liquidation.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The latter are not administrative receivers and are mostly used to sell land or other specific assets subject to a fixed charge. If a company grants a “qualifying floating charge” (see “Qualifying Floating Charges”) to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver provided the qualifying floating charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act to the prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements” (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ""capital market investment"" (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company's property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. The ability to appoint a receiver over secured assets (in contrast to an administrative receiver) is typically provided for in English law security documents. There is also a (limited) statutory right under section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925 for the holder of a mortgage or charge created by deed over the assets of a chargor to appoint a receiver over the charged assets to collect the income of the charged property and apply it in satisfaction of the secured debt. A receiver can be appointed in accordance with the terms of the security documentation which typically provide for the ability to appoint a receiver once the relevant security interests become enforceable in accordance with their terms. Once appointed, the receiver acts as the agent of the chargor. The charge document pursuant to which the receiver is appointed will typically set out the powers of the receiver once appointed. Typically, these powers will include the right to take possession of and sell the charged assets, with the proceeds being used to pay the secured creditors. An administrative receiver’s and, typically, a receiver’s primary duty is to realize the secured assets and to pay the proceeds to the secured creditor, up to the amount of the secured debt (subject to the requirement to set aside the prescribed part (see “Priority _on insolvency”)). He does, however, also owe duties to the company, in particular a duty to obtain the best price reasonably_ obtainable at the relevant time when selling any asset. There is no moratorium in receivership or administrative receivership, so creditors can enforce any rights that are consistent with the priority of the security, including exercising rights of set-off and forfeiture, collecting goods that are subject to valid retention of title claims and terminating contracts. If a company is already in administration, the moratorium on creditor action will prevent the appointment of a receiver or administrative receiver unless (in the case of a receiver) the administrator consents or the court permits the appointment, or an exception to the moratorium applies (see above). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was 323 ----- appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. In contrast the appointment of a receiver who is not an administrative receiver does not prevent the appointment of an administrator. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver appointed over part of the company’s property must resign if required to do so by the administrator unless that receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement, as per Reg. 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company's members, and which is in turn divided into members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above) or the court is of the opinion that it is just and equitable for the company to be wound up. Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales, with their COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales or which have a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in a Member State (except Denmark) but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory windingup, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company's property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company and its property will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company or its property without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security. A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation. A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors' choice will prevail. A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company's property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. 324 ----- Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities, and if a contract is disclaimed the contractual counterparty has a right to sue for damages in respect of the terminated contract. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply where the collateral-provider or collateral-taker under the arrangement is being wound up, to any financial collateral arrangement.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Though it does not result in the insolvency of a company, a CVA is implemented under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner who will act as the nominee before the CVA proposals are approved, and as the supervisor afterwards. CVAs may also be used as a tool alongside a formal insolvency procedure such as administration in order to implement a compromise between the debtor company and its creditors. A company is eligible to propose a CVA if it is (i) registered under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding legislation) in England and Wales or Scotland (ii) if it is incorporated in a Member State or (iii) if the company is not incorporated in a Member State but has its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) or in the UK. The CVA can be proposed by the relevant company’s directors (if the relevant company is not in administration or liquidation) or, if the relevant company is in administration or liquidation, by the administrator or the liquidator (as applicable). The proposal for a CVA would generally include a rescheduling or reduction of the company's unsecured debts, but may also form part of more complex arrangements that seek to balance the interests of many different creditor groups. If the proposals under the CVA are approved by the requisite majority of creditors (i.e. a majority in excess of 75% in value of creditors who respond in the decision procedure) and provided that those voting against the proposal do not include more than 50% in value of creditors who are unconnected with the company whose claims are admitted for voting, a CVA will bind all unsecured creditors of a company who were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure - however a CVA will not affect the rights of secured creditors or preferential creditors unless they agree to the proposals. Shareholders of the company will also be asked to vote on the CVA but whether or not they vote in favor, the CVA will be implemented if the requisite majority of creditors approve the proposal.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company’s insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realization of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. 325 ----- The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): � First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; � Second ranking: If the company has gone into administration, or proceedings for the winding up of the company have begun, in each case within 12 weeks of the end of a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act (see “Moratorium” below): (i) debts falling due or after the moratorium by reason of an obligation incurred during it; and (ii) certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” (see “Moratorium” below); � Third ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); � Fourth ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. o Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. o Secondary preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (ii) VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally; � Fifth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realizations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; � Sixth ranking: o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realizations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; o secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which preceded such liquidation. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and � Seventh ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. 326 ----- Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provide that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act). An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g., an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realizations) (the “Prescribed Part”). Under current law, this ring-fence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the company's net property and 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the resulting benefit to creditors.

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise or arrangement with respect to a company’s creditors or members (or any class of them) where such company is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act. In practice, a company incorporated in England will satisfy this test. A company incorporated outside of England will satisfy this test if it has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction, which requirement has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s “centre of main interests” is in England, the company's finance documents are English law governed and contains a jurisdiction clause in respect of the English courts, or the company's finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law and to include a jurisdiction clause in respect of the English courts. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors (or members) will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. The compromise or arrangement can be proposed by the company or its creditors, but in practice it is almost always a company-led process. To proceed to the sanction hearing, the scheme must be approved by a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those persons present and voting at the meeting(s), in person or by proxy, of each class of creditors (or members), irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents. If approved by the requisite majorities at the scheme meeting(s), the scheme must then be considered by the court again at the sanction hearing, where the court will exercise its discretion to decide whether to sanction the scheme, which generally involves it considering all statutory and procedural requirements have been fulfilled and the overall fairness of the scheme. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme. Once sanctioned by the court, the scheme will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “Moratorium”) to provide protection pending the sanction of the scheme if the relevant company is eligible. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 where these apply. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.11,"Insolvency Regulation”), and, where a company incorporated under English law has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) in a",62.11.15,Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020,"On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA 2020”) enacted fundamental reforms to the United Kingdom’s existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the United Kingdom legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include the following: _Moratorium_ Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a ‘debtor-in-possession’ process, meaning that a company in a moratorium remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a ‘monitor’. Despite the existence of a “payment holiday” in respect of certain pre-moratorium debts which exists throughout the moratorium, the company will still be expected to pay certain debts incurred while the moratorium is in force under an obligation incurred before 328 ----- the moratorium commenced (known as “priority pre-moratorium debts”), including the costs of goods and services, employees and rent, together with all amounts falling due under loan agreements and other financial services contracts. The initial duration of the moratorium is 20 business days, beginning on the business day after the day on which the moratorium comes into force and is extendable for (i) a further 20 business days by the directors, (ii),up to a year with creditor consent (including the initial 20 business day period), and up to any date set by the court in its discretion following an application by the directors of the company. Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a number of exclusions from eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets arrangements where the debt incurred (or, when entering into the agreement, expected to be incurred) was at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, amongst other things, secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors. _Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the counterparty company being made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such procedures include winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e., other than on the counterparty being subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition. _Restructuring plan_ CIGA 2020 introduced a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006 (see “England and Wales—Scheme of arrangement”), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. The restructuring plan under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of State is given the express power to exclude regulated companies providing financial services from being able to propose a restructuring plan, and may also provide for other exclusions as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may be party to a restructuring plan. A restructuring plan is available to a company where two conditions are met. The first condition is that the company has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern. The second condition is that a compromise or arrangement is proposed between the company and its creditors or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. There is no other financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see “Moratorium”), any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” (see “Moratorium”) may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the restructuring plan without their consent. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent's application to convene a meeting of creditors or members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan. Once the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors/members to vote on the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by a statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material interests of the directors of the company and the effect on those interests of the plan insofar as it is different from the effects on the like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring plan must be permitted to participate in a class meeting ordered by the court, provided that this will not apply in relation to a class of creditors or members of the company if, up on application, the court is satisfied that none of the members of that class has a genuine economic interest in the company. At the relevant class meeting(s), the restructuring plan will be approved if a number representing at least 75% in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members (as applicable) present and voting vote in favor of it. In contrast to 329 ----- a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement that a majority in number must also vote in favor of the restructuring plan. Following the class meeting(s), a restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although there are no provisions which expressly set out how the court’s discretion is to be exercised, the court will draw on the principles applicable to schemes. For example, the court may refuse to grant sanction if it considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable. As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme or arrangement does not have, a “cross-class cram down” provision. This grants the court a discretion to sanction a restructuring plan, even if one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favor of it, thereby “cramming-down” dissenting classes, if: (i) the court is satisfied that none of the members of the dissenting class(es) would be any worse off under the restructuring plan than they would be in the event of the “relevant alternative” (i.e. whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and (ii) the restructuring plan has been approved by a number representing at least 75% in value of a class of creditors or members (as applicable), present and voting, who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative referred to in (i) above. As with schemes of arrangement, the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a restructuring plan where such company is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act, which (as with schemes) includes where a non-English company has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction. A restructuring plan sanctioned by the court will be binding on all affected parties, whether they initially voted in favor of it or not, and will be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies. Parties’ rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the restructuring plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see “Moratorium”) to provide protection pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible. The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention, or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties. _Temporary measures_ In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, legislation was introduced to restrict temporarily the ability of creditors to present winding- up petitions and of courts to grant winding- up orders. With effect from October 1, 2021, those restrictions expired and were replaced by the Schedule 10 Regulations, a set of new more limited regulations introducing temporary targeted measures to limit the use of winding- up petitions in certain circumstances but not prevent their general use. The Schedule 10 Regulations provide that a winding- up petition may not be presented by a creditor on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts unless certain conditions are met. The principal consequence of those conditions is that, between October 1, 2021 and March 31, 2022 (subject to change): � a creditor may not present a winding up petition on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts in respect of an excluded debt, being a debt in respect of any sum payable by a tenant under a business tenancy that is unpaid by reason of a financial effect of coronavirus. In addition, the debt must be for a liquidated amount that is due for payment; � a creditor may not present a winding up petition on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts in respect of a debt or (where the petition relates to two or more debts) debts totaling less than £10,000; and � a creditor may not present a winding up petition on the grounds that a company is unable to pay its debts unless the creditor has delivered written notice to the debtor stating that the creditor is seeking the debtor’s proposals for the payment of the debt and that if the debtor has not made a proposal that is to the creditor’s satisfaction within 21 days beginning with the day the notice was delivered, the creditor intends to present a winding- up petition. 330 ----- The court has the power to waive the requirement for creditors to serve a formal request seeking proposals for payment of the debt or to shorten the period within which such proposals are to be submitted. _So-called “Henry VIII” powers_ CIGA 2020 further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person's corporate duties and liabilities 331 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in England and Wales, provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an “establishment” (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). As such, should any English Obligor have its COMI in a country other than the UK, and insolvency proceedings are opened in that jurisdiction and afforded recognition by the English courts, any proceedings opened in England and Wales would be foreign non-main proceedings and would be limited to the assets that the relevant company has in the UK. Upon recognition of foreign main proceedings, an automatic stay, equivalent to the stay in an English compulsory liquidation (see “Liquidation/winding-up”), will apply to prevent certain types of creditor action in the UK, including commencement of proceedings concerning the debtor's assets, rights, obligations or liabilities (but the automatic stay will not affect a creditor's rights to enforce security interests over the Collateral (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court)). No automatic stay applies in relation to foreign non-main proceedings (albeit such a stay may be requested from the English court). Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK. While this allows 320 ----- English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings in relevant other jurisdictions.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code a fraudulent transfer can be challenged for a two-year period under federal law or under a longer period under applicable state law. In New York state, the challenge would need to be brought within four years of the relevant transfer or, in case of intentional fraudulent transfers, within the later of (i) four years of the relevant transfer or (ii) one year of when the transfer was or could reasonably have been discovered. _Preference_ Any transfer of an interest of the Obligors in property to or for the benefit of the Notes, including payments made on account of the Notes or the grant of any security interest, whether now or pursuant to security documents delivered after the date of the Indentures, might be avoidable in a U.S. bankruptcy case by the transferor (as debtor-in-possession) or by its bankruptcy trustee as a preference if certain events or circumstances exist or occur (subject to certain defenses and exceptions), including, among others, if the transferor is insolvent at the time of the transfer, a bankruptcy case in respect of the transferor is commenced within 90 days following the transfer (or in certain circumstances, a longer period) and the transfer permits the holders of the Notes to receive a greater recovery than if the bankruptcy case were a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and the transfer had not been made. _Other actions_ As a court of equity, a U.S. bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination, if the U.S. bankruptcy court determines that: (i) the holder of Notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of Notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. _The automatic stay_ The right of a holder of the Notes to enforce the Obligors’ payment obligations under the Notes and Notes Guarantees or its security interests and other rights against the Obligors upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Indentures governing the Notes is likely to be significantly impaired by applicable U.S. bankruptcy law if one or more of the Obligors becomes a debtor in a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as a holder of Notes, is prohibited by the automatic stay imposed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from, among other things, commencing or continuing any action or proceeding against the debtor or taking any action to obtain possession of or exercise control over property of the bankruptcy estate. The automatic stay in a bankruptcy case of one or more of the Obligors could therefore prevent the holders of the Notes from obtaining possession or exercising control over the Collateral or commencing any action in an attempt to obtain possession or exercise control over the Collateral or otherwise enforce their rights under the Notes. The automatic stay could be lifted or modified with bankruptcy court approval in certain circumstances, but parties may object to any creditor’s request to lift or modify the automatic stay, and the bankruptcy court may deny such a request. _Right of debtor-in-possession to remain in control of collateral and the bankruptcy process_ 332 ----- An entity that becomes a debtor under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code remains in possession of its property and is authorized to operate and manage its business as a “debtor-in-possession” subject to certain limitations. This remains the case unless a chapter 11 trustee is appointed or the chapter 11 case is converted to a chapter 7 liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, in which case a chapter 11 trustee or chapter 7 trustee remains in possession of the debtor’s property. Moreover, the U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral (and, subject to satisfaction of certain legal requirements, to grant senior liens on such collateral to secure postpetition financing) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” of its interest in the debtor’s property. Under certain circumstances, a secured creditor may need to request that a bankruptcy court order the debtor to provide adequate protection of the secured creditor’s interest. The term “adequate protection” is not defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but it may include making periodic cash payments, providing an additional or replacement lien or granting other relief, in each case to the extent that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in such collateral decreases during the pendency of the bankruptcy case as a result of (i) the use, sale or lease of such collateral, (ii) the incurrence of postpetition financing secured by senior or “priming” liens on the same collateral and/or (iii) the imposition of the automatic stay. The type of adequate protection provided to a secured creditor may vary according to circumstances. A U.S. bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor is not entitled to any additional adequate protection for a decrease in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the amount of the debt that it secures by a sufficient margin. Only the debtor in a chapter 11 bankruptcy case may propose a chapter 11 plan unless the debtor fails to file a plan within the first 120 days of the case or its plan has not been accepted within the first 180 days of the case by each class of claims or interests that is impaired under the plan. The bankruptcy court may reduce or enlarge these periods for cause upon request of a party in interest. The 120-day period could be extended for up to 18 months after a chapter 11 filing, while the 180-day period could be extended for up to 20 months after a chapter 11 filing. During these “exclusive periods,” other parties, such as secured creditors, would be precluded from proposing or soliciting acceptances of their own chapter 11 plans. In view of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” the exclusive periods, and the broad discretionary power of a U.S. bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict: � whether or when a holder of the Notes could enforce its security interests; � the value of the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at the time a chapter 11 plan is proposed or confirmed; or � whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the collateral through the requirement of “adequate protection.” _A debtor-in-possession may obtain new credit secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens_ The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits a debtor-in-possession or trustee in a chapter 11 case to obtain an extension of new credit from an existing lender or from a new lender. The bankruptcy court may, depending on the facts and circumstances, authorize the debtor-in-possession or trustee to obtain new credit or incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to existing liens, provided that, among other things, there is adequate protection of the interests of the holders of the existing liens. In other words, it is possible that in connection with a chapter 11 case of one or more of the Obligors, such Obligor or Obligors would be permitted to incur new debt that is secured by a lien that is senior or equal to the liens that exist at the time of the chapter 11 filing. _Post-petition interest_ Any future bankruptcy trustee, the debtor-in-possession or competing creditors could possibly assert that the fair market value of the collateral with respect to the Notes on the date of the bankruptcy filing was less than the then-current principal amount of the Notes. Upon a finding by a bankruptcy court that the Notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the Notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In the event of a U.S. bankruptcy case, the holders of the Notes will be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code only to the extent that the value of their security interest in the collateral is greater than their pre-bankruptcy claim. Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that the obligation under the Notes equals or exceeds the fair market value of the collateral securing the Notes. Holders of the Notes that have a security interest in the collateral with a value equal to or less than their pre- bankruptcy claim will generally not be entitled to post-petition interest under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. _Ability to confirm a chapter 11 plan notwithstanding the dissenting votes of creditors_ Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a chapter 11 plan can bind a creditor or equityholder (or class of creditors or equityholders) that does not accept the plan. A chapter 11 plan provides for the comprehensive treatment of all claims asserted against the debtor and the property of the bankruptcy estate and may provide for the readjustment or extinguishment of equity interests. Claims and interests may be classified by type. Only those classes of claims and interests impaired by the plan and receiving distributions under the plan may vote to accept or reject such plan. Classes of claims and interests that are unimpaired are not entitled to vote on the plan and are deemed to accept it. Classes of claims and interest that receive no distributions under the plan are not entitled 333 ----- to vote on the plan and are deemed to reject it. A class of claims is deemed to accept the plan if creditors holding at least twothirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the claims of such class accept the plan. A plan can be confirmed by the bankruptcy court over the dissenting votes of members of a class that accepts the plan overall. Furthermore, even if one or more impaired classes reject the plan, the plan may still be confirmed, subject to specific statutory requirements, in accordance with the “cram-down” provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which require, among other things, that one impaired class has accepted the plan and that the plan does not discriminate unfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of claims or interests that is impaired under, and has not accepted, the plan. This could allow the debtor or other plan proponent to confirm its plan over the objection of one or more dissenting classes.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1790,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL,1790.2,Luxembourg Law Limitations,1790.2.1,,"_Security interest_ According to Luxembourg conflict of law rules, the courts in Luxembourg will generally apply the lex rei sitae or lex situs (the law of the place where the assets or subject matter of the pledge or security interest is situated) in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over such assets. As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables/claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities which are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. If there are assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, the security interests over such assets will be governed by Luxembourg law and must be created, perfected and enforced in accordance with Luxembourg law. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg law of August 5, 2005 on financial collateral arrangements (the “Collateral Law”), the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A share pledge agreement must be (i) acknowledged and accepted by the company which has issued the shares (subject to the security interest) and (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional acknowledgement, acceptance and/or registration in the shareholders’ register of such company. A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment when the agreement pursuant to which the pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or if he did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, he will be validly discharged if he pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank. In addition, the account bank has to waive any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, the perfection of such pledge will require additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank. Until such registrations, notifications and acceptances occur, the pledge agreements are not effective and perfected against the debtors, the account banks and other third parties. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event: � appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) the listing price of the pledged assets; � sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction at commercially reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale at the stock exchange, or (iii) by way of a public auction; � court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or � set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses, and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers/administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests/arrangements, which are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers/administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, in particular where the Luxembourg security grantor becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the 334 ----- Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the Recast Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another Member State in which the EU Regulation applies, and in accordance of article 5 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Such creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgors through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries of the pledges will in principle remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale (subject to preferred rights by operation of law). Under Luxembourg law, certain creditors of an insolvent party have rights to preferred payments arising by operation of law, some of which may, under certain circumstances, supersede the rights to payment of secured or unsecured creditors, and most of which are undisclosed preferences (privilèges occultes). This includes in particular the rights relating to fees and costs of the insolvency official as well as any legal costs, the rights of employees to certain amounts of salary, and the rights of the Treasury and certain assimilated parties (namely social security bodies), which preferences may extend to all or part of the assets of the insolvent party. This general privilege takes in principle precedence over the privilege of a pledgee in respect of pledged assets. The Luxembourg Issuer and other entities incorporated in Luxembourg have granted or will grant security interests and guarantees in order to secure, inter alia, the obligations under the notes. The Companies Act 1915 does not provide for rules governing the ability of a Luxembourg company to guarantee the indebtedness of another entity of the same group. A company may give a guarantee provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the company’s corporate purposes, corporate benefit and is in the best interest of the company. Whether an action is in the corporate interest of a company is a matter of fact not a legal issue. The directors/managers of a company are those who are able to assess whether such company has a corporate benefit and interest in granting cross- or up-stream security interests or guarantees. Although no statutory definition of corporate benefit (intérêt social) exists under Luxembourg law, corporate benefit is widely interpreted and includes any transactions from which the company derives a direct or indirect economic or commercial benefit in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportionate to the burden of the assistance. The provision of guarantee/security interest for the obligations of direct or indirect subsidiaries is likely to raise no particular concerns, whereas the provision of crossstream and upstream guarantees/security interests may be more problematic. It cannot ultimately be excluded that granting of security interest/guarantee, which would be considered by a Luxembourg court as made in the absence of corporate interest, be declared void on the ground of illegal cause (cause illicite). Following the French supreme court case law, to which Luxembourg courts might turn, a Luxembourg entity could find a benefit and a corporate interest in granting security interests and guarantees for the obligations of other group entities if certain conditions are met. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity can include, to a certain extent, the interest of the group, and that the existence of a group interest can in certain cases result in the guarantee being held enforceable even where corporate benefit is not established. In this way, reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion to the real financial means of the assisting company (i.e., limited to an aggregate amount not exceeding the assisting company’s own funds (capitaux _propres)), the company must receive some benefit or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the_ affiliates and the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company. A person is also an associate of any person whom he employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are his associates together have control of it. 335 ----- A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies, or (ii) it is controlled by a person and that person’s associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it is controlled by a group of two or more persons who also control the other company, and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1790,CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON THE VALIDITY AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE COLLATERAL,1790.3,English Law Limitations,1790.3.2,Reviewable Transactions,"There are five principal provisions of the Insolvency Act under which transactions entered into prior to a company's insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244). These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings. _Transactions at an undervalue_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency (as described below)); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “English Law Limitations—Connected persons”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent 336 ----- liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (six months before the onset of the insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a Connected Person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. It is for the administrator or liquidator to demonstrate that the company was insolvent at the time and that the company was influenced by a desire to prefer the counterparty to the transaction, unless the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (other than solely by reason of being an employee of the company), in which case there is a presumption that the company was influenced by a desire to prefer and the connected person must demonstrate in such proceedings that there was no such desire. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company. _Voidable floating charges_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that company over its property may be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of twelve months before the onset of insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge, the value of so much of that consideration as consists of the discharge or reduction, at the same time as, or after, the creation of the charge, of any debt of the company, and of the interest on any such amount. No court action is required. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to appoint an administrator out-of-court or through the less onerous in-court route for qualifying floating charge holders or (if the holder would otherwise have been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held invalid), to appoint an administrative receiver. Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests. It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets 337 ----- out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transactions_ If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). _Orders_ In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor’s ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterization is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterized as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor's net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the security agent 338 ----- to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors' duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with “likely” in this context meaning “probable.” Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to UK company law. Under UK company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. 339 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Purchase Agreement provides that the Initial Purchasers are obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase all the New Notes, if any are purchased. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the New Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased up to a specified amount or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated. The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery of the New Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the New Notes may from time to time be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. Depending on market conditions, certain of the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own accounts.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the New Notes described in this Offering Memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such New Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. The target market and distribution channel(s) may vary in relation 340 ----- to sales outside the EEA in light of local regulatory regimes in force in the relevant jurisdiction. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such New Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States and the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the New Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other material relating to us or the New Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the New Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the New Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction.

Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the New Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of the New Notes. See “Transfer Restrictions.” The Issuers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbor of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the New Notes. The New Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no market. We will apply for the New Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the New Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be obtained, or if obtained, will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market for the New Notes as permitted by applicable law after completing the offering of the New Notes.

Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the New Notes more than two business days prior to the settlement date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum will be required, by virtue of the fact that the New Notes initially will settle in T+, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent failed settlement. Such purchasers should consult their own advisors. In connection with the offering of the New Notes, the Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the New Notes. Specifically, the Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open market to stabilize the price of the New Notes. The Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot the offering of the New Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase New Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilization Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase New Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the New Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilization Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurance can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the New Notes.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES _(a)_ _General information_ The consolidated financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 11 April 2021. I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited is a private company limited by shares which was incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, 2[nd ] Floor, London, EC4R 1BE, United Kingdom The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Strategic Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23. _(b)_ _Basis of preparation_ The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: - Statement of Cash Flows; - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries; - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements; - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures; - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs. The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements. The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the ‘period of assessment’). The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, business performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multi-year contracts with customers with the services provided being critical to our customer’s operations and these services can be performed remotely by the Group. The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a severe but plausible downside case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities (see note 15 for the details on the loans and note 25 for details on the post year end refinancing). As a result of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group and the Company is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months. _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_ The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2020. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common F 35 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1368,EQUITY AND LIABILITIES,1368.12,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2020 (Continued),1368.12.1,,"1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation (continued)_ control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired. Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of the Company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2020. Financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation. The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principles of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves. _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_ The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements and estimates have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements: (i) _Development costs:_ The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the expected period of benefits. (ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals. (iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. (iv) _Provision for doubtful debts: The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail. F 36 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)_ (v) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Please see note 24 for further details. (vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial measurement of the lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, the group makes judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease. _(e)_ _Intangible assets_ Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the recognition criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The useful economic lives of intangible assets with finite lives are as follow: Databases ..................................................... 10 years Technology . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years Customer relationships . . . . . . . . . . . 11-25 years Trade names . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10-20 years Development costs ....................................... 3 years Other intangibles . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1-8 years Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. F 37 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(f)_ _Research and development costs_ Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied: - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; - there is an ability to use or sell the software product; - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit. The current weighted average life of capitalised development costs is 3 years (2019: 3 years). _(g)_ _Goodwill_ Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. _(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. F 38 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_ Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Leasehold improvements ............................................. over the period of lease Computer equipment .................................................... 3 years Fixtures and fittings ....................................................... 3 years Right-of-use assets ....................................................... over the period of lease The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition. _(j)_ _Investment in subsidiaries_ Investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at cost, being either the value of the capital injected into a subsidiary through subscription of shares or by way of a capital contribution, or the amount of consideration paid to another group entity under common control for the equity shares issued by the subsidiary. Subsequent to initial measurement, the investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less impairment. _(k)_ _Leases Leases as a lessee_ The Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month or less and leases of low-value assets. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are not included in the lease liability and an estimate of the restoration costs required under the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received. Depreciation on the right-of-use asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset, the Group follows the policy for property, plant and equipment, being cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments and corresponding adjustment of such remeasurement is made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-of-use asset is reduced to zero. The Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease commitment. The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value items in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. Low-value items comprise IT equipment. _Leases as a lessor_ When the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as a finance lease when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted for as an operating lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss. F 39 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(k)_ _Leases (continued)_ When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. _(l)_ _Pension costs_ The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. _(m)_ _Provisions for liabilities_ A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. _(n)_ _Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial_ recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Subsequent measurement_ — for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets held by the Group are classified in the following categories: - Financial assets at amortised cost — the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (ii) based on the contractual terms, the expected cashflows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as separate derivatives, other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Impairment of financial assets — the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all_ debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic environment. F 40 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(n)_ _Financial assets (continued)_ The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Group’s intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities. _Derecognition — a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar_ financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when: - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. _(o)_ _Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at_ initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement_ — the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: - Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. - Loans and borrowings — after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Derecognition of financial liabilities — a liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to_ it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(p)_ _Fair value measurement of financial instruments_ When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Statement of Financial Position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and the selection of appropriate discount curves, and other market inputs. F 41 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(q)_ _Classification of financial instruments_ An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair value basis. _(r)_ _Foreign currency translation_ Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. _(s)_ _Taxation_ The tax expense for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity, otherwise, income tax is recognised in profit or loss. Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted for the financial year. Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Company to make a single net payment. _(t)_ _Revenue recognition_ The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. F 42 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(t)_ _Revenue recognition (continued) Multi element arrangements and allocations of the transaction price_ The Group derives revenue from licences and subscriptions of its software and related professional services, which can include; assistance in implementation, customisation and integration, post-contract customer support, and other professional services. In the event that an agreement with the Group’s customers is executed in close proximity to other agreements with the same customer, the Group evaluates whether the separate agreements have a single commercial objective and should be combined; if so, the agreements together are considered a single multi-element arrangement. The Group accounts for individual elements as distinct performance obligations when an element is separately identifiable from other elements in the agreement and if the customer can benefit from the separate element. Where such multiple-element arrangements exist, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling price of each performance obligation is determined based on the best estimate of the current market price of each of the performance obligations when sold separately. In determining the total transaction price, the Group considers the fair value of the consideration, both fixed and variable, to which the Group expects to be entitled and adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the Group with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer, where the period of the financing is over one year. _Sale of and subscription of licences_ Licence revenue is recognised over the period of the related sales agreement, where the licence is considered a right to access IP or the licence is considered a right of use of the software but it is not distinct from post contractual support (“PCS”). In all other circumstances, where the licence is considered a right of use of the software, licence revenue is recognised when the Group has no further obligations to perform in respect of the licence. Where the licence is distinct and separated from the PCS, the PCS revenue is recognised over the PCS period in the sales agreement. _Rendering of services_ Revenue pursuant to time and material professional services contracts are recognised as services are performed. Revenues from fixed-fee professional services contracts are recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known. Revenue from transaction volumes relates to customer use of the Dealogic platform in running capital market transactions. It is billed on a per-transaction basis and is recognised in the same accounting period in which the transaction takes place. _Incremental costs of obtaining contracts_ The Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers that are directly associated with the contract as an asset if those costs are expected to be recoverable and records them in “Intangible assets” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Incremental costs of obtaining contracts are those costs that are incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. F 43 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(u)_ _New standards and interpretations New standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2020_ The following amendments to standards have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements: Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations ........................................................................... 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 3 — In October 2019, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations. _New standards and interpretations effective after 1 January 2020_ Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of relevant standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. Amendments to IFRS 16 COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 June 2021 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark _Reform — Phase 2 ........................................................................................................................ 1 January 2021_ IFRS 9 Financial Instruments — Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for derecognition of _financial liabilities ........................................................................................................................... 1 January 2022_ Amendments to IFRS 16 — In May 2020, IASB issued COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions — Amendment to _IFRS 16 Leases. The amendments provide relief to lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease_ modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. The original amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. In March 2021, the IASB issued _COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021, which extended the availability of the practical expedient by one year. Earlier application is permitted. The Group intends to adopt this amendment when it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform — Phase 2 — The amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical expedients: - A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows that are directly required by the reform, to be treated as changes to a floating interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market rate of interest. - Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations and hedge documentation without hedging relationship being discontinued. - Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component. F 44 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(u)_ _New standards and interpretations (continued) New standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2020 (continued)_ These amendments are effective for the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The amendments apply retrospectively and earlier application is permitted. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of the amendments to the standards. Amendment to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments — Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for derecognition of financial liabilities — The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendment when it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 2. REVENUE The Group derives its revenue from the following product categories and geographical regions as follows: Subscription Transaction Professional revenue revenue services Total _2020_ _2020_ _2020_ _2020 $’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ EMEA ........................................................................................ 54,835 13,012 28,513 96,360 Americas ................................................................................... 70,231 11,951 3,986 86,168 Asia Pacific ..................................................................................... 21,999 5,182 1,681 28,862 147,065 30,145 34,180 211,390 Subscription Transaction Professional revenue revenue services Total _2019_ _2019_ _2019_ _2019 $’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ EMEA . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55,566 10,862 9,987 76,415 Americas . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 63,359 16,599 1,623 81,581 Asia Pacific . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22,012 3,989 567 26,568 140,937 31,450 12,177 184,564 The Group typically invoices clients annually in advance for all contract revenue streams except for professional service revenue, which can be either billed in advance or on satisfaction of milestones. As such, substantially all deferred revenue at the end of an accounting year will be recognised in the following year, with the exception of (i) contracts where revenue recognition is deferred due to uncertainty over payment and (ii) contracts with a significant financing component. Accrued revenue primarily relates to the Group’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. Deferred revenue primarily relates to the advance consideration received from customers for contracts, for which revenue will be recognised on satisfaction of performance obligations in the next reporting period.

(135,237) (142,741) _(d)_ _Circumstances affecting future tax changes:_ The tax charge in future periods will be impacted by any changes to the corporation tax rate in force in the countries in which the Group operates. There is a degree of uncertainty over the level of the future tax rate, due to a combination of factors including US tax reform, future BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) actions and the potential impact of COVID-19 on tax rates internationally. On 3 March 2021 the UK Government announced that legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to increase the main rate of corporation tax to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. This change will impact the Group’s future tax charges and deferred tax balances. The Group estimates that the remeasurement of its UK deferred tax balances would result in an increase to the Group tax charge of $28.6m in the year ended 31 December 2021. F 49 ----- 9.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) _Financial risk_ The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risk. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively. (i) Credit risk _Exposure to credit risk_ Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. _Trade and other receivables_ The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry. The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements. _Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_ Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the financial assets. (ii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements. F 55 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (ii) Liquidity risk (continued) The following are the carrying values and the contractual cashflows of the financial liabilities and long-term employee benefits, including estimated interest payments excluding the impact of netting agreements: Carrying No set Less than One to five Over five value maturity one year years years At 31 December 2020: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Accounts payable and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 124,078 122,653 1,425 — — Lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,086 — 1,941 145 — Loans and related interest payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 591,315 — 22,819 668,628 — 717,479 122,653 26,185 668,773 — Carrying No set Less than One to five Over five value maturity one year years years At 31 December 2019: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Accounts payable and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 111,398 107,856 3,542 — — Lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,082 — 4,214 8,868 — Loans and related interest payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 585,541 — 27,349 706,036 — 710,021 107,856 35,105 714,904 — (iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are dealt with as follows: Currency risk Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management requires all Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place. The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall, the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each currency. The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows: USD EUR At 31 December 2020 _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 83 249 Trade and other receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22,296 92 Debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — (328,171) Net Statement of Financial Position exposure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22,379 F 56 (327,830) ----- 15.

(1,354) (1,435) _Fair values and levelling_ For all material categories of financial assets and financial liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings.

Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement during the year. In valuing the net assets of Selerity on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation techniques, specifically: 1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned. 2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. 3. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin. _Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:_ Fair value of net assets acquired _$’000_ Assets: Cash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 298 Other current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 502 Deferred tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 Property, plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62 Intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,790 Liabilities: Trade and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (Continued) If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, management estimate that Selerity’s revenue would have been $5.0m and loss before tax for the year would have been $0.5m. In determining these amounts management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019. 25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt facilities. I-logic Technologies Bidco Limited acquired the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc.; collectively referred to as “Acuris”. The acquisition of the three Acuris companies was a common control transaction which was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange. Concurrent with the group reorganisation, the newly combined group refinanced the existing debt facilities of both Acuris and the Group by drawing down a new debt facility to repay its existing debt facilities and extended the maturity of both the USD and Euro facilities to 16 February 2028. 26.

The loans carried an interest rate between 0% – 4%. Amounts owed from fellow subsidiary undertakings are repayable on demand. _Expected credit losses on trade receivables_ Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

The recoverable amount is based on six year cashflow projections which have been approved by senior management, which is in line with the period used by management in assessing the business. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future. Cashflow projections are discounted using post-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections between 9% and 12% and cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%. No impairment was indicated. The directors have considered the impact of sensitivities on the key inputs, as listed above, into their impairment review and have concluded that there are no foreseen sensitivities that would result in an impairment charge for the Group at 31 December 2019. 10.

The recoverable amount is based on six year cashflow projections which have been approved by senior management, which is in line with the period used by management in assessing the business. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future. Cashflow projections are discounted using post-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections between 9% and 12% and cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2%. No impairment was indicated. The directors have considered the impact of sensitivities on the key inputs, as listed above, into their impairment review and have concluded that there are no foreseen sensitivities that would result in an impairment charge for the Group at 31 December 2018. 10.

Outstanding customer receivables and contract assets are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1368,EQUITY AND LIABILITIES,1368.52,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2019,1368.52.1,,"1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES _(a)_ _General information_ The financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 28 April 2020. I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, London, EC4R 1BE. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Directors’ Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23. _(b)_ _Basis of preparation_ The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: - Statement of Cash Flows; - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries; - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements; - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures; - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs. The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting their Statement of Comprehensive Income. The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements. The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, considering the below. A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear subscription contracts with customers, which gives a highly visible income stream for the Group. The Group’s forecasts and projections, including reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, show that the Group will continue to generate positive operating cash flows to fund both operations and financing requirements of the Group. _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_ The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2019. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired. Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of the company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, F 78 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641
153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1368,EQUITY AND LIABILITIES,1368.53,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2019 (Continued),1368.53.1,,"1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation (continued)_ together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2019. Financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation. The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principle of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves. _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_ The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements; (i) _Development costs:_ The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance with their accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the expected period of benefits. (ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals. (iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. (iv) _Provision for doubtful debts: For trade receivables, the Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail. (v) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash F 79 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)_ flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Please see note 25 for further details. (vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial measurement of the lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, the group makes judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease, as set out above. _(e)_ _Intangible assets_ Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the separation criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. The useful economic life of intangible assets is between 1 and 20 years. _(f)_ _Research and development costs_ Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied: - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; - there is an ability to use or sell the software product; - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. F 80 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(f)_ _Research and development costs (continued)_ Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit, currently considered to be 3 years. _(g) Goodwill_ Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. _(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amountin order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_ Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Leasehold improvements over the period of lease Computer equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 3 years Right-of-use assets over the period of lease The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition. _(j)_ _Leases Leases as a lessee — the Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a lease if the contract_ conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month or less and leases of low-value assets. F 81 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(j)_ _Leases (continued)_ The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are not included in the lease liability and an estimate of the restoration costs required under the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received. Depreciation on the right-of-use asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset the Group follows the policy of property, plant and equipment, being cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate basis. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments with a corresponding adjustment made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-of-use asset is reduced to zero. The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value items in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. Low-value items comprise IT equipment. _Leases as a lessor — when the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as a finance lease when_ the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted for as an operating lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. The accounting polices applicable to the Group as a lessor in the comparative period were not different from IFRS 16. However, when the Group was an intermediate lessor, the sub-leases were classified with reference to the underlying asset. _(k)_ _Pension costs_ The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. _(l)_ _Provisions for liabilities_ A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. _(m)_ _Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial_ recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Subsequent measurement_ — for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets held by the Group are classified in the following categories: - Financial assets at amortised costs — the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met; (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold F 82 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(m)_ _Financial assets (continued)_ assets to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) based on the contractual terms the expected cashflows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as separate derivatives other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss; are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Impairment of financial assets — the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all_ debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic environment. The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Groups intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities. _Derecognition — a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar_ financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when: - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. _(n)_ _Financial liabilities_ Initial recognition and measurement_ — the Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement_ — the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: - Loans and borrowings — after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. F 83 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(n)_ _Financial liabilities (continued)_ - Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9, as outlined above. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Derecognition of financial liabilities — a liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to_ it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(o)_ _Classification of financial instruments_ An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair value basis. _(p)_ _Foreign currency translation_ Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. _(q)_ _Taxation_ The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in profit or loss. Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted for the period. F 84 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(q)_ _Taxation (continued)_ Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment. _(r)_ _Revenue recognition_ The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue comprises subscriptions and transaction fees, and fees for related services. _Subscription and transaction revenue_ Revenue from subscription services and software licenses is recognised evenly over the period of the subscription/license. Where transaction fees relate to a customer’s investment banking transaction, revenue is recognised when the customer’s transaction completes. Other transaction fees are recognised as revenue on delivery of the related service. _Rendering of services_ Revenue pursuant to time and material professional services contracts are recognised as services are performed. Revenues from fixed-fee professional services contracts are recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known. _Multi element arrangements and allocations of the transaction price_ The Group derives revenue from licenses and subscriptions of its software and related professional services, which can include; assistance in implementation, customisation and integration, post-contract customer support, and other professional services. In the event that an agreement with the Group’s customers is executed in close proximity to other agreements with the same customer, the Group evaluates whether the separate agreements have a single commercial objective and should be combined; if so, the agreements together are considered a single multi-element arrangement. The Group accounts for individual elements as distinct performance obligations when an element is separately identifiable from other elements in the agreement and if the customer can benefit from the separate element. Where such multiple-element arrangements exist, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand alone selling prices. The Stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation is determined based on the best estimate of the current market price of each of the performance obligations when sold separately. F 85 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(r)_ _Revenue recognition (continued)_ In determining the total transaction price, the Group considers the fair value of the consideration, both fixed and variable, to which an entity expects to be entitled and adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer, where the period of the financing is over one year. _(s)_ _New standards and interpretations_ The following standards and amendments have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements: IFRS 16 — Leases The Group has adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach with an initial application date of 1 January 2019. The comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17. On transition, the Group recognised lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘operating leases’. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate as of 1 January 2019. Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payment. In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the Group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard: - applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics. - relying on previous assessments on whether leases are onerous as an alternative to performing an impairment review. - accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at 1 January 2019 as short-term leases. - excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application, - not separating lease and non-lease components, and instead accounting for these as a single component. - and using hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. The Group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease at the date of initial application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date the group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIS) Interpretation 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. For leases that were previously classified as finance leases, the Group measured the right-of-asset and liability at the carrying amount of the finance lease asset and liability immediately before the date of initial application. F 86 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(s)_ _New standards and interpretations (continued)_ On transition to IFRS 16, the Group recognised a $12.6 million of right-of-use assets and $16.9 million lease liabilities. When measuring the lease liabilities, the Group discounted lease payments using its incremental borrowing rate 1 January 2019. The weight-average rate applied is 6.62%.

The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 3 — In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments. The Group intends to adopt the amendments to IFRS 3 when they become effective. Since the amendments apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur on or after the date of first application, the Group will not be affected by these amendments on the date of transition. 2.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES (Continued) _Expected credit losses on trade receivables_ Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables and contract assets are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets using a provision matrix: As at 31 December 2019: _Current_ _30-360_ _Over 360_ _Total _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Expected credit loss rate % . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.10% 0.18% 88.80% Gross carrying amount . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35,503 9,196 60 44,759 Expected credit loss . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The aggregate subscription price was satisfied by way of $400,000,000 cash received and $241,271,000 fair value of shares in Diamond Topco Limited as part of a share-for-share exchange in relation to the acquisition of that company. _SHARE PREMIUM ACCOUNT_ This reserve records the amount above the nominal value received for shares sold. In 2019 the Company undertook a capital reduction, which resulted in the share premium being converted to distributable reserves. _CAPITAL MANAGEMENT_ For the purpose of the Group’s capital management, capital includes issued capital, share premium and all other equity reserves attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. The Group’s capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans. 14.

The Group has a risk management program in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risk, and the Group’s management of capital. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively. (i) Credit risk _Exposure to credit risk_ Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. _Trade and other receivables_ The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry. The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses, as described in note 1(m) and in note 12 to the financial statements. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements. _Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_ Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the assets. F 96 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (ii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements. The following are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and long term employment benefits, including estimated interest payments excluding the impact of netting agreements: Carrying No set Less than One to Over five value maturity one year five years years At 31 December 2019: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Accounts payable and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 111,398 107,856 3,542 — — Lease liabilities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,082 — 4,214 8,868 — Loans and related interest payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 585,541 — 27,349 706,036 — 710,021 107,856 35,105 714,904 — Carrying No set Less than One to Over five value maturity one year five years years At 31 December 2018: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Accounts payable and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 86,929 81,111 947 4,871 — Loans and related interest payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 597,735 — 30,421 130,567 632,432 684,664 81,111 31,368 135,438 632,432 (iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are dealt with as follows: Currency risk Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management requires all Group entities to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place. The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each currency. F 97 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk (continued) Currency risk (continued) The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows: USD EUR At 31 December 2019 _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,213 87 Trade and other receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30,320 74 Debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — (317,051) Gross Statement of Financial Position exposure . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31,533 (316,890) USD EUR At 31 December 2018 _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,202 232 Trade and other receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,275 98 Debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — (323,725) Gross Statement of Financial Position exposure . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,477 (323,395) A 5% strengthening or weakening of the exchange rates in respect of the translation of amounts not denominated in the functional currency of relevant entities into the functional currency would impact on the profit or loss over a one year period by the amounts shown below.

(674) 16,170 Interest rate risk The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. At 31 December 2018 and 2019, the interest on the USD external borrowings was based on USD Libor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of 3.25% and the interest on EUR external borrowings was based on Euribor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of 3.25%. The interest rate profile of the borrowings is: Floating Fixed Interest Interest Rate Rate _$’m_ _$’m_ External borrowings: 2018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 597.7 — 2019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 585.5 — At the year end, there is no foreseen movement in USD or EUR debt floating interest rates that would have any impact on the interest payments, taking into consideration the interest rate floor and the current prevailing floating rates. During the period, the Euribor rate remained below the 1% floor on the Group’s EUR denominated debt. F 98 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk (continued) Interest rate risk (continued) During the period, the USD Libor rate exceeded the 1% floor on the Group’s US Dollar denominated debt. The table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in Libor would have on profit before tax over a one year period: _2019_ _2018 $’000_ _$’000_ Increase/(decrease) on profit before tax: Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR .......................................... 1,435 1,460 Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR ........................................ (1,435) (1,460) _Fair values and levelling_ For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings. 16. LEASES The Group leases land and buildings for its office space. The leases of office space typically run for a period between 1 and 15 years. Refer to note 15(ii) for maturity analysis of lease liabilities and to note 11 for roll forward of right-of-use asset. The impact of transition to IFRS 16 is disclosed in note 1(s). 17.

The parent undertaking of the largest group of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and of which the Company is a member is ION Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. Copies of consolidated financial statements are available from the Companies Registration Office, Parnell Square, Dublin 1, Ireland. 22. PENSION COMMITMENTS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions payable to the funds at the year-end amounted to $0.5 million (2018: $0.1 million). 23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND SECRETARY’S INTERESTS The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales. The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is ITT S.àr.l., a company incorporated in Luxembourg. F 101 ----- 23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND SECRETARY’S INTERESTS (Continued) At the year end, neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor children, held any interests in the shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any other group undertaking, except as follows: Mr. A. Pignataro owned indirectly 100% of ITT S.àr.l. 24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On 12 September 2019, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Selerity Inc (“Selerity”). The identifiable net assets have been included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their provisional acquisition date fair value. The initial assignment of fair value to identifiable net assets acquired and the consideration paid has been performed on a provisional basis given the timing of closure of these transactions. Any amendments to these fair values within the twelve month timeframe from the date of acquisition will be disclosable in the 2020 Annual Report as stipulated by IFRS 3. Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement during the year. In valuing the net assets of Selerity on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation techniques, specifically: 1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned. 2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. 3. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin. _Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed:_ Fair value of net assets acquired _$’000_ Assets: Cash . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 298 Other current assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 502 Deferred tax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22 Property, plant and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62 Intangible assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9,790 Liabilities: Trade and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (Continued) If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, management estimate that Selerity’s revenue would have been $5.0m and loss before tax for the year would have been $0.5m. In determining these amounts management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019. 25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE In March and April 2020, the Group repurchased and extinguished $16.8 million nominal value of the Group’s debt. Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is causing economic disruptions in most countries. Various measures have been taken by Governments around the world to contain the virus which have had a significant impact on global economic activity. The Group’s principle activity is to develop and market data and software solutions, and as such a significant proportion of our projects can be performed remotely. The Group has moved to remote working arrangements which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of our staff and to enable our business to operate with minimal impact. A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with customers with the services provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence limited immediate impact is expected on the Group’s revenue stream. Having considered reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, the directors believe it is still appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. 26. APPROVAL OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Board of Directors approved and authorised for issue the financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2019 on 28 April 2020.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1368,EQUITY AND LIABILITIES,1368.92,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2018,1368.92.1,,"1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES _(a)_ _General information_ The financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 24 April 2019. I-Logic Technologies Bidco Limited is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office address is Level 3, One New Change, London, EC4M 9AF. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Directors’ Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23. _(b)_ _Basis of preparation_ The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: - Statement of Cash Flows; - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries; - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements; - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures; - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs. The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting their Statement of Comprehensive Income. The loss of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2018 was $33.0 million. The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements. The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis having considered anticipated future cash flows. The comparative information has been updated for the finalisation of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of Diamond Topco Limited (“Dealogic”) on 21 December 2017. This has resulting in an increase in goodwill and liabilities acquired as set out in note 24. _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_ The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2018. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired. Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of the company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2018. Financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1368,EQUITY AND LIABILITIES,1368.93,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2018 (Continued),1368.93.1,,"1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation (Continued)_ The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principle of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves. _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_ The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements; (i) _Development costs:_ The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance with their accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the expected period of benefits. (ii) _Tax provisions: The US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted on 22 December 2017. There are a number of impacts for the Group resulting from the US tax reform, which have increased the judgement required as part of the year end tax provision process. The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals. (iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. For trade receivables, the Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail. (iv) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Similarly, judgement was required for the day one fair value of shares issued as part of the consideration for the business combination. Please see note 10 and 24 for further details. F 119 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(e)_ _Intangible assets_ Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the separation criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. The useful economic life of intangible assets is between 1 and 20 years. _(f)_ _Research and development costs_ Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied: - it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; - management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; - there is an ability to use or sell the software product; - it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; - adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and - the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit, currently considered to be 3 years. _(g)_ _Goodwill_ Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, F 120 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(g)_ _Goodwill (continued)_ the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. _(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_ Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Leasehold improvements .............................................. over the period of lease Computer equipment ..................................................... 3 years Fixtures and fittings ........................................................ 3 years The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition. _(j)_ _Leases_ Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Rentals payable under operating leases, net of any incentives received from the lessor, are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users benefit. The Group has no finance leases. _(k)_ _Pension costs_ The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. _(l)_ _Provisions for liabilities_ A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. F 121 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(m)_ _Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement — the Group determines the classification of its financial assets on initial_ recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. Subsequent measurement_ — for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets held by the Group are classified in the following categories: - Financial assets at amortised costs — the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met; (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) based on the contractual terms the expected cashflows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. - Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as separate derivatives other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss; are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Impairment of financial assets — the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all_ debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic environment. The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Groups intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities. _Derecognition — a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar_ financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when: - The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or - The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. F 122 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(n)_ _Financial liabilities_ Initial recognition and measurement_ — the Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement_ — the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below: - Loans and borrowings — after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. - Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss — these include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9, as outlined above. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Derecognition of financial liabilities — a liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to_ it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(o)_ _Classification of financial instruments_ An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IFRS 9. The initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair value basis. _(p)_ _Foreign currency translation_ Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. F 123 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(q)_ _Taxation_ The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in profit or loss. Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted for the period. Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment. _(r)_ _Revenue recognition_ The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue comprises subscriptions and transaction fees, and fees for related services. _Subscription and transaction revenue_ Revenue from subscription services and software licenses is recognised evenly over the period of the subscription/license. Where transaction fees relate to a customer’s investment banking transaction, revenue is recognised when the customer’s transaction completes. Other transaction fees are recognised as revenue on delivery of the related service. _Rendering of services_ Revenue pursuant to time and material professional services contracts are recognised as services are performed. Revenues from fixed-fee professional services contracts are recognised based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. This is determined based on the actual labour hours spent relative to the total expected labour hours. Estimates of revenues, costs or extent of progress toward completion are revised if circumstances change. Any resulting increases or decreases in estimated revenues or costs are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise to the revision become known. _Multi element arrangements and allocations of the transaction price_ The Group derives revenue from licenses and subscriptions of its software and related professional services, which can include; assistance in implementation, customisation and integration, post-contract customer support, and other professional services. In the event that an agreement with the Group’s customers is executed in close proximity to other agreements with the same customer, the Group evaluates whether the separate agreements have a single commercial objective and should be combined; if so, the agreements together are considered a single multi-element arrangement. F 124 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(r)_ _Revenue recognition (Continued)_ The Group accounts for individual elements as distinct performance obligations when an element is separately identifiable from other elements in the agreement and if the customer can benefit from the separate element. Where such multiple-element arrangements exist, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the stand alone selling prices. The Stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation is determined based on the best estimate of the current market price of each of the performance obligations when sold separately. In determining the total transaction price, the Group considers the fair value of the consideration, both fixed and variable, to which an entity expects to be entitled and adjusts the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract (either explicitly or implicitly) provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer, where the period of the financing is over one year. _(s)_ _New standards and interpretations_ The following standards and amendments have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements: IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments The Group has adopted IFRS 9 with an initial application date of 1 January 2018. The comparative information continues to be reported under IAS 39 with differences arising from the adoption of IFRS 9 recognised in retained earnings. On transition, the Group classified all financial assets at amortised cost. The adoption of IFRS 9 has not had a significant effect on the Group’s accounting policies, with the exception of the application of ECLs as outlined in the accounting policies above. On transition the provision on trade receivables increased as a result of the movement from the incurred loss model under IAS 39 to the expected credit loss model under IFRS 9, this difference, net of tax, at the adoption date gives rise to the transitional adjustment reflected in retained earnings. The reconciliation of the ending impairment allowances in accordance with IAS 39 to the opening loss allowances determined in accordance with IFRS 9 is set out in note 12. Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of relevant standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. IFRS 16 – Leases ........................................................................................................................................ 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatment..................................................................... 1 January 2019 IFRS 16 — IFRS 16 was issued in January 2016 and it replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases-Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. IFRS 16 requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17, with the exception of low value leases and short term leases. the commencement date of a lease, a lessee will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense on the lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. The Group plans to adopt IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach, without any adjustments to the comparative period. The detailed impact review along with quantification of this standard is currently under way; however, the Group anticipates that the impact of adoption of IFRS 16 will result in the recognition of a lease liability, a right of use asset. The impact on profit or loss will be to reduce the operating expenses and increase depreciation and interest expense for the Group. IFRIC 23 — The Interpretation addresses the accounting for income taxes when tax treatments involve uncertainty that affects the application of IAS 12. The Interpretation specifically addresses the unit of account F 125 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(s)_ _New standards and interpretations (Continued)_ for tax uncertainties, and how an entity determines the quantification of the tax uncertainty. Since the Group operates in a complex multinational tax environment, applying the Interpretation may affect its consolidated financial statements, this assessment is currently under review. 2.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) _Financial risk_ The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management program in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risk, and the Group’s management of capital. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively. (i) Credit risk _Exposure to credit risk_ Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. _Trade and other receivables_ The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry. The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses, as described in note 1(m) and in note 12 to the financial statements. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements. _Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_ Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the assets. (ii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements. F 134 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (ii) Liquidity risk (continued) The following are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and long term employment benefits, including estimated interest payments excluding the impact of netting agreements: Carrying No set Less than One to five Over five value maturity one year years years At 31 December 2018: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Accounts payable and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 86,929 81,111 947 4,871 — Loans and related interest payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 597,735 — 30,421 130,567 632,432 684,664 81,111 31,368 135,438 632,432 Carrying No set L ss than One to five Over five value maturity one year years years At 31 December 2017: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Accounts payable and other payables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 69,248 — 69,248 — — Loans and related interest payable . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 641,598 — 45,563 175,990 648,910 710,846 — 114,811 175,990 648,910 (iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are dealt with as follows: Currency risk Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management requires all Group entities to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place. The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each currency. The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows: USD EUR At 31 December 2018 _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5,202 232 Trade and other receivables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,275 98 Debt . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . — (323,725) Gross Statement of Financial Position exposure . . . . . . . . . . . 13,477 (323,395) A 5% strengthening or weakening of the exchange rates in respect of the translation of amounts not denominated in the functional currency of relevant entities into the function currency would impact on the profit or loss over a one year period by the amounts shown below.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk (Continued) Interest rate risk The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. At 31 December 2018, the interest on the USD external borrowings was based on USD Libor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of 3.25% and the interest on EUR external borrowings was based on Euribor (subject to a floor of 1%) plus a margin of 3.25%. The interest rate profile of the borrowings is: Floating Fixed Interest Rate Interest Rate _$’m_ _$’m_ External borrowings: 2017 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 640.6 — 2018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 597.7 — At the year end, there is no foreseen movement in USD or EUR debt floating interest rates that would have any impact on the interest payments, taking into consideration the interest rate floor and the current prevailing floating rates. During the period, the Euribor rate remained below the 1% floor on the Group’s EUR denominated debt. During the period, the USD Libor rate exceeded the 1% floor on the Group’s US Dollar denominated debt. The table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in Libor would have on profit before tax over a one year period: Increase/(decrease) on profit before tax: _$’000 Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR ........................................... 1,460 Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR......................................... (1,460) _Fair values and levelling_ For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings. 16.

The parent undertaking of the largest group of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and of which the Company is a member is ION Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. Copies of consolidated financial statements are available from the Companies Registration Office, Parnell Square, Dublin 1, Ireland. 22. PENSION COMMITMENTS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions payable to the funds at the year-end amounted to $0.1 million (2017: $0.1 million). 23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND SECRETARY’S INTERESTS The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is I-Logic Technologies UK Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales. The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is ITT S.àr.l., a company incorporated in Luxembourg. At the year end, neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor children, held any interests in the shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any other group undertaking, except as follows: Mr. A. Pignataro owned indirectly 100% of ITT S.àr.l. 24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS The comparative information has been updated for the finalisation of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of Diamond Topco Limited (“Dealogic”) on 21 December 2017. During the measurement period the Company has obtained further information on the quantum of liabilities and accruals on the acquisition date, as a result there in an increase in the goodwill and liabilities acquired of $10,000,000, which have been adjusted in the comparative period. On 21 December 2017, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Diamond Topco Limited (“Dealogic”) for total consideration of $994.5m. The identifiable net assets have been included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their provisional acquisition date fair value. The initial assignment of fair value to identifiable net assets acquired and the consideration paid has been performed on a provisional basis given the timing of closure of these transactions. Any amendments to these fair values within the twelve month timeframe from the date of acquisition will be disclosable in the 2018 Annual Report as stipulated by IFRS 3. Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement during the prior period. In valuing the net assets of Dealogic on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation techniques, specifically: 1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the patents or trademarks being owned. 2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. 3. Replacement Cost, which considers the value of databases owned by estimating the costs that a market participant would incur to replace the asset. 4. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin. F 139 ----- 24.

(72,827) 680,363 If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017, management estimate that consolidated revenue would have been $164.8m and consolidated loss before tax for the year would have been $83.2m. In determining these amounts management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, determined provisionally, that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2017. 25.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES _(a)_ _General information_ The consolidated financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 January 2022. Acuris International Limited is a private company limited by shares which was incorporated on 18 April 2019 in England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, 2[nd] Floor, London, EC4R 1BE, United Kingdom. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Strategic Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23. _(b)_ _Basis of preparation_ The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Adopted IFRSs’). The Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: - Statement of Cash Flows; - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries; - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements; - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures; - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs. The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements. The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis. The consolidated financial statements are presented in USD, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated. The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and therefore the comparative numbers are for the period from this date to 31 December 2019 whereas the results for the year ended 31 December 2020 represent a full year of operations. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the 'period of assessment').

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1368,EQUITY AND LIABILITIES,1368.126,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 31 December 2020 (Continued),1368.126.1,,"1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(b)_ _Basis of preparation (continued)_ The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, business performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from recurring revenues that are billed upfront for services that are critical to our customer’s operations and these services can be performed remotely by the Group. The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and downsize case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities (see note 15 for the details on the loans and note 25 for details on the post year end refinancing). As a result of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group and the Company is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months. _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_ The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2020. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired. Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of the Company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2020. Financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation. The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principles of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves. F - 163 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_ The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements and estimates have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements: (i) _Development costs: The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance with the accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the expected period of benefits. (ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals. (iii) _Provisions and accruals: In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. (iv) _Provision for doubtful debts: The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail. (v) _Business combinations: As part of a business combination, the assets and liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these F - 164 ----- intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)_ In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Please see notes 9 and 24 for further details. (vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial measurement of the lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, the group makes judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease. _(e)_ _Intangible assets_ Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the recognition criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The useful economic lives of intangible assets with finite lives are as follow: Trademarks 20 years Customer lists 25 years Databases 5 years Contract costs 1 year Software 6 years Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the F - 165 ----- net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(f)_ _Research and development costs_ Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied: � it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; � management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; � there is an ability to use or sell the software product; � it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; � adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and � the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit. The current weighted average life of capitalised development costs is 3 years (2019: 3 years). _(g)_ _Goodwill_ Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. _(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for F - 166 ----- an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets (continued)_ asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_ Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Computer equipment 3 years Right-of-use assets over the period of lease Fixtures and fittings 5 years The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition. _(j)_ _Investment in subsidiaries_ Investments in subsidiaries are initially recognised at cost, being either the value of the capital injected into a subsidiary through subscription of shares or by way of a capital contribution, or the amount of consideration paid to another group entity under common control for the equity shares issued by the subsidiary. Subsequent to initial measurement, the investment in subsidiary is carried at cost less impairment. _(k)_ _Leases Leases as a lessee_ The Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month or less and leases of low-value assets. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are not included in the lease liability and an estimate of the restoration costs required under the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received. Depreciation on the right-ofuse asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of F - 167 ----- subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset, the Group follows the policy for property, plant and equipment, being cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(k)_ _Leases (continued)_ measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments and corresponding adjustment of such remeasurement is made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-of-use asset is reduced to zero. The Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease commitment. The Group has elected to account for short-term leases and leases of low-value items in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. _Leases as a lessor_ When the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as a finance lease when, the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted for as an operating lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. _(l)_ _Pension costs_ The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. _(m)_ _Provisions for liabilities_ A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. _(n)_ _Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement - the Group determines the classification of its_ financial assets on initial recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. F - 168 ----- _Subsequent measurement - for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets_ held by the Group are classified in the following categories: 1._ ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(n)_ _Financial assets (continued)_ � Financial assets at amortised cost – the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met: (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and (ii) based on the contractual terms, the expected cashflows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. � Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as separate derivatives, other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Impairment of financial assets - the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit_ losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For trade receivables, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic environment. The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Group’s intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities. F - 169 ----- _Derecognition - a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part_ of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when: � The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or � The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(o)_ _Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement - the Group determines the classification of its_ financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. _Subsequent measurement - the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their_ classification, as described below: � Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. � Loans and borrowings - after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Derecognition of financial liabilities - a liability is generally derecognised when the_ contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(p)_ _Fair value measurement of financial instruments_ When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the Statement of Financial Position cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these models are taken from F - 170 ----- observable markets where possible. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and the selection of appropriate discount curves, and other market inputs. _(q)_ _Classification of financial instruments_ An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair value basis. 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(r)_ _Foreign currency translation_ Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. _(s)_ _Taxation_ The tax expense for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity, otherwise, income tax is recognised in profit or loss. Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted for the financial year. F - 171 ----- Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Company to make a single net payment. 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(t)_ _Revenue recognition_ The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue comprises subscriptions to information products, and research report and event revenues. _Subscription revenue_ Revenue from subscription services is recognised evenly over the period of the subscription. _Research report and event revenues_ Revenue from research reports and events is recognised in the same accounting period in which the report is published, or event is held. _Incremental costs of obtaining contracts_ The Group recognises the incremental costs of obtaining contracts with customers that are directly associated with the contract as an asset if those costs are expected to be recoverable and records them in “Intangible assets” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Incremental costs of obtaining contracts are those costs that are incurred to obtain a contract with a customer that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained. _(u)_ _New standards and interpretations New standards and interpretations effective 1 January 2020_ The following amendments to standards have been adopted for the first time in these financial statements: Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 3 - In October 2019, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market F - 172 ----- participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, but may impact future periods should the Group enter into any business combinations. _New standards and interpretations effective after 1 January 2020_ Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. This listing is of relevant standards and interpretations issued, which the Group reasonably expects to be applicable at a future date. F - 173 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(u)_ _New standards and interpretations (continued)_ Amendments to IFRS 16 COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions 1 June 2021 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2_ 1 January 2021 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for _derecognition of financial liabilities_ 1 January 2022 Amendments to IFRS 16 - In May 2020, IASB issued _COVID-19-Related Rent _Concessions_ _- Amendment to IFRS 16_ _Leases. The amendments provide relief to_ lessees from applying IFRS 16 guidance on lease modification accounting for rent concessions arising as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a practical expedient, a lessee may elect not to assess whether a COVID-19 related rent concession from a lessor is a lease modification. A lessee that makes this election accounts for any change in lease payments resulting from the COVID-19 related rent concession the same way it would account for the change under IFRS 16, if the change were not a lease modification. The original amendment applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 June 2020. In March 2021, the IASB issued COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021, which extended the availability of the practical expedient by one year. Earlier application is permitted. The Group intends to adopt this amendment when it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 _Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2_    - The amendments provide temporary reliefs which address the financial reporting effects when an interbank offered rate (IBOR) is replaced with an alternative nearly risk-free rate (RFR). The amendments include the following practical expedients: � A practical expedient to require contractual changes, or changes to cash flows that are directly required by the reform, to be treated as changes to a floating interest rate, equivalent to a movement in a market rate of interest. � Permit changes required by IBOR reform to be made to hedge designations and hedge documentation without hedging relationship being discontinued. � Provide temporary relief to entities from having to meet the separately identifiable requirement when an RFR instrument is designated as a hedge of a risk component. These amendments are effective for the annual period beginning on or after 1 January 2021. The amendments apply retrospectively and earlier application is permitted. The Group is in the process of assessing the impact, if any, of the amendments to the standards. F - 174 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(u)_ _New standards and interpretations (continued)_ Amendment to IFRS 9 _Financial Instruments - Fees in the ’10 per cent’ test for _derecognition of financial liabilities - The amendment clarifies the fees that an entity_ includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modified financial liability are substantially different from the terms of the original financial liability. These fees include only those paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other’s behalf. An entity applies the amendment to financial liabilities that are modified or exchanged on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendment. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 with earlier adoption permitted. The Group will apply the amendment when it becomes effective but currently does not expect to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group. 2.

REVENUE (Continued) The Group typically invoices clients in advance for all revenue streams. As such, substantially all deferred revenue at the end of an accounting year will be recognised in the following year. In addition to the contract balances disclosed below, the Group has also recognised a contract asset in relation to costs to obtain a contract.

There is a degree of uncertainty over the level of the future tax rate, due to a combination of factors including US tax reform, future BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) actions and the potential impact of COVID-19 on tax rates internationally. On 3 March 2021 the UK Government announced that legislation will be introduced in the Finance Bill 2021 to increase the main rate of corporation tax to 25% with effect from 1 April 2023. This change will impact the Group’s future tax charges and deferred tax balances. The Group estimates that the remeasurement of its UK deferred tax balances would result in a decrease to the Group tax charge of $0.3m in the year ended 31 December 2021. F - 182 ----- ----- ----- 9. INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS (Continued) _Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives impairment review_ The Group performed its annual impairment test in December 2020. The recoverable amount is based either on cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management or observable EBITDA or revenue multiples as adjusted and applied to the forecasted EBITDA. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount rate applied, future growth rate of the revenue and the operating margin. These take into account the existing customer base and expected revenue commitments from it, anticipated additional sales to existing and new customers, planned expansion of product and service offerings to the marketplace and the specific market trends that are currently seen and those expected in the future. Where cashflow projections are used they are discounted using pre-tax discount rates applied to cash flow projections between 8% and 10% and cash flows beyond the projection period are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate. No impairments were indicated (2019: none indicated). Goodwill is allocated to one cash generating unit (2019: one). 10.

Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are noninterest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments with similar loss patterns. The calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of at least 6 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) _Financial risk_ The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risk. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively. (i) Credit risk _Exposure to credit risk_ Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. _Trade and other receivables_ The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry. The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements. _Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_ Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the financial assets. F 192 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (ii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity risk is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements. The following are the carrying values and the contractual cashflows of the financial liabilities and long-term employee benefits, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: At 31 December Carrying No set Less than One to Over five 2020: value maturity one year five years years _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Accounts payable and other payables 73,662     - 73,662     -     Lease liabilities 21,634     - 7,325 17,346     Loans and related interest payable 1,273,109     - 107,461 1,787,909 1,368,405               - 188,448 1,805,255 At 31 December Carrying No set Less than One to Over five 2019: value maturity one year five years years _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Accounts payable and other payables 30,394     - 30,394     -     Lease liabilities 27,538     - 8,160 24,441 7 Loans and related interest payable 1,195,464     - 101,961 509,807 1,283,244 1,253,396               - 140,515 534,248 1,283,251 F 193 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are dealt with as follows: Currency risk Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management requires all Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place. The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall, the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each currency and additionally financing any acquisitions of significant transactions in the currency of the acquired entity or acquired asset. The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows: USD GBP EUR At 31 December 2020: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents 3,418 141 187 Trade and other receivables 9,339 2,263 767 Debt     -     - (826,624) Net Statement of Financial Position exposure 12,757 2,404 (825,670) F 194 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk (continued) Currency risk (continued) USD GBP EUR At 31 December 2019: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents 3,097 1,593 100 Trade and other receivables 4,531 493 496 Debt     -     - (753,803) Net Statement of Financial Position exposure 7,628 2,086 (753,207) A 5% strengthening or weakening of the exchange rates in respect of the translation of amounts not denominated in the functional currency of relevant entities into the functional currency would impact on the profit before tax by the amounts shown below. This assumes that all other variables remain constant. At 31 December 2020: USD GBP EUR Impact on profit before tax _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Impact of 5% strengthening 671 127 (43,456) Impact of 5% weakening (607) (115) 39,318 At 31 December 2019: USD GBP EUR Impact on profit before tax _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Impact of 5% strengthening 401 110 (39,642) Impact of 5% weakening (363) (99) 35,867 Interest rate risk The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. The table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in LIBOR would have on profit before tax over a one year period. 2020 2019 _$’000_ _$’000_ Increase / (decrease) on profit before tax: Impact of a 50-basis point increase in (6.3) (6.2) LIBOR Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in 6.3 6.2 LIBOR _Fair values and levelling_ For all material categories of financial assets and financial liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank F 195 ----- overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk (continued) Interest rate risk (continued) Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings.

PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND SECRETARY’S INTERESTS The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Acuris Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales. The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is Bessel Capital S.ár.l, a company incorporated in Luxembourg. The parent undertaking of the smallest and largest groups of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and of which the Company is a member are Acuris Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales and ION Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated in Ireland. Neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor children, held any interests in the shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any other group undertaking, except as follows: At the year end, Mr. A. Pignataro owned directly 100% (2019: 100%) of Bessel Capital S.àr.l. 24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On 11 July 2019, the Group acquired 100% of the controlling interest in Mergermarket Topco Limited (“Acuris”) for total consideration of $847.2m. The identifiable net assets were included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their acquisition date fair value and there has been no changes to the acquisition date fair values. Transaction expenses of $6.8m related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement under operating expenses in the period. In valuing the net assets of Acuris on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation techniques, specifically: 1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the trademarks and Information Technology being owned. 2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. 3. Replacement Cost, which considers the value of databases owned by estimating the costs that a market participant would incur to replace the asset. 4. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participant profit margin. F 202 ----- 24.

In determining these amounts management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019. Since the acquisition date, the Group has recorded revenues amounting to $136.2 and consolidated loss amounting to $62.0 in the consolidated income statement from this acquisition. F 203 ----- 25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt facilities. The Company sold its holdings in Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc to I-logic Technologies Bidco Limited. The sale was a common control transaction which was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange. Concurrent with the group reorganisation, the newly combined group refinanced the existing debt facilities by drawing down a new debt facility to repay its existing debt facilities. The new debt extends the maturity of both the USD and Euro facilities to 16 February 2028. 26. REVISIONS TO THE 2020 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS The annual report and financial statements have been revised and will be resubmitted to the UK Companies House and replace the original annual report and financial statements that were approved by the Directors on 11 April 2021. This revised annual report and financial statements are now the statutory financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2020. The revised annual report and financial statements have been prepared as at the date of the original annual report and financial statements and not as at the date of revision and accordingly do not deal with events between those dates. A revision by replacement was deemed necessary after it was identified that the Group had not recognised deferred tax assets. For the financial year ended 31 December 2020, the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets associated with interest on borrowings as restricted by the Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom (UK) as management believed that there was not sufficient future taxable income from which the restricted interest and tax losses could be utilised. However, the Group had not considered the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of Acuris Group in 2019. In addition, the Group revisited the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As a consequence, deferred tax liabilities were overstated and the following amendments to the original annual accounts were made in these revised financial statements: Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Accounts Original 2020 Revised 2020 Annual Annual Accounts Adjustments Accounts _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Tax on loss 9,885 28,005 37,890 Loss for the financial year (202,802) 28,005 (174,797) Total comprehensive loss (200,499) 28,005 (172,494) F 204 ----- 26._ REVISIONS TO THE 2020 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS (continued) Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Accounts Original Revised 2020 2020 Annual FY 2019 FY 2020 Annual Accounts Adjustments Adjustments Accounts _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Intangible assets 1,944,777 (4,969)     - 1,939,808 Deferred tax asset 8,549 (3,830) (4,388) 331 Total non-current assets 1,974,620 (8,799) (4,388) 1,961,433 Total asset 2,064,220 (8,799) (4,388) 2,051,033 Retained deficit (264,846) 6,437 28,005 (230,404) Total equity 271,821 6,437 28,005 306,263 Deferred tax liabilities 184,160 (15,236) (32,393) 136,531 Total non-current liabilities 1,477,501 (15,236) (32,393) 1,429,872 Total liabilities 1,792,399 (15,236) (32,393) 1,744,770 Total liabilities and equity 2,064,220 (8,799) (4,388) 2,051,033 The directors also revised the financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2019 to correct those financial statements.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES _(a)_ _General information_ The financial statements for the Group were authorised for issue by the directors on 20 January 2022. Acuris International Limited is a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales. The registered office address is 10 Queen Street Place, 2[nd] Floor, London, EC4R 1BE, United Kingdom. The principal activities of the Company and its subsidiaries are described in the Strategic Report. The ultimate parent undertaking is disclosed in note 23. _(b)_ _Basis of preparation_ The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS issued by the IASB. References to IFRS hereafter refer to IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures: - Statement of Cash Flows; - Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries; - Certain requirements of IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements; - Disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures; - Disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement; and - The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs. The Company has availed of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting their Statement of Comprehensive Income. The accounting policies described below apply equally to the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements. The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments which are carried at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency. All values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($’000), except where otherwise indicated. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as the directors are confident that the company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, considering the below. A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from subscription contracts with customers, which gives a highly visible income stream for the Group. The Group's forecasts and projections, including reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, show that the Group will continue to generate positive operating cash flows to fund both operations and financing requirements of the Group. The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and for this reason no comparative information is presented. F - 226 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(c)_ _Basis of consolidation_ The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings prepared to 31 December 2019. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary, except for common control transactions as detailed below. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Upon the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired. Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings are prepared to a year end that differs from that of the company, the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements in respect of these subsidiary undertakings are represented by their latest financial statements prepared to their respective year ends, together with management accounts for the intervening periods to 31 December 2019. Financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared using consistent accounting policies. All intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full on consolidation. The Group accounts for group reconstructions and common control transactions under the principle of predecessor accounting, and the comparative periods are represented as if the entities had been part of the same group from the earliest date they were under common control. On consolidation, any difference (merger adjustment) between the carrying value of the investment in the subsidiary and the aggregate of the nominal value of the subsidiary’s shares, together with any share premium account and capital redemption reserve of the subsidiary is taken to other reserves. _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_ The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the Statement of Financial Position date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates. The following judgements (apart from those involving estimates) have had the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements: (i) _Development costs: The Group capitalises development costs for development projects in accordance with their accounting policy. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on management’s judgement that technological and economic feasibility is confirmed. In determining the amounts to be capitalised, management makes assumptions regarding the expected future cash generation of the project, and the expected period of benefits. (ii) _Tax provisions: The determination of the Group’s provision for income tax requires certain judgements and estimates in relation to matters where the ultimate tax outcome may not be certain. F - 227 ----- F - 228 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(d)_ _Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (Continued)_ The recognition or non-recognition of deferred tax assets as appropriate also requires judgement as it involves an assessment of the future recoverability of those assets. Although management believes that the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable, there is no certainty that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in the Group’s income tax provisions and accruals. (iii) _Provisions and accruals:_ In determining the fair value of the provision, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to the expected cost to settle the obligation and the expected timing of those costs. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. (iv) _Provision for doubtful debts:_ For trade receivables, the Group uses a provision matrix to calculate the expected credit loss (ECL). The provision matrix is based on days past due, initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates by customer segment. In determining the provision matrix, a significant judgement exists in determining the correlation between historically observed default rates, current and future economic conditions. The Group’s historical observed default rates as adjusted by future economic conditions may not be representative of the future actual default rates. Please see note 12 for further detail. (v) _Business combinations:_ As part of a business combination the assets and liabilities of the acquired group are brought onto the Consolidated Statement of Financial position at their fair values. There are a number of significant judgements used in determining the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Business combinations may also result in intangible benefits being brought into the Group, some of which qualify for recognition as intangible assets while other such benefits do not meet the recognition requirements of IFRS and therefore form part of goodwill. Judgement is required in the assessment and valuation of these intangible assets, including assumptions on the timing and amount of future cash flows generated by the assets and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. In subsequent periods after the fair values have been finalised, these assets are subject to annual impairment testing. Please see note 10 and 24 for further details. (vi) _Discount rates used in measurement of lease liabilities: In determining the initial measurement of the lease liability, the group discounts lease payments using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate (IBR), where the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. The IBR is the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. In determining the IBR, the group makes judgement on the selection of appropriate benchmark rates and necessary adjustments to reflect the specific circumstances of the lease, as set out above. F - 229 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(e)_ _Intangible assets_ Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition, if they satisfy the separation criteria. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitalised and expenditure is reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over their useful economic lives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life, or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for by changing the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised, but are tested for impairment annually. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the asset is derecognised. The useful economic life of intangible assets is between 1 and 25 years. _(f)_ _Research and development costs_ Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when all of the following criteria are satisfied: � it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that it will be available for use; � management intends to complete the software product and use or sell it; � there is an ability to use or sell the software product; � it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate probable future economic benefits; � adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the software product are available; and � the expenditure attributable to the software product during its development can be reliably measured. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. Following initial recognition of the development expenditure as an asset, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation F - 230 ----- and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete, and the asset is available for use. It is amortised evenly over the period of expected future benefit, currently considered to be 3 years. F - 231 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(g)_ _Goodwill_ Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured at fair value is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the cash generating units (CGUs), or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. Goodwill impairment reviews are undertaken annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. _(h)_ _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s (or cash-generating unit) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined at the individual asset level, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(i)_ _Property, plant and equipment_ Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost comprises the amount paid and the costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Computer equipment 3 years Right of use assets Over the period of the lease Fixtures and fittings 5 years The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of the asset is included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period of derecognition. F - 232 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(j)_ _Leases Leases as a lessee - the Group accounts for a contract or a part of a contract as a_ lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. On the commencement of a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases except short term leases that have a lease term of 12 month or less and leases of low-value assets. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at the amount of the lease liability plus any initial direct costs incurred, any initial payments which have already been made but are not included in the lease liability and an estimate of the restoration costs required under the terms of the lease less any lease incentives received. Depreciation on the right-ofuse asset is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term. For purposes of subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset the Group follows the policy of property, plant and equipment, being cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term that are not paid at commencement date, discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate basis. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments with a corresponding adjustment made to the carrying amount of right-of-use asset unless the carrying value of right-ofuse asset is reduced to zero. The Group has elected to account for short-term leases in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term. _Leases as a lessor - when the Group is a lessor, the Group accounts for the leases as_ a finance lease when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the underlying asset, otherwise the lease is accounted for as an operating lease on a straight line basis through profit or loss. When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. _(k)_ _Pension costs_ The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. Contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income and recognised as employee benefit expenses as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme. F - 233 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(l)_ _Provisions for liabilities_ A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. _(m)_ _Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement - the Group determines the classification of its_ financial assets on initial recognition. The classification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash flow characteristics and the Group’s business model for managing them. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component or for which the Group has applied the practical expedient, the Group initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. _Subsequent measurement - for purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets_ held by the Group are classified in the following categories: � Financial assets at amortised costs – the Group measures financial assets at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met; (i) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) based on the contractual terms the expected cashflows are solely payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method, less impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. � Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss, or financial assets mandatorily required to be measured at fair value. Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are accounted for as separate derivatives other than those designated at fair value through profit or loss; are classified as held for trading. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Impairment of financial assets - the Group recognises an allowance for expected credit_ losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. F - 234 ----- F - 235 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(m)_ _Financial assets (Continued)_ For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the trade receivable and the economic environment. The Group considers default to occur when contractual payments are outstanding greater than 360 days past due based on historical experience, however given the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets, the definition of default has no impact on the quantification of the provision. Trade receivables are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cashflows, which is based on an assessment of the Group’s intention and ability to successfully recover balances through enforcement activities. _Derecognition - a financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or_ part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group’s consolidated Statement of Financial Position) when: � The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or � The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. _(n)_ _Financial liabilities Initial recognition and measurement - the Company determines the classification of its_ financial liabilities at initial recognition. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. _Subsequent measurement - the measurement of financial liabilities depends on their_ classification, as described below: � Loans and borrowings - after initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. � Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss - these include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. This includes derivatives not in a hedging F - 236 ----- relationship and embedded derivatives that meet the separation criteria in IFRS 9, as outlined above. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are carried 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(n)_ _Financial liabilities (Continued)_ in the Statement of Financial Position at fair value with net changes in fair value presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _Derecognition of financial liabilities - a liability is generally derecognised when the_ contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires. Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. _(o)_ _Classification of financial instruments_ An instrument or its components, are classified on initial recognition as a financial asset, financial liability or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the requirements of IAS 32. The initial carrying value of a compound instruments are allocated between the financial liability components and equity components, by first valuing the financial liability on a stand-alone basis and allocating the residual value to the equity component. Transaction costs are allocated between the components on a relative fair value basis. _(p)_ _Foreign currency translation_ Items included in the financial statements of each individual Group entity are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. For each entity, the Group determines the functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency. On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date and their statements of comprehensive income are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation and any fair value adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities arising on the acquisition F - 237 ----- are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the spot rate of exchange at the reporting date. F - 238 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(q)_ _Taxation_ The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is charged or credited to other comprehensive income if it relates to items that are charged or credited to other comprehensive income. Similarly, current tax is charged or credited to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged directly to equity. Otherwise income tax is recognised in profit or loss. Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted for the period. Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, except for deferred tax assets which are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset, only if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxation authority and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment. _(r)_ _Revenue recognition_ The Group recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue comprises subscriptions to information products, and research report and event revenues. _Subscription revenues_ Revenue from subscription services is recognised evenly over the period of the subscription. _Research report and event revenues_ Revenue from research reports and events is recognised in the same accounting period in which the report is published or event is held. F - 239 ----- 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(s)_ _New standards and interpretations_ Relevant standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Group’s financial statements are listed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective. Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 3 - In October 2018, the IASB issued amendments to the definition of a business in IFRS 3 Business Combinations to help entities determine whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business or not. They clarify the minimum requirements for a business, remove the assessment of whether market participants are capable of replacing any missing elements, add guidance to help entities assess whether an acquired process is substantive, narrow the definitions of a business and of outputs, and introduce an optional fair value concentration test. New illustrative examples were provided along with the amendments. The Group intends to adopt the amendments to IFRS 3 when they become effective. Since the amendments apply prospectively to transactions or other events that occur on or after the date of first application, the Group will not be affected by these amendments on the date of transition. 2. REVENUE The revenue for the period was derived from the Group’s principal activity and is attributable to geographical markets as follows: Subscription Research and Total revenue report and event revenue _18 Apr 2019_ _18 Apr 2019_ _18 Apr 2019 to 31 Dec_ _to 31 Dec_ _to 31 Dec 2019_ _2019_ _2019 $’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ EMEA 54,127 4,774 58,901 Americas 46,489 767 47,256 Asia Pacific 18,721 11,275 29,996 119,337 16,816 136,153 The Group typically invoices customers annually in advance for all subscription revenue streams.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Group _2019 $’000_ Trade receivables 65,035 Prepayments 3,679 Other debtors 4,472 73,186 _Expected credit losses on trade receivables_ Customer credit risk is managed by each business unit subject to the Group’s established policy, procedures and control relating to customer credit risk management. Outstanding customer receivables and contract assets are regularly monitored. Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally issued with credit terms of 0 – 30 days. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using the provision matrix below to measure the ECL. The provision rates are based on days past due and the calculation of the ECL reflects reasonable and supportable information that is available at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Loss rates are based on actual credit loss experience over a period of 2 years. These rates are multiplied by scalar factors to reflect differences between economic conditions during the period over which the historical data has been collected, current conditions and the Group’s view of economic conditions over the expected lives of the receivables. Set out below is the information about the credit risk exposure on the Group’s trade receivables and contract assets using a provision matrix: As at 31 December 2019: _Current_ _30-360_ _Over 360_ _Total Expected credit loss rate % 0.20% 0.70% 75.43% Gross carrying amount 39,180 25,728 1,575 66,483 Expected credit loss (79) (181) (1,188) (1,448) Net carrying amount 39,101 25,547 387 65,035 Past due but not impaired     - 25,547 387 25,934 F 248 ----- 12.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) _Financial risk_ The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks that include credit risk, liquidity risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. The Group has a risk management program in place which seeks to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risk. The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board has reviewed the process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively. (i) Credit risk _Exposure to credit risk_ Credit risk arises from credit extended to customers and associates arising on outstanding receivables and outstanding transactions as well as cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks and financial institutions. _Trade and other receivables_ The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. There is no significant concentration of credit risk by dependence on individual customers or geographically. The Group has a large exposure to the financial services industry and the credit risk profile of the Group could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry. The Group has detailed procedures for assessing and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables based on experience, customer’s track record and historic default rates. The Group actively follows up on all overdue debtors. An impairment analysis is performed at each reporting date using a provision matrix to measure expected credit losses, as described in note 1(m) and in note 12 to the financial statements. The aging profile and the details of the provision are given in note 12 to the financial statements. _Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits_ Financial instruments, cash and short-term bank deposits are invested with institutions with the highest credit rating with limits on amounts held with individual banks or institutions at any one time. The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the Group’s maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at year end is the carrying value of the assets. F 251 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (ii) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure as far as possible that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. It is the policy of the Group to have adequate committed undrawn facilities available at all times to cover unanticipated financing requirements. The following are the contractual maturities of the financial liabilities and long term employment benefits, including estimated interest payments excluding the impact of netting agreements: Carrying No set Less than One to five Over five At 31 December 2019: value maturity one year years years _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Accounts payable and other payables 30,394     - 30,394     -     Lease liabilities 27,538      - 8,160 24,441 7 Loans and related interest payable 1,232,263     - 101,961 509,807 1,283,244 1,290,195                 - 140,515 534,248 1,283,251 (iii) Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, and interest rates. It will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of the Group’s risk management strategy is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return earned by the Group. The Group has two types of market risk namely currency risk and interest rate risk each of which are dealt with as follows: Currency risk Foreign exchange risk arises from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. Management requires all Group entities to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency. The Group is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates arising from financing activities, where debt is not in the functional currency of the entity and no hedging arrangements have been put in place. The Group is also exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on the Group’s operating activities when revenue is denominated in a foreign currency and the Group’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Overall the Group seeks to hedge its operating foreign exchange exposure by matching the income and liabilities in each currency. F 252 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iii) Market risk (Continued) Currency risk (Continued) The Group’s material exposures to foreign currency risk for amounts not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant entities at the Statement of Financial Position date were as follows: USD GBP EUR At 31 December 2019 _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Cash and cash equivalents 3,097 1,593 100 Trade and other receivables 4,531 493 496 Debt     -     - (753,803) Gross Statement of Financial Position exposure 7,628 2,086 (753,207) A 5% strengthening or weakening of the exchange rates in respect of the translation of amounts not denominated in the functional currency of relevant entities into the functional currency would impact on the profit or loss over a one year period by the amounts shown below. This assumes that all other variables remain constant. USD GBP EUR Impact on profit before tax: _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000 Impact of 5% strengthening 401 110 (39,642) Impact of 5% weakening -363 -99 35,867 Interest rate risk The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on the external borrowings. At 31 December 2019, the interest on the USD external borrowings was based on USD Libor plus a margin of 7.75% and the interest on EUR external borrowings was based on Euribor plus a margin of 7.75%. The interest rate profile of the borrowings is: Floating Fixed Interest Rate Interest Rate _$’m_ _$’m_ External borrowings: 2019 1,232.3 During the period, the Euribor rate remained at 0% on the Group’s EUR denominated debt. F 253 ----- 15. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK (Continued) (iv) Market risk (Continued) During the period, the USD Libor rate ranged from 2% to 2.3% on the Group’s US Dollar denominated debt. The table below examines the effect that a 50-basis point increase or decrease in Libor would have on profit before tax over a one year period: _$’000_ Increase/(decrease) on profit before tax: Impact of a 50-basis point increase in LIBOR (6.2) Impact of a 50-basis point decrease in LIBOR 6.2 _Fair values and levelling_ For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings are determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings. 16. LEASES The Group leases land and buildings for its office space. The leases of office space typically run for a period between 1 and 10 years. Refer to note 15(ii) for maturity analysis of lease liabilities and to note 11 for roll forward of right-of-use asset. 17. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES Group _2019 $’000 Current:_ Trade creditors 15,834 Accruals 40,800 Deferred income 152,116 Amounts owed to fellow group undertakings 13,432 Loan interest payable 294 Lease liabilities (note 15) 5,843 Other creditors 10,013 238,332 _Non-current:_ Lease liabilities (note 15) 21,695 F 254 ----- F 255 ----- 17. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES (Continued) Trade creditors and amounts due to fellow subsidiary undertakings are stated at amortised cost, which approximates fair value given the short-term nature of these liabilities. Trade and other payables are due within one year, unsecured and interest free. Lease liabilities relate to the recognition, over the lease term, of future lease payments discounted using the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. 18. DIVIDENDS No dividends were paid during the period ended 31 December 2019 and none have been announced as at the date of signing these financial statements. 19.

COMMITMENTS There is a charge over the assets of the Company and over those of certain subsidiary undertakings in favour of Wilmington Trust, National Association, in its role as Collateral Agent. 21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Key management and the directors of the entity, received the following remuneration: _2019 $’000_ Emoluments 1,505 Pension contributions 49 1,554 _Transactions with subsidiaries_ The Group and the Company has availed of the exemption provided in International Accounting Standard 24 “Related Party Disclosures” for wholly owned subsidiary undertakings from the requirements to give details of transactions with entities that are part of the Group or investees of the group qualifying as related parties. The parent undertaking of the largest group of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and of which the Company is a member is ION Investment Group Limited, a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland. Copies of consolidated financial statements are available from the Companies Registration Office, Parnell Square, Dublin 1, Ireland. 22. PENSION COMMITMENTS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. Contributions payable to the funds at the year-end amounted to $0.5 million F 260 ----- 23. PARENT UNDERTAKINGS, CONTROLLING PARTIES, DIRECTORS’ AND SECRETARY’S INTERESTS The Company’s immediate parent undertaking is Acuris Holdings Limited, a company incorporated in England. The Company’s ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party is ITT S.àr.l., a company incorporated in Luxembourg. At the year end, neither the directors, nor the company secretary, their spouses or minor children, held any interests in the shares of the Company, its parent undertaking or any other group undertaking, except as follows: Mr. A. Pignataro owned indirectly 100% of ITT S.àr.l. 24. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS On 11 July 2019, the Group acquired a controlling interest in Mergermarket Topco Limited (“Acuris”) for total consideration of $847.2m. The identifiable net assets have been included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their provisional acquisition date fair value. The initial assignment of fair value to identifiable net assets acquired and the consideration paid has been performed on a provisional basis given the timing of closure of these transactions. Any amendments to these fair values within the twelve month timeframe from the date of acquisition will be disclosable in the 2020 Annual Report as stipulated by IFRS 3. Transaction expenses related to the acquisition were charged in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period. In valuing the net assets of Acuris on acquisition the Group has utilised market standard valuation techniques, specifically: 1. Relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the trademarks and Information Technology being owned. 2. Multi-period excess earnings method, which considers the present value of net cash flows expected to be generated by the customer relationships, by excluding any cash flows related to contributory assets. 3. Replacement Cost, which considers the value of databases owned by estimating the costs that a market participant would incur to replace the asset. 4. Bottom up valuation of deferred income, which considers the value of deferred income to be the cost to fulfil the obligation plus a market participants profit margin. F 261 ----- 24.

In determining these amounts management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of the acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019. F 262 ----- 25. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is causing economic disruptions in most countries. Various measures have been taken by Governments around the world to contain the virus which have had a significant impact on global economic activity. The Group’s products are primarily delivered by electronic means enabling it to continue to service its customers in the current climate. The Group has moved to remote working arrangements which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of staff and to enable the business to operate with minimal impact. A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with customers with the services provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence limited immediate impact is expected on the Group’s revenue stream. Given the nature of the outbreak and the on-going developments, at this time it is not possible to estimate the overall future impact to the Group. 26. REVISIONS TO THE 2019 ANNUAL ACCOUNTS The annual report and financial statements have been revised and will be resubmitted to the UK Companies House and replace the original annual report and financial statements that were approved by the Directors on 21 July 2020. This revised annual report and financial statements are now the statutory financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2019. The revised annual report and financial statements have been prepared as at the date of the original annual report and financial statements and not as at the date of revision and accordingly do not deal with events between those dates. A revision by replacement was deemed necessary after it was identified that the Group had not recognised deferred tax assets. For the financial period ended 31 December 2019, the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets associated with interest on borrowings (pre and post-acquisition of Acuris Group) as restricted by the Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom as management believed that there was not sufficient future taxable income from which the restricted interest and tax losses could be utilised. However, the Group had not considered the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of Acuris Group. In addition, the Group revisited the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As a consequence, Goodwill on acquisition and deferred tax liabilities were overstated and the following amendments to the original annual accounts were made in these revised financial statements: Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income Accounts Original 2019 Revised 2019 Annual Annual Accounts Adjustments Accounts _$’000_ _$’000_ _$’000_ Tax on loss on ordinary activities 6,086 6,437 12,523 Loss for the financial period (62,044) 6,437 (55,607) F 263 ----- Total comprehensive loss (66,395) 6,437 (59,958) 26.

Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. The Group’s investment in an associate is accounted for using the equity method. The condensed consolidated interim statement of comprehensive income reflects the Group’s share in the results of operations of the associates. Where there has been a change recognised in the investees’ other comprehensive income, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in other comprehensive income. Profits and losses arising from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associates. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group. F 10 ----- 1. GENERAL INFORMATION, BASIS OF PREPARATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) _(d)_ _Accounting policies (continued) Investments in associates (continued)_ Upon loss of significant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value.

TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES _30 September_ _31 December 2021_ _2020 $’000_ _$’000_ (Unaudited) Trade creditors 4,346 8,624 Corporation tax 7,533 – Accruals 76,094 64,465 Deferred revenue 188,025 262,122 Amounts owed to fellow subsidiary undertakings 54,890 28,030 Loan interest payable 6,755 728 Other creditors 11,772 19,875 Lease liabilities 5,975 8,332 355,390 392,176 13. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS For all material categories of financial assets and liabilities, the carrying amounts are reasonable approximations of fair values. Management assessed that the fair values of cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, bank overdrafts and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. Management assessed that the fair value of long-term variable-rate borrowings, except for the bonds issued by the Group in May 2021, are determined to approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the floating interest rate repricing to market and there being no change in either the credit or liquidity risk of the external borrowings. The fair value of the bonds issued by the Group amounted to $347.4 million as at September 2021 determined based on the Level 1 input (Quoted market price). 14. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the reporting period, the Group transacted with related parties in the ION Investment Group Limited and subsidiaries (ION Group) in the normal course of business. Please refer to Note 8 and Note 11 for balances outstanding as at 30 September 2021 and 31 December 2019. For the nine months ended 30 September 2021, sales to these group entities amounted to $8.0 million (30 September 2020: $8.2 million) and purchases from these group entities amounted to $20.2 million (30 September 2020: $19.3 million). 15. SEASONALITY Management assessed that the Group’s business is not subject to seasonality, as the Group’s revenue is significantly derived from subscription services which are recognised rateably over the contract period. F 17 ----- 16. OTHER INFORMATION _GOING CONCERN_ The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the 'period of assessment'). The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, business performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multi-year contracts with customers with the services provided being critical to our customer’s operations and these services can be performed remotely by the Group. The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a severe but plausible downside case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities. As a result of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months from the approval of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. _COMMITMENTS_ There is a charge over the assets of the Group and over those of certain subsidiary undertakings in favour of UBS AG, Stamford Branch, in its role as Collateral Agent. 17. EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE In December 2021, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Backstop Solutions Group LLC and subsidiaries, a US based productivity suite provider. The total purchase consideration for the acquisition is $257.0 million. The initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete as at the date of issue of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. F 18 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry; - The Group depends on large transactions from a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenue and the delay or loss of any large customer could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and operating results; - Potential defects in the Group’s products or failure to provide services for the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation; F 21 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

There can be no guarantees that future acquisitions can be successfully assimilated or that projected growth in revenues or synergies in operating costs can be achieved. Additionally, even during a successful integration, the investment of management’s time and resources in the new enterprise may be detrimental to the consolidation and growth of the Group’s existing business; - The Group has funded its activities through the issue of shares operating cash flows and bank borrowings. The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales revenues will fund its existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of financial instruments is discussed in note 15. The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks and uncertainties. The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and proactively limit the associated risks. _SECTION 172 STATEMENT_ The directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members and key stakeholders.

I-logic Technologies Bidco Limited acquired the shares of Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc.; collectively referred to as “Acuris”. The acquisition of the three Acuris companies was a common control transaction which was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange.

Company law requires the directors to prepare Group and Company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law, the directors have elected to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and applicable law, and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’ (FRS 101). Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of their profit or loss for that year.

We did not identify any additional fraud risks. We performed procedures including: - Identifying journal entries and other adjustments to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included testing journals that were debits to revenue or credit to revenue with unexpected debit entries. _Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations_ We identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations. We communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. The potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably. Firstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation and taxation legislation, and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items. Secondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: GDPR compliance, anti-bribery, and employment law recognising the cross-geographical nature of the Group’s activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach. _Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation_ Owing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Group generates revenue from data and product licenses and from professional services. The Group has adopted IFRS 16, the new leases standard using the modified retrospective approach with an initial application date of 1 January 2019. The resulting impact on transition is disclosed in note 1(s). The Company was incorporated on 14 November 2017. The Group will continue to sell and develop market content and software solutions. On 12 September 2019, the Group acquired 100% of Selerity Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Selerity”), a technology provider specialised in artificial intelligence solutions for unstructured data and content. _Financial Performance Indicators_ The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation) and Profit on Ordinary Activities after Taxation. _Revenue_ The Group’s total revenue was $184.6 million in 2019 (2018: $169.8 million). The increase in total revenue for 2019 as compared to 2018 of $14.8 million. _EBITDA_ Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation was $96.4 million in 2019 (2018: $69.3 million). _Loss on Ordinary Activities after Taxation_ Loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2019 was$3.9 million (2018: loss of $43.8 million), after a $66.0 million charge related to the amortisation of intangible assets (2018: $67.4 million). _PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_ The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are: - The Group currently derives most of its revenue from a limited number of products. As a result, a reduction in demand for, or sales of, these products would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and operating results; - The Group derives all of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry; - The Group depends on large transactions from a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenue and the delay or loss of any large customer could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and operating results; - Potential defects in the Group’s products or failure to provide services for the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation; - The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could obtain and use the Group’s technology without authorisation; F 65 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,1793,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED COMPANY INFORMATION,1793.20,I-LOGIC** **TECHNOLOGIES** **BIDCO** **LIMITED DIRECTORS’ REPORT for the year ended 31 December 2019,1793.20.1,,"The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2019. _DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_ The names of the directors who served at any time during the financial year are as listed on page F-50. The interests of the directors and company secretary in shares of the company or other group companies are set out in note 23 to the financial statements. _DIVIDENDS_ In 2019, a dividend of $6.2 million was declared and paid (2018: $Nil). _RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_ The Group has invested in the development of new and existing products with considerable effort applied by the technical and software development teams. As set out in note 1(f), when certain criteria are met the costs are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the useful life of the asset, currently considered to be 3 years. These capitalised development costs are shown in note 9. All other development costs are expensed as incurred. _GOING CONCERN_ Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, including the expected impact of COVID-19, and its current financial position, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue to manage its business risks successfully and to remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the report and accounts. _FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS_ The Group’s financial risk management objective is to identify financial risks and implement suitable risk reducing measures where appropriate. In implementing this objective, Group policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash amounts are held to meet all working capital requirements and sufficient committed borrowing facilities are available to meet longer term requirements. The Group is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. For information on these risks please refer to note 15. _EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_ In March and April 2020, the Group repurchased and extinguished $16.8 million nominal value of the Group’s debt. Subsequent to the year end, the COVID-19 outbreak developed rapidly, which is causing economic disruptions in most countries. Various measures have been taken by Governments around the world to contain the virus which have had a significant impact on global economic activity. The Group’s principle activity is to develop and market data and software solutions, and as such a significant proportion of our projects can be performed remotely. The Group has moved to remote working arrangements which are running smoothly, to ensure the safety of our staff and to enable our business to operate with minimal impact. A significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from multiyear contracts with customers with the services provided being critical to our customers’ operations, hence limited immediate impact is expected on the Group’s revenue stream. Having considered reasonably expected sensitivities from COVID-19, the directors believe it is still appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.

The Group generates revenue from product licenses and from professional services. The Company was incorporated on 14 November 2017. The Group will continue to sell and develop market content and software solutions. On 21 December 2017, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Diamond Topco Limited and its trading subsidiaries, including the Dealogic group of companies. _Financial Performance Indicators_ The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation) and Profit on Ordinary Activities after Taxation. _Revenue_ The Group’s total revenue was $169.8 million in 2018 and $3.6 million for the period ended 31 December 2017. The increase in total revenue for 2017 as compared to 2018 of $166.2 million is a result of a full years activity being included for 2018. _EBITDA_ Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation was $69.3 million in 2018 and a loss of $6.9 million in the period ended 31 December 2017. The loss in 2017 year was caused by costs associated with the acquisition of Dealogic in December 2017. _Loss on Ordinary Activities after Taxation_ Loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2018 was $43.8 million (2017: profit of $12.5 million), after a $67.4 million charge related to the amortisation of intangible assets (2017: $1.8 million). _PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_ The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are: - The Group currently derives most of its revenue from a limited number of products. As a result, a reduction in demand for, or sales of, these products would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and operating results; - The Group derives all of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry; - The Group depends on large transactions from a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenue and the delay or loss of any large customer could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and operating results; - Potential defects in the Group’s products or failure to provide services for the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation; F 106 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales revenues will fund its existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all.

These revised annual accounts replace the original annual accounts of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 which were approved on 11 April 2021 and should now represent the statutory accounts of the Company for that financial year. The revised strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared as at the date of the original annual accounts and not as at the date of the revision hence any events in between those dates have not been dealt with in the revised strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements. The original strategic report, original directors’ report and original consolidated financial statements did not comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with interest on borrowings as restricted by the Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom as management believed that there wasn’t sufficient future taxable income from which the restricted interest and tax losses could be utilised. However, management had not considered the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of Mergermarket Topco Limited and subsidiaries (“Acuris Group”) in 2019. In addition, the Group revisited the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As a result, amendments to the original annual accounts have been made. Refer to Note 26 to the financial statements for disclosure of the amendments to the revised annual accounts. This revised 2020 annual accounts were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 20 January 2022.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,325,COMPANY INFORMATION,325.2,STRATEGIC REPORT for the financial year ended 31 December 2020 (continued),325.2.1,,"The directors present herewith their Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and audited consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2020. _PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES, REVIEW OF THE BUSINESS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS_ Acuris International Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (the “Group”) provide financial information services, analysis and data to the advisory, corporate and financial communities. The Group primarily generates revenue from subscription services and expects to continue to provide these services in the future. The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited, the holding company of the Acuris group on 11 July 2019. _Financial Performance Indicators_ The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation), Profit after Taxation, Net Cashflow and Net Debt. _Revenue_ The Group’s total revenue was $277.2 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 and $136.2 million for the period ended 31 December 2019. The increase in total revenue for 2020 as compared to the period ended 2019 is $141.0 million or 103.6%. _EBITDA_ Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation were $10.7 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 and $32.2 million for the period ended 31 December 2019. The decrease in EBITDA for 2020 as compared to 2019 is $21.5 million or 66.7%. _Loss after Taxation_ Loss after taxation, including a $95.4 million charge relating to the amortisation of intangible assets ($39.7 million for the period ended 31 December 2019), was $174.8 million for the year ended 31 December 2020 compared to a loss after taxation of $55.6 million for the period ended 31 December 2019. The increase in loss after taxation for 2020 as compared to 2019 is $119.2 million or 214.4%. _Net Cashflow and Net Debt_ The Group’s cash balance decreased by $2.6 million in 2020 compared to an increase of $14.2m in the period ended 31 December 2019. Net debt at the end of 2020 was $1,261.5 million compared to $1,181.3 million at the end of 2019. The increase in the net debt is primarily due to foreign exchange loss on the EUR loan facilities. See the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for further details on the movements in cash. _PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_ The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are: � The Group derives the majority of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry as well as consolidation amongst the Group’s customers. � Failure to provide services to the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation; � The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could obtain and use the Group’s technology without authorisation; F - 144 ----- _PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES (continued)_ � The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others; � The Group has funded its activities through the issue of shares, operating cash flows and bank borrowings. The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales revenues will fund its existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of financial instruments is discussed in note 15. The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks and uncertainties. The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and proactively limit the associated risks. _SECTION 172 STATEMENT_ The directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members and key stakeholders. The directors when making key decisions for the Company have had considered the impact of their decisions to the Company’s key stakeholders and to wider society by continuing to facilitate the critical processes within our customer’s businesses, and by focusing on innovation in the capital markets in order to contribute to continuous process improvement for our customers. One of Acuris’ core values is to long term thinking and building long-term sustainable relationships with our customers. Acuris’s products help our customers to improve decisionmaking, increase efficiency, simplify complex processes and empower their people. This is achieved by partnering with our customers to enable them to find insights that lead to business opportunities as well as strengthen compliance and risk management with in depth regulatory insights. These long-term sustainable relationships allow us to invest in product development that enhances our products and provides more useful information to our customers; as well as managing our commitments to our suppliers and lenders. The Company recognises our employees are a critical success factor for the Company, hence we seek to assist our employees to succeed through a positive culture and continuous improvement. There are a number of measures in place to keep employees up to date on recent developments of company and allow employee engagement with senior management, through face to face meetings and electronic media.

153_1,Preliminary Offerings 2022.md,325,COMPANY INFORMATION,325.4,DIRECTORS’ REPORT for the financial year ended 31 December 2020,325.4.1,,"The directors present herewith their report and the audited consolidated financial statements (“financial statements” or “consolidated financial statements”) for the year ended 31 December 2020. _DIRECTORS AND THEIR INTERESTS_ The interests of the directors and company secretary who served at any time during the financial year in shares of the Company or other Group companies are set out in note 23 to the financial statements. On 21 July 2020, Kunal Gullapalli was appointed as a director of the Company. _DIVIDENDS_ The Board of Directors did not recommend payment of dividends during the year. _EVENTS SINCE THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE_ On 16 February 2021, there was a group reorganisation and refinancing of debt facilities. The Company sold its holdings in Acuris Bidco Limited, Acuris Finance S.à r.l. and Acuris Finance US, Inc to I-logic Technologies Bidco Limited. The sale was a common control transaction which was undertaken by way of a share for share exchange. Concurrent with the group reorganisation, the newly combined group refinanced the existing debt facilities by drawing down a new debt facility to repay its existing debt facilities. The new debt extends the maturity of both the USD and Euro facilities to 16 February 2028. _RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_ Research and development is concentrated on the development of technology to enable subscribers to access its products. The capitalised development costs are shown in note 9. All other development costs are expensed as incurred. _GOING CONCERN_ The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis of accounting. The time period that the directors have considered in evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting is a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the 'period of assessment'). The directors have considered the Group’s business activities and how it generates value, together with the main trends and factors likely to affect future development, business performance and position of the Group; including the continued impact of the COVID-19 outbreak that spread rapidly in 2020. COVID-19 has a limited impact on the Group’s operations, since a significant portion of the Group’s revenue is derived from recurring revenues that are billed upfront for services that are critical to our customer’s operations and these services can be performed remotely by the Group. The directors have considered the budget of the Group, both a base case and a downside case, and also examined the financial position of the Group, including cash flows, liquidity position, and borrowing facilities (see note 15 for details on the loans and note 25 for details on the post year end refinancing). As a result of this review, the directors have satisfied themselves and consider it appropriate that the Group and the Company is a going concern, having adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have not identified any material uncertainties that would cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern over a period of at least 12 months.

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following: � We confirmed, through management enquiry, our understanding of management’s Going Concern assessment process. We also engaged with management early to ensure all key risks and factors were considered in their assessment. � We obtained management’s going concern assessment which assesses current economic factors, current profitability and the projected cashflows of the group. Management’s assessment includes forecasts and sensitivity analysis, covering a period up to June 2022.We tested the assumptions included in the cash forecasts. We considered the appropriateness of the methods used to calculate the cash forecast and determined through inspection and testing of the methodology and calculations that the methods utilised were appropriate to be able to make an assessment for the group. � We performed reverse stress testing on the forecasts to understand how severe the downside scenarios would have to be to result in the elimination of liquidity headroom or a covenant breach. � We reviewed managements’ covenant calculations and performed a detailed review of all the borrowing facilities to assess their continued availability to the Group and company through the going concern period and to ensure completeness of covenants. � We read the Group and Company’s going concern disclosures included in the financial statements in order to assess whether the disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the period to June 2022. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.  However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. Our approach was as follows: � We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and parent company and determined that the most significant are International Accounting Standards, FRS 101, Companies Act 2006 and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the UK. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and those laws and regulations relating to health and safety, employee matters, environmental and bribery and corruption practices; � We understood how Acuris International Limited is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management. We corroborated our enquires through reading the board minutes, and we noted that there was no contradictory evidence; � We assessed the susceptibility of the group and parent company’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by inquiry of management, those charged with governance and others within the group and entity, as to whether they have knowledge of any actual or suspected fraud. Where this risk was considered higher, we performed audit procedures to address the fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. � Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved reading board minutes to identify any non-compliance with laws and regulations and enquiries of management.

These revised annual accounts replace the original annual accounts of the Company for the financial period ended 31 December 2019 which were approved on 21 July 2020 and should now represent the statutory accounts of the Company for that financial period. The revised strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared as at the date of the original annual accounts and not as at the date of the revision hence any events in between those dates have not been dealt with in the revised strategic report, revised directors’ report and revised audited consolidated financial statements. The original strategic report, original directors’ report and original consolidated financial statements did not comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 in relation to the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with interest on borrowings as restricted by the Corporate Interest Restriction (CIR) rules and tax losses carried forward in the United Kingdom as management believed that there wasn’t sufficient future taxable income from which the restricted interest and operating losses could be utilised. However, management had not considered the deferred tax liability associated with the fair value adjustments on acquisition of Mergermarket Topco Limited and subsidiaries (“Acuris Group”). In addition, the Group revisited the offsetting of its outstanding deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities. As a result, amendments to the original annual accounts have been made. Refer to Note 26 to the financial statements for disclosure of the amendments to the revised annual accounts.

The Group primarily generates revenue from subscription services and expects to continue to provide these services in the future. The Company was incorporated on 18 April 2019 and acquired Mergermarket Topco Limited, the holding company of the Acuris group on 11 July 2019. _Financial Performance Indicators_ The Group’s key measures of financial performance are Revenue, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation) and Profit on Ordinary Activities after Taxation. _Revenue_ The Group’s total revenue was $136.2 million for the period. _EBITDA_ Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation was $32.2 million in the period. _Loss on Ordinary Activities after Taxation_ Loss on ordinary activities after taxation for the period ended 31 December 2019 was $55.6 million. _PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES_ The principal risks and uncertainties which the Group faces are: � The Group derives the majority of its revenues from customers in the financial services industry. The Group’s business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by significant changes in that industry as well as consolidation amongst the Group’s customers. � Failure to provide services to the Group’s customers could cause the Group’s revenue to decrease, cause the Group to lose customers and damage the Group’s reputation; � The Group has a limited ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and others could obtain and use the Group’s technology without authorisation; � The Group may be exposed to significant liability if it infringes the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others; F - 209 -----",N/A,as_expected,2022,641

The Group expects that the proceeds of bank borrowings, current working capital and sales revenues will fund its existing operations and payment obligations. However, if the Group’s capital requirements are greater than expected, or if revenues are not sufficient to fund operations, the Group may need to find additional financing which may not be available on attractive terms or at all. The Group’s use of financial instruments is discussed in note 15. The Group has insurances, business policies and organisational structures to limit these risks and uncertainties. The Board of Directors and management regularly review, reassess and proactively limit the associated risks. _SECTION 172 STATEMENT_ The Directors are aware of their duty under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006 to act in the way which they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members and key stakeholders. The directors when making key decisions for the Company have had considered the impact of their decisions to the Company’s key stakeholders and to wider society by continuing to facilitate the critical processes within our clients’ businesses, and by focusing on innovation in the capital markets in order to contribute to continuous process improvement for our clients.

The interests of the directors and company secretary in shares of the company or other group companies are set out in note 23 to the financial statements. _DIVIDENDS_ No dividends were declared in the year. _RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT_ The Group has invested in the development of new and existing products with considerable effort applied by the technical and software development teams.

These capitalised development costs are shown in note 9. All other development costs are expensed as incurred. _GOING CONCERN_ Having reviewed the future plans and projections for the business, including the expected impact of COVID-19, and its current financial position, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate financial resources to continue to manage its business risks successfully and to remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
