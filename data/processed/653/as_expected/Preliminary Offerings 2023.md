amended (“UK MiFIR”).

Prospective purchasers that are QIBs are hereby notified that the seller of the securities will be relying on the exemption from the provisions
of Section 5 of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Rule 144A.

You are reminded that the offering memorandum has been delivered to you on the basis that you are a person into whose possession the
offering memorandum may be lawfully delivered in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are located and you may
not, nor are you authorized to, deliver the offering memorandum to any other person.

The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where
offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
initial purchasers or any affiliate of the initial purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the offering shall be deemed to be
made by the initial purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuer in such jurisdiction. Under no circumstances shall the offering
memorandum constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, these securities in any jurisdiction
in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

The offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments and
who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial
Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net
worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are
persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”)) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be
communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The offering
memorandum is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any
investment or investment activity to which the offering memorandum relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in
only with relevant persons.

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the
meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the securities other than in circumstances in
which Section 21(1) of FSMA does not apply to us.

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be
altered or changed during the process of electronic transmission and consequently none of the initial purchasers, any person who controls the
initial purchasers, the Issuer, the Guarantors (each term, as defined in the attached offering memorandum), any of their respective directors,
officers, employees or agents or affiliates of the foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of
any difference between the offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy version available to you on request
from the initial purchasers.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The securities described herein are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made**
available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, “a retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution
Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II.
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering
or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or
selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.
The offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant
to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a
prospectus for offers of Notes. The offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**EEA professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any initial**
purchaser that considers itself as manufacturer pursuant to MiFID II, the target market assessment in respect of the securities described in
the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such securities is persons satisfying the criteria of the
definition of “eligible counterparties” or “professional clients” only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of
such securities to such persons are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such securities (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The securities described herein are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available**
to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a “retail
investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, and as amended; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA and as amended (“UK MiFIR”). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms
part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the securities or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities
or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The
offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an


-----

exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of securities. The
offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

**UK professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any initial**
purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR
**Product Governance Rules”), the target market assessment in respect of the securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target**
market for the securities is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules, and professional clients,
as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the
manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONFIDENTIAL

**Olympus Water US Holding Corporation**
**$2,125,000,000 Senior Secured Notes due 2028, consisting of**
**$1,625,000,000        % Senior Secured Notes due 2028**
**€(the euro equivalent of $500,000,000)            % Senior Secured Notes due 2028**

**The Issuer**

- Issuer: If we close this offering concurrently with the Acquisition (as defined herein), Olympus Water US Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (the “Ultimate Issuer”), will issue the Notes (as defined herein) offered hereby. If we close this offering prior to the Acquisition,
Diamond Escrow Issuer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Escrow Issuer”), will issue the Notes and, substantially
concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, merge (the “Escrow Merger”) with and into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate
Issuer continuing as the surviving entity and assuming the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (as defined
herein). As used herein, “Issuer” refers, prior to the Escrow Merger, to the Escrow Issuer and, immediately after the Escrow Merger (or on
the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with this offering), to the Ultimate Issuer. The Ultimate Issuer is a holding company of
the group of companies doing business as Solenis (as defined herein) and is controlled by affiliates of funds advised by Platinum Equity
Advisors, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Platinum” or the “Sponsor”).

**The Offering:**

- The Issuer is offering $     aggregate principal amount of     % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Notes”) and €
aggregate principal amount of    % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes”).
The Notes are being issued in connection with the pending acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of Diversey Holdings, Ltd., a Cayman Islands
exempted company (“Diversey”), and its subsidiaries by Parent (as defined herein). The Acquisition will be effected through a merger,
pursuant to which Diamond Merger Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”),
will merge with and into Diversey, with Diversey continuing as the surviving entity, following which Diversey will be a direct whollyowned subsidiary of Parent. See “The Transactions.”

- Unless otherwise indicated, references in this offering memorandum to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “its” refer to Olympus Water Holdings IV,
L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership, acting through its general partner, General Partner (as defined herein) (“Parent”), the
direct parent of the Ultimate Issuer, and its consolidated subsidiaries immediately following the Acquisition.

- Use of Proceeds: The Issuer intends for the proceeds from this offering, together with the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility (as
defined herein), the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment (as defined herein) and the New Equity Contribution (as defined herein), to
be used as part of the financing for the Acquisition, to fund the Refinancing (as defined herein) and to pay fees, commissions and expenses
related to the Transactions (as defined herein). See “Use of Proceeds.”

**Escrow:**

- This offering may close prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If we close this offering prior to the Acquisition,
the Escrow Issuer will, pending completion of the Acquisition, fund the gross proceeds of the offering into separate escrow accounts, as
more particularly described herein. The Escrow Issuer will not be subject to the restrictive covenants under the various debt instruments
governing our Existing Indebtedness or the Existing Diversey Indebtedness (each as defined herein).

- If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds from the sale of the Notes into separate escrow accounts for the benefit of the Trustee (as defined herein) and the holders of the
applicable series of Notes. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to certain conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement (as
defined herein), including the consummation of the Acquisition. In the event that (i) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the
Outside Date (as defined herein), (ii) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined herein) are deemed,
in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (iii) at any time prior to the
Outside Date, the Acquisition Agreement (as defined herein) is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the
Acquisition, each series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the issue date of the Notes (the “Issue Date”) to, but excluding, the date of such
special mandatory redemption. The Ultimate Issuer, or one of its affiliates, will agree, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent (as
defined herein) and the holders of each series of Notes, (i) in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring
prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, to transfer an amount of cash to the Escrow Issuer that is sufficient to fund the
accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders of the Notes and (ii) upon receipt of a notice of a special mandatory redemption of the
Notes from the Escrow Issuer, to transfer an amount of cash to the Escrow Issuer that will be sufficient, after taking into account the
escrowed funds at such time, to fund the redemption of all of the Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the fees and
expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. If this offering closes concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
not be subject to the escrow provisions described in this offering memorandum. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

**The Notes:**

- Maturity: The Notes will mature on November 15, 2028.

- Interest Payments: Each series of Notes will pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning
on October 1, 2023.

- Guarantees: Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will not be guaranteed. From and after satisfaction of the Escrow
Release Conditions and immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes
concurrently with this offering), subject to certain exceptions, the Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent and each of
Parent’s existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that are guarantors under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (as
defined herein) (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with Parent, the “Guarantors”). To the extent lenders under the Term Loan Credit
Agreement release any Guarantor from its obligations, subject to certain exceptions, such Guarantor will also be released from its
obligations under the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.”

- Security and Ranking: If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will initially be obligations solely of
the Escrow Issuer, secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and all deposits and investments therein.
From and after satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions and immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition (or on the
Issue Date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with this offering), the Notes and the related guarantees will be general, senior secured
obligations of the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors, secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Fixed Asset Collateral (as
defined herein) and on a second-priority basis in the Current Asset Collateral (as defined herein), in each case, subject to certain limitations
and permitted liens. The Notes and the related guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Ultimate Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ subordinated indebtedness and be effectively senior to all of the Ultimate Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ unsecured indebtedness,
including the Existing Unsecured Notes (as defined herein), and indebtedness secured by liens junior to the liens securing the Notes,
including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility (as defined herein), in each case, to the extent of the
value of the assets securing the Notes. The Notes and the related guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Ultimate
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ senior indebtedness, without giving effect to collateral arrangements, and equal to all of the Ultimate Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ senior indebtedness secured on the same priority basis as the Notes, including the Existing Secured Notes (as defined
herein) and the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the Ultimate
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute collateral for the Notes to the extent of the value of
such assets, and indebtedness that is secured by a senior-priority lien, including our ABL Revolving Credit Facility to the extent of the value
of the Current Asset Collateral, and will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Parent’s subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary
Guarantors.

- Optional Redemption: Each series of Notes may be redeemed on or after June 1, 2025 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to June 1, 2025, each series
of Notes may be redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium. At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer
may also redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes with an amount equal to the proceeds of certain equity
offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date. At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of
Notes during each calendar year at a purchase price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

- Change of Control: If we undergo a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer is required to offer to purchase each series of
Notes from holders at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase. In connection with any offer to purchase any series of Notes, if holders of no less
than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes validly tender their Notes, the Issuer is entitled to redeem any remaining
Notes of such series at the price offered to each holder.

- Redemption for Taxation Reasons: In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less
than all, of the relevant series of Notes. See “Description of Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

- Each series of Notes is a new issue of securities and there is currently no established trading market for any series of Notes. This offering
memorandum includes additional information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer
restrictions. See “Description of Notes.”

- The Notes will trade separately from the Existing Notes (as defined herein), will have a different ISIN and CUSIP than the Existing Notes
and will not be fungible with the Existing Notes.

**Investing in the Notes involves risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 58.**

**Offering Price of the Dollar Notes:     % plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2023.**
**Offering Price of the Euro Notes:     % plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2023.**

The Notes and the guarantees thereof have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“Securities Act”), or any other securities law. The Issuer is not required to and does not intend to register the Notes for resale under the Securities
Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdictions, and the Issuer is not required to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons,
except to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A
under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the


-----

Securities Act. The Issuer and the initial purchasers named below are offering the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified
institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S
under the Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

There is currently no public market for the Notes. The Dollar Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated
quotation system. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”)
following the consummation of this offering. The listing application will be subject to the approval by The International Stock Exchange
Authority Limited (the “Authority”). The Exchange is not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU. There is no assurance
that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the
listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an
application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

The Issuer expects that the Dollar Notes will be ready for delivery in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company
(“DTC”) and the Euro Notes will be ready for delivery in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream
Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), in each case, on or about       , 2023, which is the     business day following the date of confirmation of
orders with respect to the Notes and the date of this offering memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). See “Plan of
Distribution.”

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for
offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering
memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any
of the Notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or
permission required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the
jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial
purchasers will have any responsibility therefor.

By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties
and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial
purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted.
You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite
period of time.

This offering memorandum summarizes documents and other information in a manner we believe to be
accurate, but we refer you to the actual documents for a more complete understanding of the information we discuss
in this offering memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of such
documents, our business and the terms of the offering and the Notes, including the merits and risks involved.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information set forth in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this offering
memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future.

The initial purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and no one else in connection with the offering
contemplated by this offering memorandum. They will not regard any other person (whether or not a recipient of
this offering memorandum) as their client in relation to the offering of securities contemplated by this offering
memorandum and will not be responsible to anyone for providing the protections afforded to a client nor for giving
advice in relation to the offering or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein.

This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to persons reasonably believed to
be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act for informational use solely in
connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) in offshore transactions outside the United
States complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Its use for any other purpose
is not authorized. This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only
be distributed and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided by us or by the initial purchasers.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive
(EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful. This offering
memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made
pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each initial purchaser that considers itself a
manufacturer pursuant to MiFID II, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this offering
memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and
professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to such
persons are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”)
should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID
II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or
refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”), and as amended; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the
UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under
the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA and as amended (“UK MiFIR”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU)
1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (the “UK PRIIPs
Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis
that any offer of Notes in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU)
2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (the “UK Prospectus
Regulation”) and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering
memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each initial purchaser that considers itself a
manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK
MiFIR Product Governance Rules”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion
that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of
Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the
Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling
or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market
assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the
manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The above selling restrictions are in addition to any other selling restrictions set out in this offering
memorandum.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the
accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on
the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the
accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that
is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to
make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering memorandum, other
than as contained in this offering memorandum, and in information given by our duly authorized officers and
employees in connection with an investor’s examination of us and the terms of the offering of the Notes.

We and the initial purchasers make no representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you.
You should not consider any information included in this offering memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice.
You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding
an investment in the Notes. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor any sale made pursuant to this
offering memorandum implies that any information set forth in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date
after the date of this offering memorandum.

iii


-----

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason, to sell less than the
entire principal amount of the Notes offered in this offering memorandum and to allot to any prospective investor
less than the full amount of Notes sought by such investor. We are making this offering of the Notes subject to the
terms described in this offering memorandum and the Indenture, as applicable.

Each series of Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that each series of Notes sold
pursuant to this offering memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates. The global
certificates will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of, with respect to the Euro Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream and, with respect to the
Dollar Notes, DTC. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global
certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and its direct and
indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Notes in certificated form will be issued in
exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

We do not intend to apply for listing of the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the
Notes in any automated dealer quotation system. We intend to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange after the
issue date of the Euro Notes. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange
will be approved and settlement of the Euro Notes is not conditioned on the Issuer making an application or
obtaining such listing or admission to trading. Neither the admission of the Euro Notes to be listed on the Exchange,
nor the approval of this offering memorandum pursuant to the listing requirements of the Authority shall constitute a
warranty or representation by the Authority as to the competence of the service providers to, or any other party
connected with, the Issuer, the adequacy of information contained in this offering memorandum or the suitability of
the Issuer for investment or any other purposes.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that
stabilize or maintain the market price of each series of Notes at a higher level than such series of Notes might
otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a
description of these activities, see the section entitled “Plan of Distribution” in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum is strictly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection
with the proposed offering of the Notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is
personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for
or otherwise acquire the Notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and
those persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect to this offering memorandum is unauthorized and
any disclosure of any of its contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this
offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this
offering memorandum or any documents delivered in connection with this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents related to this offering, will not be reviewed or
approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Notes and related guarantees
described in this offering memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the SEC or
any other federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such
federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this
offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. There are no registration rights
associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer Notes registered under the Securities Act in exchange
for the Notes offered in this offering or to file a registration statement with respect to the Notes. The Indenture will
not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).

forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the development of the
industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering
memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this offering memorandum speak only as of the date of
those statements, and we undertake no obligation to update those statements or to publicly announce the results of
any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current
and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless
expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following
non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma
Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing
cash flows. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our
financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our
operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our
core business. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our
performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Segment profit as the primary measure of our segment
specific performance. The following terms have the following meanings:

    - “Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to (i) for Solenis, the impact of
non-recurring charges, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments related to the Legacy Acquisitions
and the Sigura Contribution, non-service costs for pensions and other non-operational items, one-time
consulting and transaction costs related to the Acquisition, management fees paid to Sponsor, realized
and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, as well as other non-recurring and unusual costs and, (ii)
for Diversey, the impact of non-recurring charges, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, nonservice costs for pensions and other non-operational items, one-time consulting and transaction costs
related to the Acquisition, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, tax adjustments not
related to income tax, factoring and securitization fees, COVID-19 inventory charges, as well as other
non-recurring and unusual costs.

    - “Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega)” means
Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to, with respect to Solenis the impact of incentive
compensation at 1.0x of the applicable targets, the pre-close EBITDA of Clearon and the unaudited pro
forma impact for certain estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions (i) that were taken
within 18 months of the closing of the Solenis Acquisition and (ii) that were taken or are expected to
be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Clearon Acquisition and, with respect to Diversey,
expected savings from Project Mega.

    - “Adjusted net operating cash flows” and “Adjusted net investing cash flows” means, for Solenis,
reported net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and net cash provided by (used in)
investing activities, each adjusted for the effects of cash subsequently received as part of our Accounts
Receivable Facility (as defined herein).

    - “EBITDA” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and
amortization (including amortization of pre-publication investment cash costs).

    - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to
the Transactions.

    - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and
_Project Mega)” means Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and_
Project Mega) further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions.

    - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies)” means Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the unaudited pro forma
combined impact for certain estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions expected to be taken
within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Acquisition and the Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits
from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted

vii


-----

EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies
and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related
Synergies).”

    - “Pro Forma Combined EBITDA” means EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions.

    - “Segment profit” means, for Solenis, EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii)
the impact of certain non-cash, non-recurring or other items that are included in net (loss) and
EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and (iii) certain
unusual or non-recurring items impacting results in a particular period.

We believe the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related
Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating
cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our
performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions,
Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related
Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows may vary from
that of other competitors in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to income
before income taxes, net (loss), or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as
measures of operating performance and liquidity. See “Summary—Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations of Parent—Non-GAAP Financial Metrics—Reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA and
Segment Profit.”

With respect to Adjusted net operating cash flows and Adjusted net investing cash flows, Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-15 requires us to evaluate the transfer of title of receivables sold under our
Accounts Receivable Facility against cash received on previously-sold receivables in exchange for the transfer of
title. Since there is a dichotomy between when we legally transfer title of receivables to ING Luxembourg S.A. or,
in prior periods, MUFG Bank, Ltd. under the receivables purchasing agreements and when the cash is received on
previously-sold receivables, receivables are deemed transferred in exchange for a beneficial interest in the collection
of that receivable. This is considered a non-cash investing activity. Furthermore, ultimate receipts of cash, when
settled with ING Luxembourg S.A. or, in prior periods, MUFG Bank, Ltd., are considered cash flows from investing
activities, as the receipt is considered a return of capital on the beneficial interest.

We believe that this may cause net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and net cash provided by
(used in) investing activities to be potentially misleading to investors. While we do not retain legal ownership of the
receivables sold, the nature, timing, and extent of cash flows have not materially changed as a result of the
agreement. We use these non-GAAP metrics to assess our own liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP metrics
supplement the user’s evaluation of our cash flows and liquidity.

The adjustments reflected in our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA,
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) have not been prepared with
a view towards complying with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies) are intended to provide additional information on a more comparable basis than
would be if provided without such adjustments because they account for initiatives related to back office, sales and
support staff optimization, warehouse and temporary labor efficiency and technology, among others.

The non-GAAP measures noted above are the primary indicators that we use internally to conduct and
measure our business and evaluate the performance of our consolidated operations. We believe these non-GAAP
financial measures are useful because they provide meaningful comparisons to prior periods. These non-GAAP
financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with

viii


-----

GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that,
when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial
measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. A material limitation
associated with these non-GAAP measures as compared to the GAAP measures is that they may not be comparable
to other companies with similarly titled measures that present related measures differently. The non-GAAP
measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the corresponding
measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The Indenture governing the Notes, the Existing Indentures and the Credit Agreements include definitions
of EBITDA-based metrics that are different from the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA
(After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related
Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related
Synergies) used herein. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related
Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) should be considered in addition to, not
as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are
encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In
evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and
Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), you should be aware that in the future we may
incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy
Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected
by unusual or non-recurring items.

The non-GAAP metrics do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to
meet our cash requirements and may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor are such measures
meant to be predictive of our future results. Our non-GAAP metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you
should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are:

    - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

    - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service
interest or principal payments on our debts;

    - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) do not reflect any cash requirements that
would be required for such replacements;

    - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted

ix


-----

EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) reflect cash payments that were made, or will
be made in the future; and

    - other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy
Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, or
Adjusted net investing cash flows differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative
measures.

We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and
Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment
profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows along with other comparative tools,
together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance and liquidity. Such
U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, and net (loss) amongst other performance metrics.
In evaluating these financial measures, one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to
those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of such measures should not be construed as an inference that
our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted herein to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions,
Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related
Synergies). However, the magnitude of such adjustments for the periods noted below is not necessarily indicative of
the magnitude of such adjustments in future periods.

See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data” for a reconciliation of these
measures to our directly comparable GAAP measures.

Because the leverage ratios presented in this offering memorandum are based, in part, on Adjusted
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma
Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies), these measures are similarly impacted by the limitations referenced above and
also should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.

**BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

The consolidated financial statements of Parent (“Successor”) and Solenis (“Predecessor”) as of and for
each of the years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 and as of and for the
three and six months ended March 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2022, and the periods November
9, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and October 1, 2021 to November 8, 2021 have been prepared in accordance U.S.
GAAP, and include the financial statements of Parent and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

The consolidated and combined financial statements of Diversey Holdings, Ltd. as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and
March 31, 2022 have also been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and include the financial statements of
Diversey Holdings, Ltd and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Parent was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the “Successor” entity for the specific purpose of having
consummated the Solenis Acquisition. Parent also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of having
received the contribution of the Sigura business, which was acquired by Platinum on February 28, 2019 and was
contributed to Parent (the “Sigura Contribution”) immediately following the Solenis Acquisition on November 9,
2021.

Parent was formed under a group of holding companies. These holding companies and partnerships are
collectively referred to as the “Holding Companies.” The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets
other than cash, cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and
Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above.

Upon the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition, Platinum acquired all of the capital stock and equity
interests of the entities comprising the legacy Solenis operations from Solenis UK Holdings Limited.

Immediately following the Solenis Acquisition, the Sigura Contribution was effected, which included all of
Sigura’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, and which contributed the Sigura business to the Issuer from affiliates of
Platinum. Accordingly, the conclusion of the Solenis Acquisition and Sigura Contribution resulted in the
consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses (under the Solenis umbrella) from
November 9, 2021 within the financial statements contained in this offering memorandum as presented under the
“Successor” periods.

Prior to the formation of Parent and the occurrence of the Solenis Acquisition, the Solenis business existed
under the “Predecessor” entity known as Solenis UK International.

Solenis UK International itself was not acquired as part of the Solenis Acquisition. Instead, the Solenis
Acquisition was structured to acquire all of the entities that were direct or indirect subsidiaries of Solenis UK
International.

The consolidated statement of operations of Parent for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022,
September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2022 and
September 30, 2021 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of
Parent for the year ended September 30, 2022, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Due to the impact
of the Solenis Acquisition by Parent on November 9, 2021, the audited consolidated financial information of Parent
for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is presented in two distinct periods to indicate the application of a
different basis of accounting between the periods presented: (1) for periods prior to the Solenis Acquisition (October
1, 2021 through November 8, 2021, labeled Predecessor) and (2) for periods after the Solenis Acquisition
(November 9, 2021 through September 30, 2022, labeled Successor).

This offering memorandum also includes the unaudited interim consolidated financial information of
Parent for the six months ended March 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2022, and the periods
November 9, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and October 1, 2021 to November 8, 2021, which has been derived from the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Parent. Due to the impact of the Solenis Acquisition by
Parent on November 9, 2021, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial information of Parent for the

not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but we believe they provide investors with useful information to

**Company Overview**

**_History and Evolution_**

The Escrow Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. Parent, doing business as “Solenis” from November 9, 2021, was formed on June 29, 2021 in connection
with the Solenis Acquisition as an exempted limited partnership registered and domiciled under the laws of the
Cayman Islands. Parent and several other holding companies and partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum.
Parent exists as the “successor” entity for the specific purposes of (1) having consummated the Solenis Acquisition,
and (2) having received the Sigura Contribution. Accordingly, the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition and the
Sigura Contribution resulted in the consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses into
the business of Parent from November 9, 2021. On September 9, 2022, Clearon was acquired by Parent and its
subsidiaries from Hui Yu Xin American LLC.

Data.”

Diversey maintains 21 manufacturing facilities (including the “Project Mega” plant facility (the new
manufacturing and warehouse facility site located in northern Kentucky)) in 17 countries around the globe to allow
Diversey to provide efficient and effective service to its customers across 80 countries. Diversey employs a team of
more than 9,000 professionals (including approximately 1,400 technicians to provide on-site services to customers).

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) of $2.8 billion and $352 million, respectively,
reflecting a 13% Adjusted EBITDA margin. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020,
Diversey generated Net sales of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of

million, $65 million and $46 million, respectively, on dosing and dispensing expenditures.

**_Combined Company_**

We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will create a platform with a shared commercial
focus and significant global scale in complementary end markets. After giving effect to the Transactions, the
combined company will be able to grow and provide a number of attractive cross-selling opportunities, including
meeting customers’ increasing demand for “one-stop shop” service models across water management, cleaning and
hygiene solutions.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to be better positioned to benefit from growing
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and macroeconomic trends, including those around customer
sustainability goals and focus points, such as: heightened focus on water consumption and recycling; the need for
improved energy efficiency and raw material management; increased consumer focus on hygiene; increased
environmental legislation being implemented globally; and increased levels of shipping and packaging. Together,
we will offer a diverse, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, which will limit any obsolescence risk as
no product or solution represents a material part of our business.

Solenis’ and Diversey’s combined segment, geographic and end market breakdown by revenue for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2023 is illustrated below.[(1) ]

(1) Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

Our leading technology has been at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry and we
have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products that we expect will drive significant value for our customers.
The combination of Solenis and Diversey represents the coming together of two leading global products, services,
and technologies providers with proven track records of product innovation who offer truly differentiated solutions
to customers.

Prior to the Transactions, we already operate across a diverse set of growing end markets and our broad
geographic reach allows us to meet the needs of our customers globally. After giving effect to the Transactions, our
combined footprint will continue to span six continents, with reinforced strength and scale of presence, with an
increased number of laboratories and production facilities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve
all major developed markets and are closely integrated with our customers throughout the world. After giving effect
to the Transactions, through our global presence and differentiated service offering in growing markets, we believe
we will be a leading provider in all of our segments and will continue to benefit from positive secular trends such as
e-commerce for customers, an increased demand for sustainable packaging, a focus on ESG and incremental
disposable income increases in emerging markets. The following graphic summarizes the geographic reach of

-----

laboratories and production facilities of the combined Solenis company following the Transactions. After giving
effect to the Transactions, we will operate 70 manufacturing facilities and 18 laboratories in 23 countries.

(1) Includes research, customer application, and development sites.
(2) Pro forma for Project Mega facility and associated plant consolidations. See “—Growth Strategy.”

There is limited existing overlap between Solenis’ and Diversey’s offerings in water treatment chemicals
with legacy Solenis operating in the water treatment and pool solutions markets and legacy Diversey operating in the
food and beverage and institutional end markets. We believe the combined company platform will be able to “circle
the customer” and create opportunities for new business wins, increasing our customer spending. For example in
hotels today, Solenis has a limited presence in pool solutions while Diversey provides kitchen care, building care,
floor care, infection prevention and laundry care. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe the fact that
Solenis and Diversey provide different services to their combined customers will provide the combined company
with the opportunity to offer existing hotel customers our full suite of products and services, including water
treatment. Similarly, Solenis does not currently serve cruise ships or hospitals but will have the opportunity to offer
its services to Diversey’s customers in these markets. Protein processing plants are another customer type that each
of Solenis and Diversey have a moderate presence with, and going forward, a combined company platform may
enable both companies to expand their offerings with such customers. We believe the Transactions present the
opportunity to combine our existing services into a “one-stop shop” provider across water management, cleaning
and hygiene solutions for our customers. The following graphic summarizes the potential cross-selling opportunities
for the combined company.

4


-----

After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be able to implement near-term strategic
initiatives in the legacy Diversey to better optimize processes, drive growth and create value. Some key initiatives
will include (i) increasing scale by bundling our leading global cleaning and water treatment solutions across
Industrial and Food & Beverage to increase win rates and cross-selling opportunities, (ii) increasing efficiencies by
standardizing corporate functions, (iii) implementing a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, (iv)
investing in growth opportunities such as expansion efforts within: North America commercial and institutional,
high growth global strategic accounts (“GSAs”), distributor partnerships and building out new product introduction
(NPI) capabilities and (v) applying our performance management capabilities to existing processes. We believe by
creating real-time visibility into financial performance we will be able to drive accountability at a more localized
level and assist in informing business decisions (such as pricing and have better insight into profitability and
distributors’ sell-through). We believe we will be able to further supplement our efforts by deploying commercial
excellence tools such as roll-outs and trainings. Additionally, we believe we can continue implementing Diversey’s
“Project Mega” by continuing to develop Diversey’s manufacturing and warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky
alongside consolidating certain existing service centers to provide manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and
insourcing opportunities.

We believe our business exhibits highly attractive financial characteristics, including significant recurring
revenues, improving margin profile and substantial free cash flow conversion. The combined company will provide
greater scale, a broader global reach, superior customer service capabilities and a number of attractive cross-selling
opportunities. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we generated pro forma Net sales on a combined
historical basis and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) of $7.2
billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, inclusive of $205 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from
actions expected to be taken within 24 months after the Acquisition and $40 million of cumulative run-rate annual
cost synergies from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and $13
million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24
months of the Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. We believe our combined earnings profile after giving effect to the
Transactions will generate significant free cash flow, which we expect will be used to support growth initiatives and
drive de-leveraging.

We believe that the Transactions create an opportunity to realize meaningful synergies resulting from the
integration of Solenis and Diversey. In combining these two complementary businesses, we believe the combined
company is entering a new and exciting chapter in a long history of helping customers address core challenges such
as water and energy management, partnering on sustainability issues to work towards a cleaner, safer world, and
reducing environmental impacts. We expect to realize approximately $205 million of synergies from integration
related to the consolidation of support functions and sales teams, the consolidation of sourcing of direct materials,
and the consolidation of facilities between the two businesses, as a result of actions expected to be taken within 24
months of the closing of the Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such
synergies. For more information on anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may impact our ability to
achieve such synergies or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the
Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the
adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies
and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies).”

**_Pool Solutions Segment (12% of Combined Company Net Sales)_**

Our Pool Solutions segment offers water care solutions and value-added services for residential and
commercial pools and spas. The water treatment process begins with testing; specifically pool pH and chlorine
levels on a weekly basis. The next step is balancing, i.e., maintaining certain levels of pH, total alkalinity and
calcium hardness. Sanitizing, which is keeping water clean and disinfected, is most frequently done using stabilized
chlorine products. Specialty maintenance products such as algaecides and clarifiers are typically used on a semimonthly basis, in addition to the normal sanitizing process, to target specific pool needs such as algae prevention or
stain control. Lastly, shock treatment can be used to address one-off pool care needs, especially following inclement
weather and high pool usage.

We are a leading producer of pool chemicals for the residential and commercial markets worldwide and
provide various water treatment products including shock, sanitizer, specialty maintenance products, and test strips.
Our offerings include a full suite of products and applications aimed at public pools, health clubs, aquatic parks,
hotels, motels, apartments and condominiums in the form of water-soluble pods, convenient floaters and automatic
feeders. Our portfolio of brands includes iconic brands such HTH®, Poolife®, GLB®, Leisure Time® and HTH

Spa®. We believe we are the world’s largest producer of calcium-hypoclorite (“cal-hypo”), a primary chemical used
in water treatment and sanitation.

We believe we are one of only two players with a complete brand and product offering in the U.S. pool and
spa chemicals market and we believe we are the only player with a truly global offering. We have total market
access to all residential channels from Mass Retail (40.6% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023), to Professional Dealer (29.3% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31,
2023), to Commercial (10.1% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023), to Repack
and Private Label (18.7% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023) and Other Pool
(1.3% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023), as well as growing e-commerce
and Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) channels. Demand for products from the Pool Solutions segment is driven by the
existing installed base of pools in the regions it operates, which have seen growth tailwinds due to COVID-driven
investment in outdoor spaces. Going forward, ongoing maintenance of these pools will drive sustainable and
recurring future demand for our products. The Pool Solutions segment generated 12% of pro forma Net sales for the
combined Solenis company for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

We have relationships with key customers across channels including in (i) the mass retail market: Walmart,
Ace Hardware, Amazon and Costco; (ii) the pro dealer market: Pool Corp, Leslie’s Poolmart, Poolwerx, Heritage
Pool Group and a large fragmented base of individual pool and spa dealers; and (iii) in the commercial market: Pool
Corp, Sea World and Bellagio.

In our Institutional Solutions segment we will serve a wide range of customers. Representative customers
will include: Vizient, Ahold / Delhaize, Radisson, BP, ISS, Walmart, Sodexo, Accor, McDonald’s, Compass Group,
Yum! Brands, Intrakoop, Aramark and Amazon. We will be one of the major global players within the segment,
therefore, we believe we will have the product breadth, scale, supply chain flexibility and service capabilities to
compete with Ecolab. Further, we believe there is an opportunity to capture customers within underserved sectors
such as cruise ships, logistics, warehousing, casinos, and theme parks.

We believe that our Institutional Solutions segment’s revenue base will be recurring and stable due to the
‘sticky’ nature of our business model. Our cleaning products will be consumable in nature and require periodic
replacement, generating highly recurring revenue. Additionally, the optimal application of our chemicals will be
controlled by our proprietary dosing and dispensing equipment installed at customer sites, which will increase
customer switching costs and generate operating efficiencies for our customers. Based on a third-party report
completed in February 2023, manufacturing and commercial and healthcare and hospitality end markets are growing
at a CAGR of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively for the four year period 2022 to 2026. The Institutional Solutions
segment generated 27% of pro forma Net sales for the combined Solenis company for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023.

We believe that our Food & Beverage segment’s revenue base will be recurring and stable. Our CleaningIn-Place (“CIP”) and Open Plant Systems will integrate our chemicals, lubricants, floor care equipment, and
cleaning and dispensing tools, while our highly skilled technical application experts will help customers achieve
production efficiencies through customized solutions that utilize our products. The highly integrated and customized
nature of the resulting solutions are expected to drive operational efficiencies as well as high switching costs for our
customers, leading to very high customer retention. The food and beverage industry is widely fragmented and we
believe the combined company has the ability to win business driven by an increasing customer demand for water
treatment being bundled with food and beverage solutions. Based on a third-party report completed in February
2023, food and beverage is growing at a CAGR of 6.5% for the four year period 2022 to 2026. The Food &
Beverage segment generated 12% of pro forma Net sales for the combined Solenis company for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023.

_Customers_

We serve a large base of customers across a diverse set of end markets. Our customer base for the
combined company includes many of the top paper and industrial players across our Industrial Solutions and
Consumer Solutions segments, including WestRock, International Paper, and Marathon Petroleum, across big-box
retailers such as Wal-Mart and Leslie’s Poolmart in our Pool Solutions segment, across Compass, ISS and
McDonald’s in our Institutional Solutions segment and across PepsiCo and Nestle in our Food & Beverage segment.
We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will further reduce customer concentration. For the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023, the top ten customers for the combined company represent approximately 12% of
total pro forma combined company Net sales with the largest customer representing approximately 2% of pro forma
combined company Net sales. As of March 31, 2023, at Solenis, the top ten customers represented approximately
19% of total Net sales with the top three customers representing approximately 11%. Historically, large accounts
have grown 1.3x faster than the base business, driven by collaboration with customers on new technology
development, embedded service engineers and focus on consistent delivery and service. As of March 31, 2023 at
Diversey, customer concentration was relatively in line with that of Solenis so low customer concentration is set to
become even less concentrated as a result of the combination of Solenis and Diversey. Further, Diversey is a major
global player with capabilities to serve GSAs, which represents approximately 20% of revenue. Both Solenis and
Diversey have long-tenured, diverse and high quality customer relationships.

We believe our customer base is inherently sticky, attributable to the mission critical nature and service-led
models that Solenis and Diversey provide, leading to highly recurring, non-discretionary spend on products and
services. On-site technicians, employees and equipment at customer locations create high switching costs and
disruption risk. As a result, we believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately 97% recurring, driven by our
differentiated solutions and value proposition and will continue to remain over 97% recurring in the combined
company.

_Suppliers & Procurement_

We source materials from multiple suppliers creating low supply chain concentration. On April 30, 2021,
Solenis and BASF agreed to extend the supply agreements applicable to certain products that are critical to Solenis’
supply chain and for which Solenis takes all of BASF’s production, which now will not expire until November
2028. Our largest raw material spend includes General Liquids (5.4% of total spend), Caustic and Chlorine (3.3% of
total spend), Acrylonitrile (2.9% of total spend), HDPE (2.2% of total spend) and Sodium Hydroxide (2.1% of total
spend) resulting in a top five materials of 15.9% or $590 million. The top five key suppliers represent 23% of total
expenditure, or $854 million, with the top supplier representing 13% of total expenditure.

The following graphic summarizes our pro forma combined company expenditure on raw materials and to
key suppliers for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

###### Raw Materials Key Suppliers

**Industry Overview**

**_Specialty Chemicals – Consumer_**

The Consumer market is comprised of water treatment chemicals and solutions for pulp and paper specific
process applications (e.g., strength additives and sizing agents across wet-end/dry-end of paper process). Based on a
report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, the global Consumer market was estimated to be
approximately $8 billion in 2020.

The Packaging market is one of the key market segments within the Consumer market that can be broken
into consumer packaging and food packaging. Based on the same report, the Consumer packaging market was
estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 3.4% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030,
which we believe will be driven primarily from the growth of e-commerce and megatrends in pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics and beauty. Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023
was generated from the consumer packaging market. Based on the same report, the food packaging market was
estimated to be $1.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030
(including food packaging barrier film expected to grow at a 4.7% CAGR), driven by increased demand for
ecofriendly packaging and changing lifestyles centering on more take-away and individually packed food. We
believe the shift away from plastic and the growth in the barrier coating market, which is not included in the market
size estimate, may drive additional growth in food packaging over this period. Approximately 7% of our pro forma
Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the food packaging and molded fiber
packaging market.

The Graphic & Specialty Paper market has been adversely impacted by the continued substitution of
printed material with electronic media. Reduced use of commercial office spaces in Europe and North America as a
result of COVID-19 is also a negative factor for the sector outlook. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market, based on
the same report, was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to decline at a 0.9% CAGR for the ten-year
period from 2020 to 2030. However, we have limited exposure to newsprint, which accounts for approximately
2.5% of Consumer Solutions sales, and we are shifting our focus to higher margin products to offset the expected
volume decline in this market. Approximately 5% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31,
2023 was generated from the Graphic & Specialty Paper market.

The Tissue & Towel market is benefiting from strong demographic/socioeconomic trends and increasing
hygiene standards, especially in developing markets. However, stagnating population growth in some mature
markets, and cost-cutting in the public sector and private company spending is expected to limit global market
growth. The Tissue & Towel market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2020 and is
expected to grow at a 2.6% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030. Approximately 6% of our pro forma Net
sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the Tissue & Towel market.

16


-----

**_Specialty Chemicals — Industrial_**

The industrial market supplies water treatment chemicals and solutions for heavy and light industries and
municipalities (e.g., cooling tower, boiler, influent/effluent, process water). Broadly speaking, the industrial market
consists of core water treatment which includes end markets such as pulp, mining and oil and gas, and wastewater,
which includes end markets such as municipal and industrial wastewater markets.

Based on the same report, the global industrial market was estimated to be approximately $23 billion in
2020 and is expected to grow at a 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025 for both the wastewater and
core water treatment markets. The municipal market is expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR for the five-year period
from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report, as demand continues to increase from higher per capita usage of water,
population growth and increasing regulatory demands. Growth in the core water treatment market, including both
heavy and light industrial markets, is expected to be driven by increasing sustainability and environmental policies,
growing regulatory demands and global industrial growth. This growth is expected to be highest in the food and
beverage market (5.5% CAGR for the five year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report) and the
refining and petrochemicals market (4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same
report). Approximately 20% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated
from the Industrial market.

**_Pool_**

The aftermarket for the residential pool industry is comprised of three main segments: (1) Chemicals, (2)
Equipment, Parts, and Accessories and (3) Services. Our main focus is on the Chemicals segment which is the
largest and most stable component of aftermarket pool spend.

Pool chemicals sales are tied to: (1) the pool installed base and (2) total gallons of treatable water, and not
new builds. The U.S. pool installed base has displayed long-term stability as it has consistently grown for decades,
including all years through the housing-led recession and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is
providing current tailwinds for the business. As of December 31, 2022, the installed base of U.S. in ground pools
was 9 million, based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. However, new builds
account for less than 4% of the installed base annually, meaning that new build rates are unlikely to materially
impact our long-term performance.

The Pool Solutions segment also benefits from a stable aftermarket spend that mirrors the steady dynamic
of the installed base. Our chemical-based products result in 100% aftermarket exposure, which reduces our exposure
to cyclical industry trends such as housing starts. Pool chemical use is entirely non-discretionary in that it is a
requirement for owning and using a pool. Pool owners who have already made the significant upfront investment of
constructing a pool, estimated to cost $40,000 to $100,000, will continue to purchase pool chemicals, at the de
minimis annual expense of $300 to $400 in order to maintain their pools.

The pool chemical treatment market includes products such as primary sanitizers (71% of total market
sales), specialty chemicals, other shocks and alternative sanitizers. Primary sanitizers include cal-hypo, sodium
hypochlorite (“sodium-hypo”), trichlor, dichlor and packaged shocks. The total market for U.S. residential pool
chemicals, based on retail dollar value, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2020 and grew by 28% in 2021 to
approximately $3.4 billion, primarily due to higher prices resulting from scarcity of chlorine based on a recent study
by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We believe the U.S. residential pool chemical market, on a
volume basis, will exceed the expected growth of the installed base of U.S. residential pools, which was estimated to
be 3.0% from 2020 to 2025 based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We
further believe that volumes in our pool solutions segment will exceed the market as we expand our customer base
and increase market sale with new dealer relationships and e-commerce.

**_Institutional_**

The Institutional Solutions market growth is driven by an aging population, increasing demand for
healthcare facilities, return to office policies continued to drive an increase demand for cleaning, the introduction of
new sanitization standards arising post-COVID and a focus on new infrastructure bills to expand healthcare and
transportation networks. Based on a third-party report completed in February 2023, the Institutional Solutions

17


-----

segment is growing at a CAGR of 5.3% for the four year period 2022 to 2026. The manufacturing and commercial
and healthcare and hospitality sub-end markets are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for
the four year period 2022 to 2026.

**Global Institutional Market Size (2022 – 2026) [(1)(2) ]**

(1) Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

(2) Note: Based on data from an expert third-party advisor.

**_Food & Beverage_**

The Food & Beverage market growth is driven by an increase in governmental concerns over food safety
and oversight driving increased regulation, shifting consumer preferences in (1) mature markets, towards organic
and simple and (2) in emerging markets, towards more processed foods and a growing global population driving
increased consumption of food and beverage. Based on a third-party report completed in February 2023, the Food &
Beverage segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% for the four year period 2022 to 2026.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

_Consumer Solutions_

We believe, based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, that we are the
market leader in specialty chemicals for the Consumer Solutions segment. Based on the same report, we believe that
we maintain market leadership positions in almost all technologies and regions. The competitive landscape, as
segmented by geography or technology, remains fragmented. We have particularly strong market positions in
process chemicals within the biocide, contaminant control, defoamer, tissue specialties and pulp specialties
technologies.

Our strength is based on the complete product portfolio, premium product performance and strong technical
support we offer. We believe we have the best and the broadest offering to help customers achieve their operational
efficiencies. We are a trusted supplier known for our data analytics capacities, with a focus on service excellence,
sustainability, productivity and cost savings for our customers.

Many customers are starting to embrace digital technology / data analytics to help track performance and
starting to partner with suppliers with strong R&D capabilities to develop innovative solutions to drive efficiency
and achieve sustainability objectives. This trend is expected to continue and we expect to benefit from it due to our
robust value-added chemistry and technology solutions offering.

_Industrial Solutions_

The global industrial water chemicals market is fragmented, with the top seven players, based on a report
by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021. This is due to the required application-specific expertise and
track-record of performance. Hence, by region and by end-user market, three to five players may have a
disproportionately high share. We believe we have an outsized share of the global pulp and paper market, which is
one of our larger markets within the Industrial Solutions segment.

We believe we offer the lowest per unit cost for comparable chemicals compared to our industry peers and
believe that the competitive pricing is our greatest strength in the Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we
offer an array of innovative solutions and comprehensive product lines both in core water treatment and wastewater
segment. Notable competitors include Ecolab / Nalco, Suez, ChemTreat, Kurita, Kemira and SNF. Ecolab, which
acquired Nalco in 2011, is the largest water treatment player followed by Suez.

Similar to the Consumer market, technology and R&D are becoming increasingly important beyond the
chemical product itself as customers are moving towards advanced analytics to optimize the volume of chemical
treatment, driving select industry participants to increasingly focus on equipment / engineering solutions as opposed
to chemical solutions.

20


-----

_Pool Solutions_

We believe we are the only true global player in the Pool Solutions segment with leading market positions
in North America, South America, and EMEA. We believe the acquisition of Clearon further enhanced our market
leading position. Our primary competitor in this segment is KIK Custom Products, which provides various pool
chemical solutions, with a focus on North America. Other smaller competitors also compete in this market, with
varying breadth and geographical focus, including Hasa Pool, Jandy, Lo-chlor and Jack’s Magic.

We believe we are the world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment
and sanitation. All three of our cal-hypo facilities are co-located with chlor-alkali producers meaning that raw
materials (chlorine and caustic soda) are delivered into our production plants via a direct pipeline. We believe this is
a major competitive advantage and barrier to entry in the Pool Solutions segment as we believe it would not be
economical for our competitors to open a new cal-hypo facility that is not co-located with a supply of raw materials.

The acquisition of Clearon provided additional manufacturing capabilities for trichlor and dichlor and we
are now the only producer of cal-hypo, trichlor and dichlor, which we believe will give us a significant advantage
over our competitors. Further, Clearon’s manufacturing facility located in West Virginia was isolated from the
impact of natural disasters that other competitors have experienced with facilities located on the Gulf Coast.

_Institutional Solutions_

Diversey is a major global player in the Institutional Solutions segment and competes primarily with
Ecolab. Other competitors in this segment include: SC Johnson, Gojo, Kalykim and Jasol. In this highly fragmented
market, Diversey and Ecolab together hold approximately a 20% global market share. Geographically, Diversey
believes it is the number one or number two player in the North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin
America and Asia-Pacific regions. Other competitors are focused on niche segments and geographies, focusing on
regional and local customers.

Diversey is positioned to compete using a recurring revenue business model built on consumable products
that require periodic replacement and high customer switching costs via a suite of proprietary dosing and dispensing
equipment installed at customer sites. Further, to better compete with Ecolab in North America, Diversey is in the
process of opening a new co-manufacturing / co-warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky, alongside consolidating
certain existing service centers to increase manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be better positioned to compete with Ecolab
for leadership across all markets. We believe that the combined company is best positioned to capture share on a
global scale due to Diversey’s strong existing market position, combined with our own position and track record of
sustained growth and the white space afforded by such a fragmented market.

_Food & Beverage_

Diversey is one of the only two global players in the Food & Beverage segment and competes primarily
with Ecolab. The Food & Beverage market is largely consolidated and Diversey and Ecolab together hold
approximately half of the global market share. Ecolab and Diversey generally compete within cleaning and hygiene
solutions. Other, smaller competitors exist including Zep, Reckitt and Kersia. These players tend to service more
regional markets and operate with highly limited product and distribution capabilities.

Prior to the Transactions, we entered into a distribution relationship with Diversey through which we
provide water treatment products to be marketed to Diversey’s existing customer base within its Food & Beverage
segment. This current offering sets Diversey apart from Ecolab and represents an opportunity for additional market
capture and cross-selling in the future following the consummation of the Transactions.

**_Sustainability and Environmental and Social Governance_**

We drive sustainability by reducing water and energy use and raw materials waste while improving
operational productivity. Increased focus on sustainability and ESG is a key trend across both Consumer Solutions
and Industrial Solutions segments and is driving demand as our customers aim to reduce water and energy

21


-----

consumption, optimize raw materials spend and reduce waste emission. These objectives require increased chemical
use which is driving increased demand for our business. Institutional products are designed to enhance cleanliness,
safety, environmental sustainability, and efficiency needed to serve our customers in the healthcare, education, food
service, retail and grocery, hospitality, and building service contractor industries. Food & Beverage solutions will
maximize food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability for our customers in the brewing, beverage, dairy,
processed foods, pharmaceutical and agriculture industries.

At the micro level, we provide solutions to customers with specific sustainability goals. For example, our
offering of PFAS-free oil and grease resistant technology has been selected by major brand owners as a replacement
in food service bowls. We also made a series of recommendations to a chemical company which resulted in a
reduction of 28,000 cubic meters of water per year and 3,000 tons of CO2 emissions. The resulting savings for our
customer were approximately $27 million per year. Further, our cal-hypo-based shocks that are sold at big-box
retailers eliminate the need to drain and refill pools due to over stabilization, resulting in potential water savings of
up to 600 gallons per pound used instead of dichlor and we estimate approximate water savings of up to 25 billion
gallons per year. Diversey’s Clax® Advanced laundry solution supports clean and bright laundry at low wash
temperatures to lower operational costs and reduce its customers’ environmental impact. Further, its delivers
excellent linen hygiene and extends linen life. Clax® Advanced provides solutions in a variety of industrial laundry
applications globally such as hotels and nursing homes, with substantial operational savings in conserving energy
and water while reducing waste. Benefits of this offering include: (1) up to a 35% reduction in water use (or 8,000
kilo liters; the equivalent of three Olympic swimming pools), (2) up to a 40% reduction in steam use (or 600 metric
tons), up to a 15% reduction in electricity use (or 5,000 kilowatt hour), (3) up to a 16% reduction in wash time (or
~150 work days), (4) up to 35% effluent (or 8,000 kilo liters), (5) up to 100 metric tons reduction in CO2 emissions
and (6) up to 30% extension in linen life. Our management is dedicated to, and focused on, building and marketing
our strong ESG reputation, shifting to green products and providing value-added services to help our customers

**Summary of Operational Improvements and Synergies Initiatives related to the Acquisition**

We, along with Platinum, have identified expected synergies resulting from the Transactions. We identified
an estimated $205 million in net annual cost synergies expected to be implemented within 24 months of closing the
Transactions which are expected to be realized through consolidation of support and sales functions, materials
sourcing consolidation and facility consolidation, as follows:

22


-----

    - Approximately $97 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved through organizational
design opportunities via consolidation of Diversey’s back office into Solenis’ across the finance,
information technology, human resources, legal, environmental, health and safety, commercial,
research and development and marketing functions. The foregoing includes $51 million in optimizing
overall organizational structure and number of employees for key functions, $33 million in elimination
of redundant leadership positions and management roles and $14 million for the leveraging of existing
shared service centers across the combined company.

    - Approximately $44 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved related to direct and indirect
sourcing opportunities, including $30 million related to leveraging combined chemicals and
commodities spend and higher purchasing power to drive more favorable contracts by both product
type and supplier and $13 million related to leveraging combined indirect spend categories with
supplier rationalization to reduce fragmentation and tail spend in certain categories, consolidation of
technologies, and telecom, network and data center optimization.

    - Approximately $64 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved through manufacturing and
distribution center optimization and consolidation, transportation logistics efficiencies and real estate
consolidation, including $23 million related to consolidating overlapping footprints and removing
excess capacity, $37 million related to optimizing outbound transportation based on facility
consolidation and production shifts between plants to optimize shipping networks to nearest point of
origin, procuring freight more effectively and improving contract compliance, and $5 million related to
optimizing office footprint to reduce redundancies, underutilized office space by renegotiating leases
and eliminating smaller offices with little to no headcount by converting to remote work or providing
alternative locations.

To achieve the identified synergies, we expect to incur approximately $190 million in total of one-time
costs related to severance, retention, information technology system integration and consulting, among other costs.

The initiatives to realize the Transactions synergies have and will be executed by a dedicated
implementation team with support from Platinum operational executives and third-party resources. However, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these synergies or operational improvements. For more
information about our anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may affect our ability to achieve such
synergies or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Legacy

**Summary of Operational Improvements and Synergies Initiatives related to the Legacy Acquisitions**

We, along with Platinum, identified synergies resulting from the Solenis Acquisition. We achieved $40
million in annual cost synergies from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing
Date.

23


-----

We, along with Platinum, also identified expected synergies resulting from the Clearon Acquisition. We
identified an estimated $13 million in net annual cost synergies from actions taken or expected to be taken within 24
months of closing the Clearon Acquisition. As of March 31, 2023, we have achieved $6.5 million and expect to
achieve $6.5 million from actions taken to date or to be taken in the next 15 months. These synergies are expected to
be realized through headcount rationalization and non-labor optimization spend net of certain incremental expenses.

The initiatives to realize both the Solenis Acquisition and Clearon Acquisition synergies have and will
continue to be executed by a dedicated implementation team with support from Platinum operational executives and
third-party resources. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the remaining synergies or
operational improvements. For more information about our anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may

**Competitive Strengths**

**_Leading Provider in Growing Water Intensive and Relatively Recession Resilient End Markets_**

We believe the size of Solenis’ total addressable market was $39 billion as of 2020 and that the market is
relatively fragmented, with four top players, presenting an opportunity for us to capture share. Further, we believe
the size of Diversey’s total addressable market is $46 billion. Our combined platform will create a scaled leader
across all water intensive industries. Based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, we
believe that we have the #1 market position in the Consumer Solutions segment and are one of the top market
players in the highly fragmented Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we believe we are one of two top
players in the U.S. pool and spa chemicals market. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe we will be one
of the top players in the Institutional Solutions and Food & Beverage markets.

We serve a variety of growing diverse water-intensive end markets, including consumer chemicals

**_Global Leader with Diverse Sticky Customer Base_**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a large geographical footprint that enables us to
provide global service to our customers. We are present on six continents, with both laboratories and production
facilities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve all major developed markets. After giving effect
to the Transactions, we will have approximately 15,600 employees with a substantial presence across the North
Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. Our strategic global footprint allows us to efficiently and effectively serve
customers around the world by providing consistent products and service. Diversey offers further expansion
opportunities, particular given by its strength in EMEA.

Our service and technical abilities are mission critical to our customers. Typically our trained value-add
employees, scientists, and service engineers are embedded at customers’ sites, creating strong and long-term
relationships. We represent a lower overall percentage of our customers’ cost base and have been able to achieve
significant value add documented savings for our customers. We are highly engrained in our customers’ workflow,
and it is often difficult, expensive, and potentially disruptive for customers to switch to a competitor. As a result, we
believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately 97% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and value
proposition and will continue to remain over 97% recurring in the combined company. After giving effect to the
Transactions, the top ten customers for the combined company are expected to represent approximately 12% of total
Net sales with the largest customer representing approximately 2% of the combined company Net sales.

**_Differentiated Business Model with Best in Class Service, Chemistry, and Technology_**

We believe our suite of comprehensive products and services unlocks customer value as a result of our
industry leading employees and innovative technology offerings. Our solutions represent a small portion of our
customers’ overall end costs and provide a significant return on investment. Our differentiated service model, with
approximately 2,400 of our sales and service engineers on site with our customers, leads to highly recurring, nondiscretionary spending on our products and services, and with our solutions and value propositions including
industry leading technology and equipment and artificial intelligence abilities, Solenis was able to achieve $179
million of value-add documented savings for our customers in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

We offer innovative chemistries to address customers’ operational and sustainability challenges while our
technology is at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry. Further, we have product
development capabilities to meet customers’ new and evolving needs, based on three main pillars. First, we have
approximately 270 dedicated research and development professionals with two-thirds of our annual technology
spend supporting those efforts. Second, our innovation pipeline includes approximately 47 projects, representing
significant potential run-rate revenue, and features approximately 4,130 patents, including patents for chemical and
equipment technologies. In total, Solenis has 2,259 patents issued and 613 patents currently pending, while Diversey
has 1,108 patents issued and 150 patents currently pending. Lastly, our strategically located facilities around the
world focus on analyzing and diagnosing products and processes, as well as conducting testing to recommend
effective improvements that enhance both productivity and quality for our customers. This is critical as new and
innovative products carry a higher than average margin and this mix shift is expected to drive increased profitability
for our business.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Top Line Growth, Expanding Margins, and Robust Free Cash Flow_**
**_Generation_**

Our global business has shown strong topline growth, and we believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately
97% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and value proposition and will continue to remain over 97%
recurring in the combined company, with the core business growing during the COVID-19 pandemic. By optimizing
our cost structure through a strict focus on maximizing operational efficiencies using new technologies, reducing
redundancies and leveraging existing infrastructure, we have seen improved Adjusted EBITDA growth and
attractive margin expansion. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) margin was approximately 18%. Our topline growth and
price increases offsetting inflation along with low working capital intensity and minimal capital expenditures allow
for significant free cash flow generation. See “—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data.”

**_Long Tenured, Industry Leading Management Team with Strong Track Record_**

We have an experienced management team with long tenures in the industry and experience in the sector,
which has been recognized as a US Best Managed Company by Deloitte and The Wall Street Journal for 2021, 2022
and 2023. We are led by John E. Panichella, who has been CEO of Solenis since its inception in 2014, following the
initial carve-out from Ashland. Through organic growth and M&A, particularly the merger with BASF, Panichella
has steered Solenis to global leadership in the specialty chemicals for water-intensive industries. Prior to leading
Solenis, John served as President of AWT, SVP of Ashland, Group Operating Officer of Ashland Specialty
Ingredients and AWT, and President of Ashland Aqualon Functional ingredients. Surrounding John is a deep bench
across operations, technology, commercial and finance, including Philip M. Patterson, Jr, our CFO, Edward
Connors, President of the Americas, Jacques Herber, President of Eurasia, and Robert Baird, President of the Pool
Solutions business. Our experienced team will drive long-term stability of the business and support future growth.

**Growth Strategy**

We believe we are well positioned to grow organically and capture share through several distinct strategies.
Supportive end market trends that drove historical growth are expected to continue over the next five to ten years.
We have successfully maintained strong pricing discipline to offset inflationary increases to input costs and shift
customers to a more profitable mix, driving margin growth. The combination creates unique, value accretive
synergy opportunities, with line of sight on approximately $205 million of estimated cost synergies (resulting from
actions expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions). Additionally, we achieved $40
million of cost synergies related to the Solenis Acquisition from actions that were taken within 18 months of the
Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and we identified $13 million of cost synergies related to the Clearon Acquisition
which are expected to be realized from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24 months of the
Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. As of March 31, 2023, we have realized $6.5 million of cost synergies related to
the Clearon Acquisition.

We are also well positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions via multiple M&A avenues. We have
a proven track record as an M&A platform, with 17 transactions completed since 2014, including the transformative
fiscal year 2019 merger with BASF’s water and paper business and the Solenis Acquisition in fiscal year 2022. We
believe there is an opportunity for both strategic bolt-ons and transformational targets going forward.

**_Well Positioned to Grow with Macro and ESG Mega Trends_**

We believe our sophisticated product development capabilities meet our customers’ evolving needs and
help keep us at the forefront of macroeconomic trends. Our ability to evolve is based on three pillars that allow us to
grow our product offering alongside client demands: R&D, Innovation and Customer Application Laboratories. Our
R&D team has approximately 270 dedicated professionals and two thirds of annual technology investment supports
R&D. Our robust innovation pipeline currently has approximately 47 projects and features approximately 4,130
patents, including those for chemical and equipment technologies. In total we have 3,367 patents issued and 763
patents currently pending. Customer application laboratories are strategically located facilities around the world
focused on analyzing and diagnosing products and processes, as well as conducting testing to recommend effective
improvements that enhance both productivity and quality.

We focus on solving our customers’ environmental and sustainability challenges, placing us at the forefront
of the ESG mega trend. Through identification of specific goals such as reduction of water consumption, reduction

27


-----

of energy consumption, reduction of waste emissions or optimization of raw materials utilization, we have been able
to work with customers to meet their unique needs. Our sophisticated capabilities have helped customers meet
evolving sustainability goals and achieve measurable results.

**_Pricing Discipline to Drive Margin Growth_**

We have a track-record of actively monitoring and managing prices, enabling the pass-through of raw
material cost increases to maintain margins. Through Solenis’ value-documentation program, sales teams have
accountability requirements to show that at least 5% of Net sales deliver a value advantage to customers, which
enables price capture even in deflationary environments. This has enabled us to pass through a majority of increases
in raw chemical materials, which are one of the major drivers for cost inflation, to customers by adjusting prices
accordingly. We began to see a significant increase in the price of our raw materials, including ethylene and
propylene, during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and we began to pass on price increases to our
customers. Typically, we experience an approximately 90-day lag in implementing our price increases, however,
during the six months ended March 31, 2023, we exceeded our goals and were able to drive price increases even
faster with price exceeding cost during the six months ended March 31, 2023 in all of our business segments.

While Diversey continues to adjust prices to pass through increases in raw materials costs, Diversey was
slower to react to the inflationary cost environment than Solenis, which resulted in more pronounced margin
compression throughout 2022 than Solenis. Once combined, Diversey’s performance is expected to improve as they
will operate on Solenis’ value-documentation program. Typically, Diversey experiences an approximately 90-day
lag in implementing our price increases, however, during the six months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey exceeded
its goals and was able to drive price increases even faster with Cost of goods sold inflation during the six months
ended March 31, 2023 in its Institutional Solutions and Food & Beverage segments.

The charts below summarize our and Diversey’s success in implementing price increases and maintaining
price ahead of cost.

**_Enhance Profitability Through Identified Synergies and Operational Improvements_**

We believe that through the realization of the synergies and operational improvement initiatives, which we
have identified together with Platinum, we will enhance our profitability and support our strategic initiatives. The
approximately $205 million of synergies was identified with the collaboration of the Solenis and Diversey
management teams, along with Platinum, and reflect actions which we believe can be implemented within 24
months of the closing of the Transactions. The Platinum team has an extensive track record of leveraging our
operational resources to achieve anticipated cost savings.

28

We cannot assure you we will be able to achieve all of these cost synergies. For more information about
our anticipated cost synergies and operational improvements, including certain factors that may affect our ability to
achieve such cost synergies and operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and
the Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the
adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies
and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies).”

**_Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions_**

While our primary focus is on organic growth, our global presence, scale and broad product offering
position us well to execute on opportunistic acquisitions given the large and fragmented nature of the markets we
serve or to expand into new markets. We estimate that the markets adjacent to our market represent a total market
size of $42 billion and represent potential expansion areas, including the ion exchange and coagulants markets. We
believe that we can create significant value through strategic acquisitions given our track record of integration.
Solenis has completed 17 acquisitions since 2014, including the transformative and successful merger with BASF’s
water and paper business in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and the Solenis Acquisition in fiscal year
2022. We will focus on maintaining a disciplined acquisition strategy centered on: (i) expanding our customer base
in new and growing end markets and geographies; (ii) improving our customer offering through access to new
products and technological capabilities; and (iii) generating significant purchasing and other operational synergies.

The graphic below sets forth a summary of our acquisitions since 2014.

29

**_Strategically Invest in High Return Capital Expenditures Expansion_**

Our key capital expenditure projects include production capacity expansion for polyvinyl amine (“PVAM”)
at our Suffolk, Virginia facility and calcium hypochlorite (cal-hypo) at our Charleston, Tennessee and Kempton
Park, South Africa facilities. Our expansion efforts will eliminate existing capacity constraints and better position us
to capitalize on customer demand for these high-margin products. Our engineering estimates for all facilities are
underway with expansion efforts expected to be online in 2026. We expect the PVAM and cal-hypo expansions to
cost $150 million and $100 million, respectively.

A majority of our customers, especially those producing packaging and tissue and towel products, are
focused on improving strength. We are a market leader in strength chemistry, with the broadest portfolio of synthetic
strength additives like PVAM and are the leading supplier of global PVAM production. Previously PVAM was
originally sold by BASF and we acquired full commercial rights as part of 2019 merger. However, in advance of the
merger, BASF raised prices substantially, resulting in lost sales. Post integration, we refilled the pipeline and
returned the product to growth, however, in recent years, our PVAM volumes have been constrained despite
debottlenecking programs implemented and we have been unable to return to pre-BASF merger levels. Further, in
fiscal year 2022, we experienced shutdowns and product issues resulting in production allocation and customer
management challenges. To solve our capacity constraint, we are looking to build incremental capacity at our
existing Suffolk, Virginia facility, which is expected to be online by the end of 2026 that will enable us to increase
capacity by approximately 100%.

Cal-hypo is a highly concentrated source of chlorine in solid form and is a cost-effective solution primarily
used for pool sanitization and maintenance with secondary uses to disinfect water in industrial and municipal
markets. Our Solenis HTH[ TM] and Poolife[TM] offerings are cal-hypo-based shocks that eliminate the need to drain and
refill pools due to over stabilization with other benefits including minimized storage requirements, dry formulation
for shelf stability and easy handling, reduced shipping and handling costs and reduced maintenance. We are
currently experiencing capacity constraints at our Kempton Park, South Africa facility. Further, given over 50% of
global supply is produced in either China or India, importing incremental capacity is both challenging and costly.
Due to these constraints, we are looking to expand our capacity. Expansion efforts at our Kempton Park facility are
underway and are expected to be completed by fiscal year ended 2023 or 2024. Further, we are pursuing a site
selection process for additional capacity including assessing potential new locations, with the expectation that all
facilities will be online by 2026. In the interim, we will look to temporarily source incremental capacity via third
parties to pre-seed the plant which we believe will drive top line growth in the near team and insourcing savings in
the future. Following its return to the United States market, Diversey’s current management team identified potential
manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities by re-positioning and consolidating certain
existing service centers. This supply chain improvement process is referred to as “Project Mega.”

Project Mega includes a largely complete consolidation of the North American supply chain footprint
through the creation of a manufacturing plant and co-located warehouse in Northern Kentucky, as well as warehouse
consolidation in Europe. Diversey started shipping from the new Kentucky warehouse in July 2022 and is
consolidating its manufacturing capabilities into the same Kentucky facility. Further, Project Mega is consolidating
five Diversey (three Institutional and two Food & Beverage) plants into four plants (two Institutional and two Food
& Beverage) and is planning on closing two Wisconsin plants. By co-locating its main warehouse and
manufacturing capabilities, and adding more capacity to bring currently contracted volumes in-house and optimizing
freight lanes, the project is expected to drive approximately $30 million of annual cost savings. The run rate cost
savings includes $11 million related to manufacturing efficiencies from increased insourcing from contract
manufacturers, more efficient lines and fixed absorption, co-location of liquid manufacturing and wipes conversion
and an optimized flow of processes, $10 million related to logistics and the ability to avoid shipping between sites
along with having new sites closer to suppliers and customers, $7 million related to direct savings achieved from
materials sourcing using larger orders (i.e. from drums to bulk orders), $1 million related to warehousing from lower
rent and co-locating with manufacturing and $2 million related to other.

**Prior/2021 Business Resegmentation**

Following a strategic review related to Solenis’ operating segments and in anticipation of the closing of the
Solenis Acquisition, changes were introduced in the segment reporting from October 1, 2021 onwards.

The segmentation changes were made for the following reasons: (i) to align the segment structure to ensure
that our financial reporting segments are in line with its strategic approach in demarcating its operations and (ii) to
manage the business and make business decisions based on product lines and services in the most effective manner.

Major changes to highlight included: (i) the creation of a new Pool Solutions segment to account for the
contribution of Sigura’s Pools segment, focused on delivering products for the treatment of pools, spas and water
parks, (ii) the renaming of the Pulp & Paper business as the Consumer Solutions business, (iii) the renaming of the
Industrial Water business as the Industrial Solutions business, (iv) the reallocation of the food processing aspects of
the business from the newly named Industrial Solutions business to sit with the other consumer-based products and
services within the newly named Consumer Solutions business, (v) the reallocation of the pulp processing aspects of
the business from the newly named Consumer Solutions business to sit with the other industrial-focused products
and services within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment, (vi) the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial &
Municipal Water business to the newly named Industrial Solutions segment and (vii) the inclusion of Solenis’ RSA
business within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment.

**_Consumer Solutions._** The Pulp & Paper segment of the historical Solenis business was renamed as the
Consumer Solutions segment. The Consumer Solutions segment is mostly affected by the removal of Pulp and its
reallocation to the Industrial Water segment (now renamed as the Industrial Solutions segment).

**_Industrial Solutions._** The Industrial Water segment of the historical Solenis business was renamed as the

**_The Acquisition_**

On March 8, 2023, Parent, Merger Sub and Diversey entered into the Acquisition Agreement, pursuant to
which Merger Sub will merge with and into Diversey, with Diversey surviving, following which Diversey will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Acquisition, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Diversey, with Diversey surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Diversey (other than dissenting shares) (the “Diversey
Common Stock”), will automatically be converted into the right to receive, in respect of shareholders other than
BCPE (the controlling shareholder of Diversey and an affiliate of Bain Capital), $8.40 per share, and, in respect of
BCPE $7.84 per share, in each case, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and BCPE will also
rollover a portion of its Diversey Common Stock into an affiliate of the Sponsor, and each share of Diversey
Common Stock will be cancelled, cease to be outstanding and cease to exist, and the Diversey shareholders will
cease to have any other rights with respect to their Diversey Common Stock. Parent will be deemed to be the
accounting acquirer for purposes of the Transactions.

The purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through:

    - proceeds of the Notes offered hereby;

    - borrowings under a new tranche of the Term Loan;

    - the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment; and

    - the New Equity Contribution.

For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” and “Description of Notes.”

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, among
others, (i) the affirmative vote in favor of adoption of the Acquisition Agreement by holders of at least two thirds of
the shares of Diversey Common Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, (ii) the expiration or early
termination of the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”), (iii)
the absence of any order of any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition
preventing the consummation of the Acquisition or enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Acquisition
that continues to be in effect, (iv) completion of any required information and/or consultation on procedures with a
labor organization, (v) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement), (vi) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Acquisition Agreement (subject
to certain materiality qualifications), (vii) compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the
Acquisition Agreement and (viii) obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right to terminate if the
Acquisition has not been consummated by the Outside Date. The Acquisition Agreement also contains customary
representations, warranties and covenants.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) of $2.8 billion and $352 million, respectively,
reflecting a 13% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

**_The Offering, Escrow and Escrow Release_**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior
to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will issue the Notes and deposit (or cause to be
deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series
of Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and
investments therein. The Escrow Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Unless the Acquisition
closes substantially concurrently with, or prior to, this offering, substantially concurrently with the consummation of
the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will consummate the Escrow Merger, pursuant to which it will merge with and
into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately continuing as the surviving entity. Assuming the Escrow
Release Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will
become parties to the Indenture pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures, the Escrow Issuer will cease to
exist as a result of the Escrow Merger and the obligations under the Indenture will become obligations of the
Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors.

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release
Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of
default under the Indenture has or would have occurred and is continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to
be incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the
Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each series
of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect
on the applicable series of Notes.”

The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes, together with any
earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest
on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. The Ultimate Issuer or one of its
affiliates will issue the Equity Commitment Letter to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow
Agent and the holders of the Notes, to transfer to the Escrow Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and
expenses.

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see “Description
of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**_The Refinancing_**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, we will consummate the Refinancing using proceeds from the Notes, borrowings under a new
incremental tranche of the Term Loan Facility, the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment and the New Equity
Contribution.

34


-----

**_The Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Issuer intends to borrow an incremental $750 million tranche under the Term Loan Facility and to
increase the available capacity under its ABL Revolving Credit Facility to provide for borrowings of up to $700
million, subject to borrowing base capacity.

**_New Equity Contribution and New Perpetual Preferred Equity_**

As part of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will fund a portion of the New Equity Contribution of
approximately $950 million in cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which will, through a series of transactions,
ultimately be contributed to Parent and which will be used as part of the consideration to be paid in connection with
the Acquisition. In addition as part of the Acquisition, BCPE will rollover: (i) approximately $617 million of its
existing equity interests in Diversey into common units in an indirect parent of Parent as part of the New Equity
Contribution; and (ii) approximately $438 million of its existing equity interests in Diversey into preferred units in
an indirect parent of Parent as the New Perpetual Preferred Equity, in each case, in satisfaction of a portion of the
consideration payable to BCPE under the Acquisition. From the Acquisition Closing Date until the first anniversary
thereof, Platinum or its affiliates may acquire the New Perpetual Preferred Equity from BCPE. Platinum may
exercise this option in its sole discretion following the closing of the Transactions.

interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments

secured obligations of the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors, secured on a
first-priority basis by security interests in substantially all of the assets that
secure our Term Loan Credit Agreement and Existing Secured Notes on a
first-priority basis (the “Fixed Asset Collateral”), and will be secured on a
second-priority basis in all inventory, accounts receivable, tax refunds
(other than accounts receivable and tax refunds relating to real estate,
equipment, intellectual property and capital stock), cash, deposit accounts,
securities accounts, investment property (other than capital stock and
accounts solely to hold identifiable proceeds of Fixed Asset Collateral),

parity lien indebtedness in respect of the exercise of rights and remedies
against the Issuer and the Guarantors.

In addition, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the relative
priorities of the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes offered hereby,
the Existing Secured Notes and our Term Loan Facility and other future
parity lien indebtedness, on the one hand, and our ABL Revolving Credit
Facility (or any replacement facility) and other future indebtedness that is
on a parity lien basis with the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, on the other
hand, and the relative rights of such parties to enforce such liens. See
“Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Security—
Intercreditor Arrangements.”

**Ranking .........................................** From and after satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, or on the
Issue Date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with or prior to this
offering, the Notes and the related guarantees will be general, senior
secured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and will:

40


-----

  - be secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all
parity lien indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors
(including our Existing Secured Notes and Term Loan Facility),
by security interests in all of the Fixed Asset Collateral, subject to
certain limitations and exceptions and permitted liens;

  - be secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all
parity lien indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors
(including our Existing Secured Notes and Term Loan Facility),
by security interests in all of the Current Asset Collateral, subject
to certain limitations and exceptions and permitted liens (including
liens on the Current Asset Collateral securing our ABL Revolving
Credit Facility);

  - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s
and the Guarantors’ subordinated indebtedness;

  - be effectively senior to any of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
unsecured indebtedness (including the Existing Unsecured Notes)
and indebtedness secured by liens junior to the liens securing the
Notes (including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, our
ABL Revolving Credit Facility), in each case, to the extent of the
value of the Collateral;

  - be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by a senior-priority lien,
including our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of the
value of the Current Asset Collateral;

  - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank pari passu in
right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ senior
indebtedness, including our Existing Secured Notes, Term Loan
Facility, ABL Revolving Credit Facility and Existing Unsecured
Notes;

  - be effectively equal to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
senior indebtedness secured on the same priority basis as the
Notes, including our Existing Secured Notes and our Term Loan
Facility;

  - be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the
Guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not
constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness; and

  - be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any non-Guarantor
subsidiaries.

As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions:

  - we would have had total indebtedness of 7.3 billion (excluding
existing letters of credit, performance guarantees and local lines of
credit), $6.6 billion of which would have been secured (without
giving effect to unamortized discounts and deferred financing
costs), including the Notes offered hereby;

41


-----

                   - we would have had unused commitments under the ABL
Revolving Credit Facility available to us of $640 million, subject
to borrowing base capacity; and

                   - our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 43% of
our total liabilities (excluding intercompany payables), all of
which would have been structurally senior to the Notes.

See “Capitalization” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all
obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the
Notes.”

**Additional Amounts .....................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the
Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes unless
required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law in any
“relevant taxing jurisdiction,” subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after
the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would
have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction, subject to
certain exceptions. See “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Optional Redemption ...................** Each series of Notes will be redeemable at the Issuer’s option, in whole or
in part, at any time on or after June 1, 2025, at the redemption prices set
forth in this offering memorandum, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

of the principal amount of such series of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In connection with any offer to purchase a series of Notes (including a
change of control offer and any tender offer), if holders of no less than 90%
of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Notes validly
tender their Notes, the Issuer is entitled to redeem any remaining Notes of
such series at the price offered to each holder.

See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.”

In the event of certain developments affecting taxation that become
effective after the Issue Date, the Issuer may redeem a series of Notes, as
applicable, in whole but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to,
but excluding, the date of redemption. See “Description of Notes—
Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption ...............** This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will issue the Notes and deposit (or cause to
be deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into
separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At
such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series
of Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable
escrow account and the deposits and investments therein. The Escrow
Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Unless the
Acquisition closes substantially concurrently with, or prior to, this offering,
substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the
Escrow Issuer will consummate the Escrow Merger, pursuant to which it
will merge with and into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer
ultimately continuing as the surviving entity. Assuming the Escrow Release
Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will become parties to the Indenture
pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures, the Escrow Issuer will
cease to exist as a result of the Escrow Merger and the obligations under
the Indenture will become obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The
escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the
Acquisition even if a default or event of default has occurred and is
continuing under the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to
the Outside Date and the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, the
proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or
event of default under the Indenture has or would have occurred and is
continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the
Outside Date, (b) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release
Conditions are deemed, in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, or (c) at any
time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each
series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price
equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such
special mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the

43


-----

Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not
consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on
the applicable series of Notes.”

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of
the Acquisition, the Notes will not be subject to the escrow procedures
described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating
to, the escrow, see “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

**Change of Control Offer ..............** Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change in control, subject to
certain exceptions, you will have the right, as holders of each series of
Notes, to cause the Issuer to repurchase some or all of each series of your
Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.” The Issuer may
not be able to pay you the required price for Notes you present to it at the
time of a change of control because:

                   - the Issuer may not have enough funds at that time; or

                   - the terms of our Credit Facilities or other debt facilities may
prevent the Issuer from making such payment.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We
may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or
pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

**Asset Sale Offer ............................** If Parent or any of its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer will be required to use the net proceeds to make
an offer to purchase each series of Notes at an offer price in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset
Sales.”

**Covenants ......................................** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture. The Indenture will,
among other things, limit the ability of Parent and its restricted subsidiaries
to:

                   - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

                   - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or
repurchase or redeem, its capital stock;

                   - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

                   - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;

                   - make loans and investments;

                   - sell assets;

44


-----

                   - incur liens;

                   - enter into agreements containing prohibitions affecting its
subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

                   - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

                   - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets.

These covenants will be subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications. For more details, see “Description of Notes—Certain
Covenants.”

Certain covenants will cease to apply to the Notes if, and for so long as, the
Notes have investment grade ratings from certain rating agencies and there
is no default or event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of
Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated
Investment Grade.”

**Transfer Restrictions ....................** The Issuer has not registered the Notes under the Securities Act, and the
Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. The Issuer
does not intend to issue registered notes under the Securities Act or any
state or other securities laws in exchange for the Notes to be privately
placed in this offering, and the absence of registration rights may adversely
impact the transferability of the Notes. For more information, see “Transfer
Restrictions.”

**Absence of Public Market for the**
**Notes ..............................................** Each series of Notes will be a new issue of securities and there is currently
no established trading market for any series of Notes. We cannot assure you
that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after
this offering.

The Notes will trade separately from the Existing Notes, will have a
different ISIN and CUSIP than the Existing Notes and will not be fungible
with the Existing Notes.

The Issuer does not intend to apply for a listing of the Dollar Notes on any
securities exchange or automated quotation system.

The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange
following the consummation of this offering. There is no assurance that the
Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if
listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the
Euro Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro
Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining
such listing or admission to trading. There can be no assurance as to the
development or liquidity of any market for any series of Notes.

Certain of the initial purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently
intend to make a market in the Notes. However, they are not obligated to do
so, and the ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes
may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements applicable to
the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect
to, the Notes. Any market making with respect to the Notes may be
discontinued without notice (including as a result of regulatory

45

developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under the
Exchange Act and its application to debt securities).

**Form and Denomination ..............** The Dollar Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum
denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof maintained in book-entry form and the Euro Notes will be issued in
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in
excess thereof maintained in book-entry form.

**Use of Proceeds .............................** We intend for the proceeds from this offering to be used as part of the
financing of the Acquisition, to fund the Refinancing and to pay fees,
commissions and expenses related to the Transactions. See “Use of
Proceeds.”

The summary historical consolidated financial information for the periods and dates indicated should be
read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
of Solenis,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Diversey”
and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this offering memorandum.

The consolidated statement of operations of Parent for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022,
September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of September 30, 2022 and
September 30, 2021 have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of
Parent for the year ended September 30, 2022, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, and should be read
in conjunction with those consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. Due to the impact of the Solenis
Acquisition by Parent on November 9, 2021, the audited consolidated financial information of Parent for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 2022 is presented in two distinct periods to indicate the application of a different basis of
accounting between the periods presented: (1) for periods prior to the Solenis Acquisition (October 1, 2021 through
November 8, 2021, labeled Predecessor) and (2) for periods after the Solenis Acquisition (November 9, 2021
through September 30, 2022, labeled Successor). This offering memorandum also includes the unaudited interim
condensed consolidated financial information of Parent for the three and six months ended March 31, 2023 and the
three months ended March 31, 2022, and the periods November 9, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and October 1, 2021 to
November 8, 2021, which has been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of
Parent as of and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2023 and the three months ended March 31, 2022,
and the periods November 9, 2021 to March 31, 2022, and October 1, 2021 to November 8, 2021. Due to the impact
of the Solenis Acquisition by Parent on November 9, 2021, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
information of Parent for the six months ended March 31, 2022 is presented in two distinct periods to indicate the
application of a different basis of accounting between the periods presented: (1) for periods prior to the Solenis
Acquisition (October 1, 2021 through November 8, 2021, labeled Predecessor) and (2) for periods after the Solenis
Acquisition (November 9, 2021 through March 31, 2022, labeled Successor). The unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information of Parent for the six months ended March 31, 2023 is presented at the level of
Parent, labeled Successor.

The consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss data of Diversey for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021 are derived from the audited annual consolidated financial statements of Diversey Holdings,
Ltd, included in this offering memorandum, and should be read in conjunction with those consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto. This offering memorandum also includes the unaudited interim condensed
consolidated financial information of Diversey for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022,
which has been derived from the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Diversey as of and for
the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022.

The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023 (“LTM Period”) gives effect to the Transactions, including the offering contemplated herein,
as if they had occurred as of April 1, 2022. The summary unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet
information as of March 31, 2023 gives effect to the Transactions, including the offering contemplated herein, as if
they had occurred on March 31, 2023. The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain
assumptions which we believe are reasonable. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial data is for
informational purposes only and does not purport to represent what our results of operations or financial positions
actually would be if the Transactions had occurred at any date, nor does such data purport to project the results of
operations for any future period. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information included in
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” has not been updated to reflect the actual
aggregate principal amount of the Notes, or the actual interest rates, sizing between the Dollar and Euro tranches or
exchange rates for the Notes. As a result, the pro forma combined interest expense, pro forma combined net income,
pro forma total liabilities and pro forma stockholders’ equity (deficit) amounts included herein have not been
updated to reflect the actual aggregate principal amount of the Notes or the actual interest rates, sizing between the
Dollar and Euro tranches or exchange rates of the Notes and may differ materially from actual amounts.

The financial data for the LTM Period of Parent has been derived by subtracting data from our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2022 from our audited consolidated

financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2022, and adding data from our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2023. These figures are not presented in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, but we believe they provide investors with useful information to assess our recent
performance.

The financial data for the LTM Period for Diversey has been derived by subtracting data from Diversey’s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2022 from Diversey’s
audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and adding data from Diversey’s
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These figures
are not presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but we believe they provide investors with useful information to
assess our recent performance.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively implement these operational initiatives and synergies.

**RISK FACTORS**

_Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks_
_described below and all of the information contained in this offering memorandum before deciding whether to invest_
_in the Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our_
_business operations. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations_
_would suffer and you could lose all or part of your original investment in the Notes. The risks discussed below also_
_include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these_
_forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Except where_
_noted or the context otherwise requires, as used in this “Risk Factors” section, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our_
_company” and “our business” refer to Solenis, Diversey and their respective subsidiaries on a pro forma combined_
_basis after giving effect to the Transactions._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Risks and impacts of the war in Ukraine on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows._**

The U.S. and global markets are currently experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of
geopolitical tensions and the ongoing war in Ukraine. In response to such invasion, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (“NATO”) deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe and the United States, the United
Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against
Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the
Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. The invasion of Ukraine
by Russia and the resulting measures that have been taken, and that could be taken in the future, by NATO, the
United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have created global security concerns
that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the severity and duration of the
ongoing war in Ukraine is impossible to predict, the active conflict could lead to market disruptions, including
significant and prolonged volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain
interruptions. Additionally, Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global
economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets.

We conduct operations in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such
sanctions could be expanded. If we fail to comply knowingly or unknowingly with sanction regimes or other similar
laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of licenses, or a cessation of operations,
as well as damage to our image and reputation. There is no guarantee that we will be able to quickly and completely
adapt our business model to changes that could result from these recent events, and any such changes may have an
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The effects of the war in Ukraine, resulting sanctions and any related market disruptions could be
substantial, particularly if current or new sanctions continue for an extended period of time or if geopolitical
tensions result in expanded military operations on a global scale. Most of the significant factors arising out of the
ongoing war in Ukraine are beyond our control and any such disruptions may also have the effect of heightening the
other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Although our business has not been materially impacted by the
war in Ukraine to date, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers, will
be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. If these
disruptions or other matters of global concern continue for an extended period of time, our business, financial
condition, operating results, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

**_Our cash and cash equivalents may be exposed to failure of our banking institutions._**

While we seek to minimize our exposure to third-party losses of our cash and cash equivalents, we hold our
balances in a number of large financial institutions, which are subject to the risk of failure. For example, on March
10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was unable to continue its operations and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”) was appointed as receiver for SVB and created the National Bank of Santa Clara to hold the
deposits of SVB. As of the date of this offering memorandum, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are
held with other large financial institutions, and we do not expect further developments with SVB to have a material

58


-----

impact on our cash and cash equivalents balance, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.
However, we regularly maintain cash balances with other financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit.
Therefore, if further failures in financial institutions occur where we hold deposits, we could experience additional
risk. Any such loss or limitation on our cash and cash equivalents would adversely affect our business, financial
condition, operating results and cash flows.

In addition, widespread investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result
in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and
operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more
difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our
cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses,
financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations
or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting
from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse
impacts on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by the current commodities market conditions and the current_**
**_inflationary environment as we face risks related to the volatile energy prices which could significantly disrupt_**
**_our operations, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, operating results, and_**
**_cash flows._**

We are closely monitoring the current price fluctuations in the commodities markets and in particular
natural gas, electricity, diesel and crude oil, as well as the current inflationary environment. The continuing increase
and volatility of gas prices may result in an increase of prices across our product lines, labor and other costs due to
market conditions including significant inflation, supply chain disruptions, transportation issues or raw material
shortages, among other challenges. Our exposure to these price fluctuations is not uniform and their impact may
vary between product lines and geographic regions. In the current inflationary environment, depending on the terms
of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of
inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. In addition, the rate of inflation may be impacted by
geopolitical events, including the current conflict in Ukraine and the implementation of sanctions related thereto,
that can cause the price of oil, gas and other commodities to increase, which can further increase supply and labor
costs. Although we have implemented a number of mitigation mechanisms, we cannot guarantee that these will
bring about the desired effect. Most of the significant factors arising out of the ongoing price volatility are beyond
our control and any such disruptions may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this “Risk
Factors” section. If these disruptions or other matters of global commodities markets concerns, such as potential
natural gas rationing to be implemented in Europe, continue for an extended period of time, our business, financial
condition, operating results, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by an epidemic, pandemic or any other public health crisis and we may_**
**_face risks related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, H7N9_**
**_influenza, H3N2 influenza and COVID-19 which could significantly disrupt our operations, customer demand,_**
**_and our suppliers’ ability to support us, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business, financial condition,_**
**_operating results, and cash flows._**

The widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable diseases, or any public health crisis that
results in economic or trade disruptions could negatively impact our business and the businesses of our customers.

Our results of operation may be affected by the impact on the global economy and businesses that COVID19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) has had to date or may have in the future. Global financial markets have
suffered downturns and volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may, as a result of the resurgence of
existing or the emergence of new COVID-19 strains (or similar outbreaks or pandemics), continue to have sustained
impact on businesses across the world. Such similar volatility and downturn could have an impact on the liquidity of
the Notes. Risks relating to COVID-19 and future pandemics or epidemics may become more expensive or
impossible to insure against. If any of the global impacts of COVID-19 resurge for a sustained period of time, and
should any of the risks identified above materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our performance.

59


-----

We are also susceptible to supply chain difficulties and are reliant on delivery of products to customers and
on delivery of materials from suppliers. If the supply chain becomes disrupted, or is delayed, as a result of a
COVID-19 resurgence, then this may have an impact on our performance. Additionally, any disruption in freight
may give rise to raw material and freight cost increases which may also impact our business. In addition, we may
experience higher costs in certain areas as a result of COVID-19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) such as
transportation and logistics, warehouse, and production employee compensation, as well as incremental costs
associated with health screenings and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees at our
facilities, which may be necessary in these or other areas. Any resurgence of COVID-19 may lead to further
deterioration of economic conditions, employment markets and/or equity markets and further disruptions to supply
chains, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance.

It is possible that a resurgence of COVID-19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) will cause an economic
slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. There is a significant degree of uncertainty and
lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such slowdown or recession. Given the significant economic
uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on
demand for our products. These expectations are subject to change without warning and investors are cautioned not
to place undue reliance on them. A resurgence of COVID-19 could result in a significant downturn in our end
markets and a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services, which could materially adversely
affect our business. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, any permanent increase in and
acceptance of remote and hybrid working arrangements may continue to adversely impact our revenues and business
model in our business and industry sector. There is the risk that certain mitigation and cost-saving initiatives to date
may not be sustainable or repeatable, or that the prolonged effects of COVID-19 may be different than what we have
experienced thus far, including permanent closures of client facilities or reductions in product and service offerings.

For example, economic uncertainty throughout 2022 was due to not only the COVID-19 pandemic, but also
the war in Ukraine, energy price rises and cost of living increases. Global economies have recorded low levels of
growth as they emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has been compounded with increased geo-political
uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine. These events if worsened may have a significant impact on the performance
on the business.

A resurgence of COVID-19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) could result in significant downturn in the
demand for our products and may lead to public health bodies imposing measures on the population that may impact
our ability to manufacture or impact our end markets. Any of these could increase the transportation costs of our raw
materials, result in a drop in demand for our products or services and adversely affect our business.

**_Uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

Uncertain or slowing global economic conditions, such as those currently present in the U.S. and
elsewhere, have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business as a result of weakened demand,
lower Net sales or profit margins, and unfavorable changes in product price/mix. Such conditions have had and may
continue to have an adverse impact on certain markets we serve (i.e., Graphic and Oil & Gas markets) where global
economic downturns can cause weakened demand. Conversely, other markets (i.e., Packaging and Tissue & Towel)
can see an uptick in demand in these phases of the cycle; however, there can be no assurance of this.

During economic downturns or recessions, there can be heightened competition for sales and increased
pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us. If we lose
significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly, then there could be a negative impact on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations, profitability and cash flows.

We depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business. Reduced availability of credit may also
adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital
expenditures. Instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets such as those likely to be caused by the
current environment of rising interest rates could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms
on which it might be available to us, our customers and our suppliers. This could negatively impact our ability to
obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers. This could
additionally result in reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable.

**_The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our_**
**_consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

We operate in 23 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as approximately
160 countries in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the
U.S. and a majority of our Net sales are generated outside of the U.S. These operations, particularly in developing
regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present in or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic
uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the
disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.

Risks inherent in our international operations include:

    - non-U.S. currency exchange controls and tax rates;

    - non-U.S. currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;

    - the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary
pressures;

    - restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection
matters, including anti-dumping duties, tariffs, embargoes, economic sanctions, and prohibitions or
restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;

    - changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade and foreign
investment;

    - the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain non-U.S. legal
systems;

    - variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;

    - more expansive legal rights of workers outside the U.S., unions, collective bargaining agreements or
works councils;

    - changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

    - import and export delays;

    - social plans and regulations that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;

    - the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and

    - unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against the countries in which we operate or
other interests.

In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from the various
jurisdictions in which we do business.

These and other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our international operations and
consequently, on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Fluctuations between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial_**
**_condition or results of operations._**

A significant portion of our Net sales during the year ended September 30, 2022 were generated outside the
United States. We translate sales and other results denominated in non-U.S. currency into U.S. dollars for our
consolidated combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, many of
our operations buy materials and incur expenses in a currency other than their functional currency. As a result, we

61


-----

are exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from our international operations and in translating our
financial results back to U.S. dollars. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales
and net income could be reduced because non-U.S. currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We cannot
predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results. As exchange rates vary, our results
of operations and profitability may be harmed. While we may use financial instruments to hedge certain non-U.S.
currency exposures, this does not insulate us completely from non-U.S. currency effects and exposes us to
counterparty credit risk for non-performance. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than
a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from non-U.S. currency variations. The gains or losses associated
with hedging activities may harm our results of operations.

In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern non-U.S.
investment, non-U.S. trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to
repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the U.S. and may limit our ability to convert non-U.S. currency cash
flows into U.S. dollars.

We have recognized foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in
Argentina in September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 as a result of the country being
designated as highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP.

**_Political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or_**
**_suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and cash flows._**

We have offices, factories and warehouses located across the world and we are exposed to risks inherent in
doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we, our customers, or suppliers operate, including: civil
unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage, epidemics, force majeure, war or other armed conflict and related government
actions, including sanctions/embargoes, the deprivation of contract rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses
required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or raw materials, the expropriation or
nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the movement of funds. As some of our
customers operate in the hospitality industry that supports both domestic and international tourism, their business
and indirectly ours, could be exposed to the negative consequences of travel pattern disruptions due to major
terrorist threats. Also, if additional restrictions on trade with China were adopted by the U.S., the European Union or
the United Nations, and were applicable to our products, we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in
the future. The impact of economic sanctions with respect to Russia and our business is discussed in “—Risks and
_impacts of the war in Ukraine on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.”_

**_Raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively_**
**_impact our results of operations, including our profit margins and Net sales._**

We use petrochemical-based raw materials to manufacture many of our products and oil-based materials
for our packaging. The prices for these raw materials are cyclical and are currently experiencing a prolonged period
of heightened prices due, in part, to the war in Ukraine, and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global
trade for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy could increase our costs. In addition, the prices of many of
the other key raw materials used in our businesses, such as caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates, surfactants,
polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances, are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are
beyond our control. Furthermore, the usage of certain chemical components used in the manufacturing of our
products, such as chemicals used in our surfactants, may be limited or restricted by government regulations, which
could restrict our sourcing options. If we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through
sourcing, pricing or other actions, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be
materially adversely affected.

Moreover, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to provide raw materials that meet our
specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules as well as all regulatory requirements. We seek to purchase
our principal raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts in order to ensure availability of such raw
materials. In some cases, there may only be a limited number of suitable suppliers available for certain raw
materials, which increases our dependence on parties that we have no control over. While alternative raw materials
may be available, these may be more expensive and not always compatible with our production processes.

62


-----

Natural disasters, as well as political instability, such as the war in Ukraine, and terrorist activities, may
negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers. These factors could lead to increased
prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers, which could
reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers, which could have a materially adverse
effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Environmental, social and governance, or ESG, issues, including those related to climate change and_**
**_sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of_**
**_operations and damage our reputation._**

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Increased
focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital
investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. In particular, customers, consumers, investors and
other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use,
deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. Changing consumer preferences may result in
increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic
packaging, and other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability; a growing
demand for natural or organic products and ingredients; or increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether
accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products.
These demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such
demands.

Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or
increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory
requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including disclosure requirements, or environmental
causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy, raw materials or compliance with emissions
standards, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs. Any
failure to achieve our ESG goals or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect
to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning
environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or
environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation.

If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder
expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for
ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from
another company or a competitor, and our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations may
be adversely affected.

**_Changes in customer demand could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes in our customers’ own
products or processes may enable them to reduce or eliminate consumption of the chemicals that we provide.
Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. A significant and
rapid decline in the use of certain chemicals, such as chemicals for packaging and board production, or in the
demand of customers’ products, such as certain paper qualities, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
particularly in the Consumer Solutions segment. Also increased awareness of and concern towards climate change
and more sustainable products may change customers’ demands, for example towards water treatment technologies
with lower chemical consumption, and this may have a negative effect particularly on the ability of the Industrial
Solutions segment to compete. Furthermore, if our products fail to perform in a manner consistent with quality
specifications or have a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could cease to use our products and services.
Customers in the food service, food and beverage processing, building care, lodging, industrial distribution and
healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years, and we believe this trend may continue. Such
consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain
customers. Any failure by us to be prepared to meet and manage these changed expectations could result in loss of
market share. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and future prospects.

**_Unfavorable consumer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and_**
**_earnings._**

From time to time, and especially in periods of rising raw material costs, such as the current period of high
inflation, we increase the prices of our products. Significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on,
among other factors, the pricing by competitors of similar products and the response by our customers to higher
prices. Such price increases may result in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and
adversely impact earnings.

**_If we do not develop new and innovative products or if such products are not accepted by customers in our_**
**_markets or fail to meet sales or margin expectations, our results could be negatively affected._**

Our products must be kept current to meet our customers’ needs, overcome competitive products, and meet
evolving regulatory requirements. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products
on an ongoing basis, and we invest significantly in the research and development of new products. If we do not
successfully develop innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors’
products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and results could suffer.

Our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely
manner at favorable margins. Maintaining this advantage is essential, especially in light of the reduction in barriers
for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers that e-commerce
permits. The development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of
investment. New products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including our inability to
(i) accurately predict demand, end-user preferences and evolving industry standards, (ii) resolve technical and
technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner or (iii) achieve manufacturing efficiencies.

**_Production interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition_**
**_and results of operations._**

Our revenues are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities. In particular,
the operation of chemical manufacturing plants involves many risks, including the breakdown, failure, or
substandard performance of equipment, natural disasters, power outages, the need to comply with directives of
government agencies, acts of terrorism, wars and dependence on the ability of railroads and other shippers to
transport raw materials and finished products in a timely manner. The occurrence of material operational problems,
or the loss of production assets, due to, among others, the foregoing events at one or more of our facilities could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.
Disruption to operations at any one of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, results of operations and future prospects. In addition, in certain circumstances, we could also be
materially and adversely affected by a disruption or closure of a customer’s plant or facility to which it supplies its
products.

**_We experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we_**
**_operate._**

Our products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types
of materials or products. We compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products, service, price and
innovations in technology. A number of competing U.S. and non-U.S. companies are well-established.

The market for our products is highly competitive. Our products face significant competition from global,
national, regional and local companies within some or all of our product lines in each sector that we serve.

Our inability to maintain a competitive advantage or to develop or implement appropriate competitive
strategies could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for our products or result in a shift in our product mix
from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, we may not successfully implement our pricing
actions. These factors may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or_**
**_those of third parties with which we do business, could have a materially adverse effect on our business,_**
**_consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

We rely to a large extent upon automation, software and infrastructure, both internally and with third
parties, to operate our business. The size and complexity of our information technology systems make them
increasingly vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack, which may pose a risk to the security
of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in
the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cybersecurity-attacks
or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities,
legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory
costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated
financial condition and results of operations. While we take reasonable measures to mitigate these risks, due to
continually evolving threats, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable
to advanced and persistent threats.

We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in some of our
businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls of the U.S., the European
Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or
information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be
vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to
the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software
solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective
products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could result in liabilities and penalties
and could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs and adversely affect our business and our results
of operations. Additionally, we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any
such failure.

The development of internet of things (“IoT”) (our sensors and analyzers that allow for the automation of
chemical treatment programs in complex industrial processes and our automated monitoring and feed systems for
treatment of commercial and residential pools and spas are all examples of internet of things applications) also
presents security, privacy and execution risks. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of
IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal
health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law or harm
individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may
increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our business and operating results.

Furthermore, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our failure to adhere to
or successfully implement appropriate responses in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our
brands’ reputations.

**_New and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Increased legislative and regulatory
activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied, could significantly impact our business
and the economy as a whole. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits and
other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. We may become involved in a number
of legal proceedings and audits, including government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort
and other litigation. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, and other contingencies could require
us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of
money, harming our financial condition. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be
necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, harming
our financial condition. There can be no assurance that any pending or future legal or regulatory proceedings and
audits will not harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

65


-----

Furthermore, the regulatory environment in which we operate is still developing, and the potential exists for
future legislation and regulations to be adopted. These developments may adversely affect the customers to whom,
and the markets into which, we sell our products, increase our costs, require additional expenditures to ensure
continued regulatory compliance and otherwise negatively affect our business, consolidated financial condition or
results of operations, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.

**_Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and non-_**
**_U.S. earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities._**

Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings
before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a
jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions
and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and
assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors (including changes in tax laws and
changes made by regulatory authorities), could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate.

**_We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of_**
**_these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the
international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer
pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our
companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any
applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or
characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax
treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Proposals by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) on international tax_**
**_reform may adversely affect our effective rate of tax in future periods._**

Changes in tax laws or tax rulings related thereto could affect our financial position and results of
operations. For example, various levels of government and international organizations such as the OECD and the
European Union are increasingly focused on tax reform. These efforts, such as the OECD/G20 Inclusive
Framework’s “Two Pillar Solution,” are designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of
their earnings. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework announced on July 1, 2021 broad agreement on the two pillars.
Pillar One addresses the broader challenge of a digitalized economy and focuses on the allocation of group profits
among taxing jurisdictions based on a market-based concept rather than historical “permanent establishment”
concepts. Pillar Two addresses the remaining Base Erosion and Profit Sharing risk of profit shifting to entities in low
tax jurisdictions by introducing a global minimum tax and a proposed tax on base eroding payments, which will
apply to multinational groups with revenues exceeding €750 million and would consist of a globally coordinated set
of rules, including an Income Inclusion Rule and an Undertaxed Payment Rule, which would operate with reference
to a minimum tax rate of at least 15% (determined on a country-by-country basis). However, the proposals have
been written broadly enough such that it is difficult to assess their overall effect. These tax reforms, or any other
changes in tax laws, could increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial results.

**_A major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and_**
**_telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition or results of_**
**_operations._**

If we experienced a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, winter storm, earthquake or other severe
weather event, or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood, at one of our larger strategic facilities or if
such an event affected a key supplier, our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication
resources, then there could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of

66


-----

operations. We are dependent on internal and third-party information technology networks and systems, including
the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information
technology infrastructure for fulfilling and invoicing customer orders, applying cash receipts, and placing purchase
orders with suppliers, making cash disbursements, and conducting digital marketing activities, data processing and
electronic communications among business locations.

We also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel, our
customers and our suppliers. Future system disruptions, security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt
our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a materially adverse effect on our
business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation_**
**_or the value of our brands._**

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our
business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions
could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of
our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. We could also be required to recall possibly
defective products, or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although
we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed
coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage.

**_If we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel, our consolidated financial condition or results of_**
**_operations may be adversely affected._**

Our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel.
Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us, and we need their expertise to execute our business
strategies. Our ability to recruit and retain our senior management, key personnel, and other skilled employees may
be affected as a result of the announcement of the Acquisition. If any of our senior management or other key
personnel cease to work for us, including as a result of the announcement of the Acquisition, and we are unable to
successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel, our business, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.

Some of our employees are represented by unions, workers’ councils or similar organizations and are
covered by collective bargaining or similar agreements that are subject to periodic renegotiation. Our employees
and/or these organizations may commence, in some circumstances, strikes or similar actions which may lead to the
disruption of the production process and consequent increase of costs and delay in delivery of our products. These
collective bargaining agreements are negotiated with various unions representing our employees.

In addition, in Europe and Latin America, most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or
workers’ councils and are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual
basis. As is the case with any negotiation, we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining
agreements, which could result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers. Renewal of collective bargaining
agreements could also result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. A disruption in operations or higher
ongoing labor costs could materially affect our business.

As a result, we will need to consult or negotiate with employee representatives on operational matters
concerning the organization of our labor force, salary inflation or other benefits and re-organizations, which may
lead to reduced flexibility in managing our operations and labor force to respond to opportunities, market changes or
cost challenges, and we may not be able to negotiate mutually acceptable new collective bargaining agreements,
which could result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, work stoppages or labor disputes that disrupt
operations which could materially affect our business.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of these
labor unions or workers’ councils for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could
have a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs, responding to market changes, and reorganizing or
restructuring our business. As is the case with any negotiation or consultation, we may not be able to negotiate

67


-----

mutually acceptable new collective bargaining agreements, which could result in delays, strained employee relations
and after escalation, potential strikes or work stoppages by affected workers, each of which could materially affect
our business.

**_We are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial_**
**_liability and increased operating costs._**

Our operations are subject to a number of federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental health and safety
laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacturing of our products, the discharge of pollutants
into the air, soil and water and the use handling, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.

Many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and
operations. Any failure to obtain, maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or
penalties, revocation or nonrenewal of our permits, or orders to cease certain operations, and may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We generate, use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. In the event our
operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment, we may become responsible for the
costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants, or sites where
we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, even if we fully complied with environmental
laws at the time of disposal. We have been, and may continue to be, responsible for the cost of remediation at some
locations.

Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration, labeling and sale of some of our
products. Throughout the world, such regulations continue to increase both in number and in stringency, resulting in,
among others, extra charges for single-use packaging in Europe, duplicative regulations as a result of Brexit,
regulatory-driven and customer-driven ingredient bans requiring reformulation, ingredient disclosure requirements
in the U.S., Asia and potentially Europe, and the incurrence of plastic levies under the European Union Multiannual
Financial Framework 2021 – 2027 and Recovery Fund, all of which create a risk of increased costs and a need to
modify our products.

We cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance, product
registration, or environmental remediation. Environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time.
Our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend
on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions. As a result of such
requirements, we may be subject to increased compliance costs, increasing risks and penalties associated with
violations, or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions, which may have a materially
adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our exposure to potential environmental liabilities is inherently uncertain, our existing indemnification_**
**_provisions may not cover all liabilities, and could be exacerbated by the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,_**
**_dissolution or other winding up of Ashland._**

Inherent uncertainties exist in our potential environmental liabilities primarily due to unknown conditions,
whether future claims may fall outside the scope of indemnification provisions, changing governmental regulations
and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies for handling site remediation and restoration.

Under the terms of the initial carve-out of the Solenis business from Ashland when it was acquired by
CD&R (as defined herein) in July 2014, Solenis UK International Limited is indemnified for certain pre-existing
environmental remediation costs. In the event of the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other
winding up of Ashland, we may stand to recover less than the indemnification provisions entitle us to or we may not
recover any amount at all.

In connection with the joint venture arrangement, whereby Solenis merged with P&W business of BASF in
January 2019, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis UK International Limited. During the
diligence process related to the acquisition, diligence was performed related to potential environmental liabilities. As

68


-----

of March 31, 2023, we did not have material contingent environmental obligations which are both probable and
estimable related to these production facilities or other real property acquired from BASF.

As of March 31, 2023, we have recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, which are
related to two environmental remediation matters. Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million is accrued liability
relating to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara,
Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million of accrued liability relates to potential exposure related to ground contamination
at our Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve of accrued liability for a potential exposure related to a
United States Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents
management’s best estimate of total expenses to be incurred.

There can be no guarantee that such indemnifications or reserves will be sufficient to cover any or all
environmental remediation costs or otherwise in connection with such matters. Environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations generally provide onerous requirements for companies that are found to be responsible for
violations, often irrespective of actual fault. As a result, we could be subject to future claims, investigations or
proceedings that may impose fines or remedial obligations, either in excess of existing indemnifications or reserves,
or in respect of future pollution, hazardous wastes or other environmental issues at the sites at which we own or
operate. In addition, we could be affected by business interruptions due to authorities closing entire facilities or parts
thereof.

If we become subject to one or more such environmental liabilities, this could have a negative impact on
our reputation as well as a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
connection with our existing indemnification, the possibility is considered remote that environmental remediation
costs will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements over the next 12 months.

**_Our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage_**
**_could adversely impact our business._**

Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and the use
of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we
believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all
liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury, death, or property damage arising in the
ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at
economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance,
we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_We may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws and any determination that we violated_**
**_these laws could have a materially adverse effect on our business._**

We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their agents from making
improper payments or offers of payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We conduct business in
countries and regions that are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Activities in
these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents
that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”).
We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents but we
cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts
committed by employees or agents. If our employees or agents violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate
record keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to
regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, or allegations of such acts, could damage
our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions in
which we operate and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and
nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees which could adversely
affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property,_**
**_we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a_**

69


-----

**_manner that capitalizes on our intellectual property, and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our_**
**_profitability and liquidity._**

Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the
proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. If we were unable to maintain the proprietary
nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products, this loss of a competitive
advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs, either of which could have a materially
adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

We rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position, including protecting the formulation and
manufacturing techniques of many of our products. As such, we have not sought U.S. or international patent
protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes. Accordingly, while we seek to
use our protected trade secrets to defend our continued right to sell products against those seeking to assert patents
on innovation that is similar to or competitive with our trade secrets, we may not be able to prevent others from
developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products.

We own, or have licenses to use a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products,
aspects thereof, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing. There is a risk that our owned and licensed
patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications.

We own, or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the
packaging, marketing, and distribution of our major products where our products are principally sold. Trademark
and trade name protection is important to our business. Although most of our trademarks are registered in the
countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. The costs
required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial.

We cannot be certain that we will be able to assert our intellectual property rights successfully in the future
or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Other parties may infringe on or misappropriate
our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace. In
addition, the laws of some non-U.S. countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as
the laws of the U.S. As a result, litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property, and such litigation
may be time-consuming and costly. We have been, and continue to be, in active intellectual property litigations.

While we take measures to protect our intellectual property and assert our intellectual property rights, we
cannot be certain that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products,
obtain information we regard as proprietary, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property
rights of ours. Any failure by us to protect our trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property
rights may have a materially adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected_**
**_costs or prevent us from selling our products._**

Many of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property that we must continually strive
to avoid infringing. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement,
misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could
result in substantial costs to and a diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our intellectual property
rights, including trade secrets, proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or
misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property
or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to
monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or
proprietary rights if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.

Although it is our policy and intention not to infringe valid patents of which we are aware and we conduct
patent clearance analyses to identify patents that our new products and services might infringe as well as make
necessary product or process changes to avoid infringement, we cannot provide assurances that our processes and
products and other activities do not and will not infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other
intellectual property rights belonging to others. Third parties have, from time to time, asserted intellectual property
70


-----

related claims against us, including claims for alleged patent infringement, and there is the continued risk that such
claims may be made against our products and services or our customers’ use of our products or services. We may
also be subject to indemnity claims by our business partners arising out of claims of their alleged infringement of the
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties in connection with their use of our products
and services. If we were to discover that any of our processes, technologies or products infringe on the valid
intellectual property rights of others, we might determine to obtain licenses from the owners of these rights or to
modify our processes or technologies or re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be
able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or be able to modify our processes or technologies or reengineer our products in a manner that is successful in avoiding infringement. Moreover, if we are sued for
infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the
infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from
selling our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on software from third parties, including open source software, and a failure to properly manage our use_**
**_of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue._**

Certain of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. Such third-party
software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source
licenses. We have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software. However, if we fail to
adequately manage our use of third-party software, then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims. In the case of open source software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses, the license itself, or a
court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source software, may require that parts of our proprietary
software code be publicly disclosed or licensed. This could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased
costs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of revenue.

**_Operations in emerging markets include risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

We have sales operations in 160 countries and manufacturing and lab operations in 23 countries, some of
which have political, economic and legal systems that are less predictable than in countries with more developed
institutional structures, including Brazil and China. Political or economic upheaval, changes in laws and other
factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these countries and, in turn, the amount of income
from, and the value of, the investments we have made, and may make in the future, in relation to its operations in
such countries. Operations in some emerging market countries also include the risk of the possibility of
expropriation or nationalization of assets. Also, the establishment or enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions
could effectively prevent us from receiving profits from, or from selling its investments in, these countries.

**_Our inability to consummate and effectively incorporate acquisitions into our business operations may adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations._**

We invest time and resources into carefully assessing opportunities for acquisitions, and we continue to
evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support, strengthen and grow our business, including potentially in the
near term. Despite diligence and integration planning, acquisitions still present certain risks, including the time and
economic costs of integrating an acquisition’s technology, control and financial systems, unforeseen liabilities, and
the difficulties in bringing together different work cultures and personnel. Although we have completed many
acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates, acquire possible
acquisition candidates, acquire such candidates on commercially reasonable terms, or integrate acquired businesses
successfully in the future. Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, from its execution until the Acquisition is
consummated or the Acquisition Agreement is terminated, without the consent of Parent, we may not acquire or
dispose of any other assets or business, other than acquisitions or dispositions of immaterial obsolete assets used in
the ordinary course of business. If the Acquisition is not consummated, we expect to continue to execute our
acquisition strategy; however future acquisitions may require us to incur additional debt and contingent liabilities,
which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and consolidated financial condition. The process of
integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in operating, contractual and supply chain
difficulties, such as the failure to retain customers or management personnel. Such difficulties may divert significant
financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations, and make it more difficult to achieve
our operating and strategic objectives.

71


-----

Additionally, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. Future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the obligations and liabilities of an acquired company may
not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of that company and the risk that those historical
financial statements may be based on assumptions that are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions or
approach to accounting policies. Any of these material obligations, liabilities or incorrect or inconsistent
assumptions could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

**_Social unrest may materially and adversely impact our business._**

Recently, there has been increasing social unrest throughout the United States and Europe (including
looting, protests, strikes and street demonstrations). We have many offices, factories and warehouses located across
the United States and Europe, and such social unrest could materially affect the ability of certain of these offices to
operate. Prolonged disruptions because of such social unrest in the markets in which we operate could disrupt our
relationships with customers, employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the case of our
corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection services.
Future civil insurrection, social unrest, protests, looting, strikes or street demonstrations may adversely affect our
reputation, business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may record future goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charges related to our reporting units,_**
**_which could materially adversely impact our results of operations._**

We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles asset balances for impairment during the fourth
quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment
may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for
impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated Net sales projections, growth rates, cash flows
and discount rates. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates
underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can
vary from actual results. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in
other key assumptions may result in future goodwill impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact
our results of operations.

**_Diversey has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting, and if its remediation_**
**_of such material weaknesses is not effective, or it fails to develop and maintain an effective system of disclosure_**
**_controls and internal control over financial reporting, its ability to produce timely and accurate financial_**
**_statements, or comply with applicable laws and regulations, could be impaired._**

In connection with the preparation of audited consolidated financial statements and related notes of
Diversey as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, a material weakness was identified in its internal control over financial reporting. A
“material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness that was identified was
related to the design and operation of controls related to inventory exercise and revenue recognition. These material
weaknesses arose because Diversey’s controls were not effectively designed, documented and maintained to ensure
the existence of inventory at certain locations and to address the timing of revenue recognition and the
completeness and accuracy of information used to estimate and accrue customer rebates.

To remedy the identified material weaknesses, Diversey is in the process of enhancing the design of
certain internal controls over the inventory and revenue process by:

    - enhancing controls to monitor the frequency and accuracy of cycle count procedures globally;

    - enhancing documentation associated with management review controls and validation of the
completeness and accuracy of key reports used across the inventory process;

    - enhancing controls over inventory existence for inventory located at third-party logistics providers;

72


-----

    - enhancing procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial data utilized in the
calculation of accrued customer rebates;

    - enhancing controls to monitor revenue cutoff risk based on the shipping terms in contracts with
customers; and

    - providing additional training related to validating the accuracy of data used in key review controls and
the level of documentation required.

Diversey will not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until these steps have been completed
and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time.

If Diversey is unable to further implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting
or disclosure controls and procedures, its ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and
to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject
Diversey to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses
and negatively affect investor confidence in its financial statements. If Diversey is unable to assert that its internal
control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm is unable to
express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, investors may
lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports.

Furthermore, Diversey cannot guarantee that the measures it has taken to date, and actions it may take in
the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in its internal
control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Diversey’s
current controls and any new controls that it develops may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in
its business. Further, weaknesses in Diversey’s disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may
be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in
their implementation or improvement could harm Diversey’s operating results or cause it to fail to meet its
reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of its financial statements for prior periods.

Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their
implementation or improvement could harm Diversey’s operating results or cause it to fail to meet its reporting
obligations and may result in a restatement of its financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and
maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect the results of periodic management
evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness
of Diversey’s internal control over financial reporting. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting could also cause investors and other parties to lose confidence in Diversey’s
reported consolidated financial statements and other information, which could have a negative effect on the
Acquisition, or its business and operations.

**Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Legacy Acquisitions**

**_Following the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition, we are controlled by Platinum. The interests of_**
**_Platinum, as equity holder, may conflict with yours as a creditor._**

Following the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition, Platinum controls Parent and, accordingly, will
have the ability to control our policies and operations. Platinum will not have any liability for any obligations under
the Notes, and its interests may not be aligned with your interests. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties
or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our equity holder might conflict with your interests as
a noteholder. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other
transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance its equity investments, even though such transactions might
involve risks to you as a noteholder. Furthermore, Platinum may in the future own equity or debt interests in entities
that directly or indirectly compete with us. Platinum also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be
complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. So long
as Platinum continues to beneficially own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less than 50%,
it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Because our equity securities are

73


-----

not registered under the securities laws of the United States or in any other jurisdiction and are not listed on any U.S.
securities exchange, we are not subject to any of the corporate governance requirements of U.S. securities authorities
or U.S. securities exchanges.

**_The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this offering memorandum may not be representative_**
**_of our results if the Acquisition is consummated, and accordingly, you have limited financial information on_**
**_which to evaluate our financial performance and your investment decision._**

The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have actually occurred had the Acquisition
been completed as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of our future operating results or financial position. The
_pro forma financial information does not reflect future non-recurring charges resulting from the Acquisition. The_
unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect future events that may occur after the Acquisition and
does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expenses. Certain adjustments and
assumptions have been made regarding the combined Solenis company consolidated under Parent after giving effect
to the Acquisition in the pro forma financial information included in this offering memorandum. Our assets and
liabilities have been measured at fair value based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that
management believes are reasonable utilizing information currently available. The process for estimating the fair
value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate
assumptions and estimates. These estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available and as
additional analyses are performed. Differences between preliminary estimates in the pro forma financial information
and the final acquisition accounting will occur and could have a material impact on the pro forma financial
information and the combined organization’s financial position and future results of operations.

In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be
accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the closing. The pro
_forma financial information has not been updated to reflect the actual size of the Notes offered hereby or the actual_
interest expense, sizing between the Dollar and Euro tranches or exchange rates with respect to the Notes, which
could differ materially. See “Risks Related to Our Business” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Information.”

**_We cannot assure you that our actual interest expense will not be materially higher than pro forma cash interest_**
**_expense as presented in this offering memorandum._**

In calculating our interest expense for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
data presented in this offering memorandum, we have made certain assumptions with respect to the interest rates
that would apply to the debt we will incur at the closing of the Transactions. These adjustments are set forth in
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” The actual interest rates on the debt we will
incur at the closing of the Transactions may differ materially from the assumed interest rates we have used in
preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, based on fluctuations in interest rates
and/or variability in actual amounts drawn on financing facilities.

**_Neither the Issuer nor Parent currently controls the acquired business and will not control the acquired business_**
**_until completion of the Acquisition._**

Although Diversey is subject to certain interim operating covenants in the Acquisition Agreement, we will
not control Diversey until completion of the Acquisition. Until that time, we cannot assure you that Diversey will be
operated in the same way that it would be operated if it had been owned by us during such period. The covenants in
the Indenture will not apply to Diversey until the consummation of the Acquisition.

**_We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro_**
**_Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions,_**

74


-----

**_Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and_**
**_Related Synergies)._**

We have made adjustments to EBITDA to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and
Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies). These
adjustments reflect certain items related to our business strategy, including the implementation of certain operational
improvement initiatives, as well as the closing of the Transactions.

For example, in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we have added back, among other things, (i) for Solenis,
the impact of non-recurring charges, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments related to the Legacy Acquisitions
and the Sigura Contribution, non-service costs for pensions and other non-operational items, one-time consulting
and transaction costs related to the Acquisition, management fees paid to Sponsor, realized and unrealized foreign
exchange gains/losses, as well as other non-recurring and unusual costs and, (ii) for Diversey, the impact of nonrecurring charges, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, non-service costs for pensions and other nonoperational items, one-time consulting and transaction costs related to the Acquisition, realized and unrealized
foreign exchange gains/losses, tax adjustments not related to income tax, factoring and securitization fees, COVID19 inventory charges, as well as other non-recurring and unusual costs.

Our ability to realize the expected benefit or cost savings associated with the adjustments included or
permitted by the Indenture and the Credit Agreements to be included when calculating Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA, including our adjustments for synergies identified in calculating Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), including $205 million of estimated run-rate annual cost
synergies from actions expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions as further described
in “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma
Financial Data,” depends on factors beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs,
competitors, customers delays in implementing initiatives, the incurrence of other unexpected costs associated with
operating our business, our ability to integrate businesses that we acquire and general economic or market
conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in generating growth, maintaining or increasing our
cash flows or profitability or achieving expected cost savings in connection with the items reflected in these
adjustments. Moreover, our continued implementation of these initiatives will cause us to incur additional costs and
may disrupt our operations and performance. Our estimated cost savings from these initiatives are based on several
assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will realize these cost
savings. If, for any reason, the benefits we realize are less than our estimates or our improvement initiatives
adversely affect our operations or cost more than we have projected or take longer to implement than we have
projected, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We
cannot assure you that Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies
and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) or Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies) will reflect the actual benefit of the related adjustments.

The prospective unaudited financial information contained in this offering memorandum was not prepared
with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information. The
prospective unaudited financial information included in this offering memorandum has been prepared by, and is the
responsibility of, Parent’s management. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, examined,
compiled nor applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the prospective unaudited financial information and,
accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect
thereto. The PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP report incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum relates to
Parent’s previously issued financial statements. It does not extend to the prospective unaudited financial information
and should not be read to do so.

**_Litigation may be filed that could prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions._**

The Issuer, Diversey or their respective affiliates, shareholders or boards of directors may be parties,
among others, to various claims and litigation related to the Transactions. Among other remedies, in certain cases,

75


-----

the plaintiffs in such matters may seek to enjoin the consummation of the Transactions. The results of complex legal
proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the consummation of the Transactions or divert the
attention of our management and employees from our day-to-day business, and otherwise adversely affect our
business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, litigation could be time consuming and expensive,
could divert management’s attention away from their regular business, and, if any potential lawsuit is adversely
resolved against Solenis, could have a material adverse impact on either of their business, financial condition and
results of operations.

One of the conditions to the consummation of the Transactions is that no law, order or injunction prohibits
the consummation of the Transactions. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any
potential lawsuit and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely
affecting our ability to consummate the Transactions on the terms contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, then
such injunctive or other relief may prevent the consummation of the Transactions in a timely manner or at all.

**_The closing of the Acquisition is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities._**

The completion of the Acquisition is subject to certain filing requirements, mandatory waiting periods
and/or receipt of necessary or advisable approvals, clearances or consents, as applicable, under the competition laws
of several jurisdictions. Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained,
we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, obtained at
all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional
conditions on the completion of the Acquisition, including the requirement to divest assets or require changes to the
terms of the Acquisition Agreement.

**_The anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than_**
**_expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations._**

The proposed Acquisition involves the integration of Solenis’ and Diversey’s operations, and there are
uncertainties and challenges inherent with this integration which may cause the anticipated benefits of the
Acquisition not being fully realized or taking longer to realize than expected. We will be required to devote
significant management attention and resources to integrating Solenis’ and Diversey’s operations. Delays or
unexpected difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Issues that must be addressed in integrating operations include, among other things:

    - conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation;

    - consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

    - consolidating sales and marketing operations;

    - retaining key employees;

    - retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;

    - identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;

    - minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns;

    - coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and

    - managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.

Even if we are able to integrate our operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization
of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings and operational efficiencies that we expect or the achievement of these
benefits within a reasonable period of time. In addition, Parent may have not discovered during the due diligence
process, and Parent may not discover prior to closing, all known and unknown factors regarding the Acquisition that
could produce unintended and unexpected consequences following the Acquisition. Undiscovered factors could

76


-----

result in us incurring financial liabilities, which could be material, and in us not achieving the expected benefits
from the Acquisition within our desired time frames, if at all.

**_Failure to retain our key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition._**

The success of the Acquisition will depend in part upon the retention of personnel critical to our businesses
due to, for example, their technical skills or management expertise. Employees may experience uncertainty about
their future roles until clear strategies are announced or executed. If we are unable to retain personnel that are
critical to our operations, we could experience disrupted operations, loss of customers, key information, expertise
and know-how, or unanticipated hiring and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the
anticipated benefits of the Acquisition that are actually achieved by us.

**_Uncertainty regarding the Acquisition may cause customers and suppliers to delay or defer decisions concerning_**
**_us and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

The Acquisition will occur only if stated conditions are met, many of which are outside our control, and we
cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied (or waived, if permitted by the Acquisition Agreement
and applicable law), and both Parent and Diversey have rights to terminate the Acquisition Agreement under
specified circumstances. In addition, the Acquisition may fail to close for other reasons. Accordingly, there may be
uncertainty regarding the completion of the Acquisition. This uncertainty may cause customers and suppliers to
delay or defer decisions concerning our products, which could negatively affect our business. Customers and
suppliers may also seek to change existing agreements with us as a result of the Acquisition. Any delay or deferral
of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, regardless
of whether the Acquisition is ultimately completed.

**_We have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in connection with the Acquisition, which may adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

We have incurred and expect to incur significant fees and expenses in connection with the Transaction, as
indicated under “Use of Proceeds,” which costs we cannot estimate accurately at this time. Consequently, we may
incur material charges in connection with the Acquisition, which may impact our financial results or cash flows.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to raise additional_**
**_capital to fund our operations, restrict our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to_**
**_interest rate risk and risk of default and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes and our other_**
**_indebtedness._**

After this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, we will have a significant amount of
indebtedness. As a result of our substantial indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred in connection with the
Transactions, a significant amount of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding
indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowings available
under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to fund our
other liquidity needs. As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would
have had total indebtedness of $7,305 million (excluding existing letters of credit, performance guarantees and local
lines of credit), including the Notes offered hereby, the Existing Notes and borrowings under the Term Loan
Facility, and we would have had unused commitments under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility available to us of
$640 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions our cash interest expense would have been approximately $469 million
based on the estimated blended effective interest rate utilized in the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Information.” This figure has not been updated to reflect the actual size of the Notes offered hereby or the
actual interest expense, sizing between the Dollar and Euro tranches or exchange rates with respect to the Notes,
which could differ materially.

In addition, although the terms of the Indenture will contain, and the terms of the Existing Indentures, the
Credit Agreements and our other debt instruments contain, restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur

77


-----

additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the
indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Further, these restrictions will not
prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. The more leveraged we become, the more
we, and in turn our security holders, will be exposed to risks related to our high level of debt. Our substantial
indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

    - limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, strategic initiatives, acquisitions or other purposes;

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other
indebtedness;

    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our
indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

    - make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;

    - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new
technologies or exploiting business opportunities;

    - cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings
under the Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;

    - impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;

    - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence
of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute an event of default under
the Indenture;

    - place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors and affecting our ability to
compete; and

    - increase our cost of borrowing.

In addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to
engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could
result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all of our
indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service all of our indebtedness, including_**
**_the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may_**
**_not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations, including the Notes, depends
on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive
conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be
able to maintain a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to
dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the Notes. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain loans or other debt financings on

commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our
scheduled debt service obligations. The Indenture will restrict, and the Existing Indentures and the Credit
Agreements restrict, our ability to dispose of certain assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions and may also
restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due.
Because of these restrictions, we may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an
amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.

Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business,
financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

Additionally, if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the
Notes and the Existing Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders
under the Credit Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan additional money to us, the lenders could
foreclose against the assets securing their respective borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or
liquidation. Any or all of these events could result in your losing all or a part of your investment in the Notes.

Further, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our most significant assets
are the equity interests that we directly and indirectly hold in our subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent upon
dividends, cash pooling and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our
outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends may be restricted by law, restrictions or taxes on
cash repatriation or in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the Existing Indentures, the Indenture,
the Credit Agreements or other agreements of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash
from operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

In addition, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Certain of our subsidiaries will not
become Guarantors. Unless they are Guarantors or guarantors of our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not
have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that
purpose. Further, we may be limited in our ability to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to us.
Subject to certain qualifications, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our indebtedness, including the
Indentures, to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict payments from those subsidiaries to us. We cannot
assure you that agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit those
subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient cash to fund principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including
the Notes.

**_Despite our level of indebtedness after the Transactions, we and our subsidiaries may still incur substantially_**
**_more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above and impair our_**
**_ability to operate our business._**

We and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the Indenture
will contain, and the Existing Indentures and the Credit Agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, including with
respect to our ability to incur additional senior secured debt. The additional indebtedness we may incur in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If we incur any additional secured indebtedness that ranks
equally with the Notes, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the Notes in any
proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up
of the Issuer or any Guarantor. This could reduce the amount of proceeds paid to you. These restrictions also will
not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness (including, among others, trade
payables and other expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business). In addition, as of March 31, 2023, on a pro
_forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the ABL Revolving Credit Facility would have provided for_
unused commitments of $640 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. See “Capitalization.”

Additionally, we have the option to raise incremental term loans or increase our commitments under the
Credit Agreements by certain amounts pursuant to the Credit Agreements. Such increases would be secured
indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase,
including the risk that we will be unable to repay the Notes. See “Description of Certain Indebtedness,” and
“Description of Notes.”

**_The Indenture will contain, and the Existing Indentures and the Credit Agreements contain, a number of_**
**_restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to_**
**_engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of_**
**_our subsidiaries to:_**

    - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

    - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;

    - make acquisitions, loans advances and other investments;

    - sell or otherwise transfer assets;

    - incur liens;

    - enter into agreements containing prohibitions affecting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

    - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:

    - limited in how we conduct our business;

    - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business
downturns; or

    - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions might hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategies. With respect to the
ABL Revolving Credit Facility, we are also required by a springing financial covenant to, on any date when
Adjusted Availability (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of (i) 10% of
the lesser of the Line Cap (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and (ii) $25.0 million, maintain a
minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:00 to 1:00, tested for the four fiscal quarter period ending on the last day
of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financials have been delivered, and at the end of each succeeding
fiscal quarter thereafter until the date on which Adjusted Availability has exceeded the greater of (x) 10% of the
Line Cap, and (y) $25.0 million for 30 consecutive calendar days. Our ability to meet the financial covenant could
be affected by events beyond our control.

A breach of the covenants under the Indenture, the Existing Indentures or under the Credit Agreements
could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may
allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to
an applicable cross-acceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under the Credit
Agreements would permit the lenders under the Credit Facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further
credit under the Credit Facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the
Credit Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness. In the event our
lenders or holders of the Notes or the Existing Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our
subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness.

**_The Ultimate Issuer’s accession to the Indenture and assumption of all of the obligations of the Escrow Issuer_**
**_with respect to the Notes may result in a taxable event for U.S. Holders._**

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts, which
will be released and used as part of the financing for the Acquisition and for the other purposes described further in
“Use of Proceeds.” In connection with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will merge with and
into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately continuing as the surviving entity and assuming the
obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. See “Description of Notes.” Although the issue
is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the transactions related to the Escrow Release of the
offering proceeds and the Escrow Merger should not result in a taxable event to holders for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. If this position is respected, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation would not recognize any
income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions. It is possible, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service (“IRS”) could take a contrary view and seek to treat such holders as exchanging the Notes for “new” Notes
in a deemed taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully asserted this position,
such holders would be required to recognize any gain or loss in connection with such exchange and would have a
new holding period and a new tax basis in the “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, such
“new” Notes may have original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“OID”). U.S. Holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the transactions related to
the Escrow Release of the offering proceeds and the Escrow Merger. For more information, see “Certain U.S.
Federal Income Tax Considerations—Effect of Escrow Release and Related Transactions.”

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, holders of the Notes may receive a lesser amount for their_**
**_claim than they would have been entitled to receive under the Indenture governing the Notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under Title 11 of the U.S. Code, as amended, modified
or supplemented, from time to time (the “Bankruptcy Code”) after the issuance of the Notes, the claim by any holder
of the Notes for the principal amount of the Notes may be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:

    - the original issue price for the Notes; and

    - that portion of any original issue discount that does not constitute “unmatured interest” for purposes of
the Bankruptcy Code.

Any original issue discount that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing may constitute
unmatured interest for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, holders of the Notes under these
circumstances may receive a lesser amount than they would be entitled to under the terms of the Indenture
governing the Notes, even if sufficient funds are available.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If
interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the
amount borrowed may remain the same, and our profit and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our
indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming that the ABL Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn and
that the applicable reference rate is positive, each one-eighth percentage point change in interest rates would result
in a change of approximately $4.2 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under the Credit Facilities.

In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate
interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, it is possible that we will not maintain interest
rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness. Alternatively, any swaps we enter into may not
fully or effectively mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_Claims of lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future indebtedness will have_**
**_priority over the claims of holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets that secure such_**
**_indebtedness, on a senior basis to the Notes._**

The Notes will be secured on a second-priority basis in the Current Asset Collateral. As such, the Notes
will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by a seniorpriority lien thereon, including our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the Current Asset
Collateral.

As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately $2,688 million of term loan borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, subject to
exchange rates, consisting of a $1,110 million Dollar tranche, a $300 million Dollar incremental tranche, a $750
million Dollar incremental tranche and a €500 million Euro tranche, and $60 million outstanding under the ABL
Revolving Credit Facility, which would have provided for unused commitments of $640 million, subject to
borrowing base capacity. In addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the
future, including additional secured indebtedness. See “Capitalization.”

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not_**
**_guarantee the Notes._**

From and after satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions and immediately following the
consummation of the Acquisition (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with or prior to this
offering), the Notes will be guaranteed by Parent and each of its existing and future wholly-owned domestic
restricted subsidiaries that is an obligor under our Term Loan Credit Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. Our
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay amounts due
under the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or
other payment. The Notes and the guarantees thereof will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other
obligations of any non-Guarantor subsidiary such that, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution or other winding up of any subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, all of that subsidiary’s creditors (including
trade creditors) would be entitled to payment in full out of that subsidiary’s assets before we would be entitled to
any payment from that subsidiary.

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries are co-borrowers or guarantors under our ABL Revolving Credit
Facility, which entities will not provide guarantees of the Notes. In addition, the Indenture will, subject to certain
limitations, permit non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any limitation on
the amount of certain other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these subsidiaries.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,
our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our Net sales and approximately 63% of our Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. As of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving
effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 60% of our total assets
(excluding intercompany receivables and investments in subsidiaries) and approximately 43% of our total liabilities
(excluding intercompany payables).

Further, our subsidiaries that provide, or will provide, guarantees of the Notes may be released from those
Notes guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events. If any subsidiary’s Notes guarantee is released, no holder of
the Notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including
trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be effectively senior
to the claim of any holders of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Note
Guarantees.”

**_The lenders under the Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the Guarantors under the Credit_**
**_Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those Guarantors to be released from their guarantees_**
**_of the Notes._**

While any obligations under the Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee may be released
without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the Trustee, if such Guarantor is no longer a borrower or

82


-----

guarantor of obligations under the Credit Facilities except by reason of payment under or the termination or
repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or if such release or discharge is by or as a result of payment in
connection with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description
of the Notes—Note Guarantees.” The lenders under the Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the
guarantees under the Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will not have a direct claim as a creditor
against any subsidiary that is no longer a Guarantor, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade
payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will be structurally senior to claims of holders of the
Notes.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the repurchase date. Additionally, under the Credit Agreements, a change of control, as defined in each of
the Credit Agreements, constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to, among other actions, accelerate the
maturity of any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facilities and terminate any commitments to lend. The
source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facilities would be
available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of
assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not
have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control and repay
our other indebtedness that will become due at such time. We may require additional financing from third parties to
fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. If we fail to
repurchase the Notes of any series in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture.

Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to
repurchase the Notes and events of default and potential breaches of each of the Credit Agreements, we may have to
avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

In addition, some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations or the sale of our
company to a public company that does not have a majority shareholder, may not, under the Indenture, constitute a
“change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those corporate events could
increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value
of the Notes. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indenture, we will be required to commence an asset
sale offer, as defined under the Indenture, pursuant to which we will be obligated to offer to purchase the applicable
Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See “Description of
Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

The exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require us to repurchase the Notes pursuant to a
change of control offer or asset sale offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other
indebtedness, including future agreements, even if the change of control or asset sale itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a change of control offer or asset sale is required to be made
at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain
such prohibitions. If we do not obtain consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing
the Notes. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the
Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, our ability to pay cash to
the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of “change of control” in the Indenture includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or
substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law and the judicial interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and
circumstances. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a
sale, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a

83


-----

whole, to another person or group is uncertain. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to
repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_The Issuer may redeem your Notes at any time, which may adversely affect your return._**

As described under “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption,” we have the right to redeem any series
of Notes in whole or in part beginning on June 1, 2025 at the applicable redemption prices set forth herein.

At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the Dollar
Notes with an amount equal to the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of      % of the
principal amount of the Dollar Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes then outstanding
and (y) $   million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes remains outstanding (except to the extent all Dollar
Notes are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture).

At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the Euro
Notes with an amount equal to the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of      % of the
principal amount of the Euro Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes then outstanding
and (y) €   million aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes remains outstanding (except to the extent all Euro
Notes are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture).

We may also redeem the remaining outstanding Notes of a series in whole or in part in connection with any
tender offer or other offer to purchase such series of Notes (including pursuant to a change of control or asset sale
offer under the Indenture), if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
purchased by the Issuer, or any third-party purchasing or acquiring the Notes in lieu of the Issuer, at the price paid to
holders in such purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Furthermore, at any time prior to June 1, 2025, we may
redeem up to 10% of the principal amount of each series of Notes during each calendar year at a redemption price
equal to 103% of the principal amount of such series of Notes being redeemed, plus accrued interest. We may
choose to exercise these redemption rights when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you may not
be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that of the
applicable series of Notes.

**_Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or the guarantees_**
**_thereof or the related security interests and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes._**

Fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws may apply to the issuance of the Notes and/or the incurrence of
the guarantees or the related security interests. Under the Bankruptcy Code and other fraudulent transfer or
conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Notes or the guarantees or
the related security interests could be avoided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or any or the
Guarantors, as applicable, (a) is determined to have issued the Notes and/or incurred the guarantees or the related
security interests with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably
equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the Notes and/or incurring the guarantees or the related
security interests and, in the case of clause (b) only, one or more of the following is also true at the time thereof:

    - the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the
issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees or the related security interests;

    - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees or the related security interests left the
Issuer or any of the Guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets
to carry on the business engaged in or contemplated;

    - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors intended to, or believed that the Issuer or such Guarantor would,
incur debts beyond the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or

84


-----

    - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a
judgment for money damages docketed against the Issuer or the Guarantor if, in either case, the
judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a
Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or the related security
interests to the extent the Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the
issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim
that, because the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor,
the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair
consideration. Therefore, if a court were to find that the applicable Guarantor were insolvent or rendered insolvent
by the incurrence of the guarantee or one of the other conditions above (relating to the Guarantor’s financial
condition) were satisfied, the court could avoid the obligations under the guarantees and the related security
interests, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of
the Notes, including requiring the return of prior payments thereon.

Courts in different jurisdictions may measure solvency differently, such that we cannot be certain as to the
standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantors were insolvent at the relevant
time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a Guarantor were
indeed insolvent on that date, that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not
constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds, or whether the Notes or any guarantees
would be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any of the Guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem
an entity insolvent if:

    - the sum of its debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, was greater than the fair value of
all of its assets;

    - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

    - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit a Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it
could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance. This provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect the guarantees from being
avoided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may reduce or eliminate the Guarantor’s obligation to an
amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee or the related security
interests was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the Notes or
that guarantee, could avoid the liens securing the Notes and the related guarantees, could subordinate the Notes or
that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the related Guarantor or could require
the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes, or may receive only a
partial repayment. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or the guarantees could result in an event of default with
respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.

In addition, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the Notes or by a Guarantor under a guarantee made at a
time the Issuer or such Guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to the
Issuer or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s creditors if such payment is
made to an “insider” within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other party, and
such payment would give the recipient thereof more than such party would have received in a distribution under the
Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case, subject to applicable defenses.

-----

Also, no assurance can be given that no party in interest would not challenge any of the transactions in
connection with the Acquisition as a fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise in any insolvency
proceedings, or what the outcome of any such challenge would be.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the
guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1)
the holder of the Notes or the guarantees engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct
resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the Notes and (3)
equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to each series of Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of such series of Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the
rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of
time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant, such as adverse changes in our business. A negative change in or an
indication of a possible negative change in any of our ratings could have an adverse effect on the trading and market
price of such series of Notes. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of any credit rating by one or more
of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings or result in
higher borrowing costs. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive
for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to a series of Notes is subsequently
lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell such Notes without a substantial discount.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our_**
**_future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital._**

Our debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis
of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our
credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the applicable series of Notes. Credit ratings are not
recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any series of Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the
potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of such Notes.

Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain
additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to a series of Notes is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell such Notes without a substantial discount.

**_The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply_**
**_with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply
with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of
the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are similar provisions in the
Indenture.

**_Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will not be applicable during any period when such series of_**
**_Notes are rated investment grade by Moody’s and S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is_**
**_continuing._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will not apply during any period when the Notes are
rated investment grade by Moody’s and S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under
the Indenture. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, incur debt and to enter into
certain other transactions. We cannot assure you that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they

86


-----

are rated investment grade, the Notes will maintain such ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would
allow us to engage in certain actions that would not have been permitted while these covenants were in force, which
actions may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, the effects of any such actions that
we take while these covenants are not in force will be permitted to remain in place even if the Notes are
subsequently downgraded below investment grade and the covenants are reinstated. Any subsequent lowering,
suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the
Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes_**
**_under U.S. federal or state securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes. The holders of the Notes
will not be entitled to require us to register the Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell
the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment
for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, we will not be subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and holders of Notes will
only be entitled to receive the information about us specified in “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—
Reports,” including the information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the Notes._**

Each series of Notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We
cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. The
Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation
system. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange following the consummation of this
offering. There is no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if
listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained. The Notes
will trade separately from the Existing Notes, will have a different ISIN and CUSIP than the Existing Notes and will
not be fungible with the Existing Notes. Certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they
intend to make a market in each series of Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the
initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in any series of Notes and, if commenced, may discontinue
their market-making activities at any time without notice.

Certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in each
series of Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. They are not obligated to do so, however, and the
ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in any series of Notes may be impacted by changes in any
regulatory requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to,
such series of Notes. Any market-making activities with respect to the Notes may be discontinued at any time
without any notice.

Therefore, an active market for any series of Notes may not develop or be maintained, which would
adversely affect the market price and liquidity of such series of Notes. In that case, the holders of such series of
Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price, if at all. If a trading market were
to develop, future trading prices of the Notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

    - the number of holders of Notes;

    - prevailing interest rates;

    - our operating performance and financial condition;

    - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them; and

    - the market for similar securities.

87


-----

Even if an active trading market for a series of Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will
continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for a series of Notes
may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the
prices at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our
performance and other factors.

In addition, recent regulatory actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Rule 15c2-11 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, may restrict the ability of brokers and dealers to publish
quotations on the Notes on any interdealer quotation system or other quotation medium after January 4, 2025, which
may materially affect the liquidity and trading prices for the Notes.

**_The Euro Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange, and_**
**_the Issuer is under no obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro Notes._**

Although the Issuer will seek to have the Euro Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange following
the consummation of this offering, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Euro Notes will become or remain listed on
the Official List of the Exchange. The Issuer is under no obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro Notes on the
Official List of Exchange and may cause the Euro Notes to be de-listed in its sole discretion. If the Issuer does not
obtain, or ceases to or maintain, such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, it may seek to obtain and maintain
the listing of the Euro Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will do so
and the Issuer is under no obligation to do so.

Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Euro Notes as a result of any listing, failure to be
approved for listing or the de-listing of the Euro Notes may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
sell the Euro Notes. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an
application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, therefore, will not be required to provide a_**
**_management report of our internal controls._**

Because we will not register the Notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not be subject to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness
of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Securities Act also requires public companies to have and maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the effectiveness of those
controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls).
We will not be required to comply with these requirements and therefore we might not have procedures comparable
to public companies.

Although we have developed and monitor our internal control over financial reporting, all internal controls
systems, no matter how well-designed, have inherent limitations. In the course of our internal controls evaluation,
we seek to identify data errors or control problems and to confirm that appropriate corrective action, including
process improvements, are being undertaken. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor
our internal controls over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary. Our intent in this regard is that
our internal controls over financial reporting will be maintained as dynamic systems that change (including with
improvements and correction) as conditions warrant. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. We cannot be certain that our internal control
systems will be adequate or effective in preventing fraud or human error in the future or that new deficiencies of a
material nature will not evolve and which we may be unable to correct. Any failure in the effectiveness of our
internal controls over financial reporting could have a material effect on our financial reporting or cause us to fail to
meet reporting obligations, which could negatively impair our ability to execute our business strategy and have an
adverse impact on the price of the Notes offered hereby.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being registered with the_**
**_SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were
registering this offering of the Notes with the SEC. In particular, this offering memorandum does not comply with
SEC requirements regarding the presentation of a ratio of earnings to fixed charges, does not contain certain
executive compensation information that would be required in a registered offering and adjusts certain non-GAAP
financial measures in a manner that may not be permitted in an SEC filing. See “—We may not achieve some or all
of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project
Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies)” and “Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” In addition, the pro forma financial information presented herein has not been
prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. See
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” We urge you to consider this factor in
connection with your evaluation of your investment in the Notes.

**_Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero or avoided or released under_**
**_certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._**

It is anticipated that the Notes will have the benefit of the guarantees of our direct parent and certain of our
subsidiaries. However, the guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that the Guarantors are permitted to
guarantee under applicable law (including under applicable fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws). As a result, a
Guarantor’s liability under a guarantee could be reduced (including to zero) depending on the limitations and other
requirements of applicable law and/or the amount of other obligations of such entity. Further, under certain
circumstances, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes or other applicable laws could
avoid the obligations under a guarantee, or subordinate the guarantee to other obligations of the Guarantor. See “—
Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or the guarantees
thereof or the related security interests and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” In
addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described
under “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.”

As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee could be materially reduced or eliminated depending
upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
granted by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds
the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that the validity and/or enforceability of a
particular entity’s guarantee may be challenged in the case of an insolvency of such entity and that the applicable
court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or avoided.

**_The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which are secured by_**
**_a portion of the same assets that will secure the Notes, together with any additional secured indebtedness_**
**_permitted to be secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, will be senior to the Notes to the_**
**_extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral securing such indebtedness on a first-, or otherwise senior-,_**
**_priority basis._**

Obligations of the borrowers under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer and the Guarantors are
secured, subject to certain limitations and exceptions and customary permitted liens, by a first-priority security
interest in the Current Asset Collateral. The Notes and related guarantees will be secured, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions and customary permitted liens, by a second-priority lien on all of such Current Asset
Collateral of the Issuer and the Guarantors of the Notes and will have a first-priority lien on all other assets of the
Issuer and the Guarantors comprising the Fixed Asset Collateral. Subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, the liens on the Current Asset Collateral held by the holders of the Notes will, therefore, be fully
subordinated to the liens on the Current Asset Collateral held by our creditors under the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility, together with any additional secured indebtedness permitted to be secured by the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility on a senior-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral securing such
indebtedness. Only when our obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, and all other permitted seniorpriority indebtedness that is secured by such Current Asset Collateral, are satisfied in full will the proceeds of such

89


-----

Current Asset Collateral be available, subject to other permitted liens, to satisfy obligations under the Notes and the
related guarantees. Consequently, the Notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to the
obligations of the Issuer, the other borrowers under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, and the Guarantors and all
other permitted first-priority secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral. In
addition, the Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness secured by a lien on the Current Asset
Collateral that ranks senior to or equally with the Notes. Any such indebtedness may further limit the recovery from
the realization of the value of the Current Asset Collateral available to satisfy holders of the Notes.

**_We will need to repay or refinance borrowings under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility prior to maturity of the_**
**_Notes. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon us._**

We expect that our ABL Revolving Credit Facility will mature prior to the maturity of the Notes offered
hereby. As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had $60
million outstanding under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, with $640 million of availability, subject to
borrowing base capacity. See “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Indebtedness.”

Consequently, prior to the maturity of the Notes, we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise
extend the maturity of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Our ability to repay, refinance, replace or extend will be
dependent on, among other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of the
financial markets. If a financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay, refinance or
replace indebtedness outstanding under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, we could be forced to undertake
alternate financings, negotiate for an extension of the maturity of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or sell assets
and delay capital expenditures in order to generate proceeds that could be used to repay indebtedness under the ABL
Revolving Credit Facility. We cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any such transaction on terms
that are commercially reasonable, on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our failure to repay, refinance, replace or
otherwise extend the maturity of the ABL Revolving Credit Facility could result in an event of default under the
Indenture and the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which could lead to an acceleration or repayment of substantially
all of our outstanding debt.

**_The Indenture governing the Notes will contain, and the Existing Indentures and the Credit Agreements_**
**_governing the Credit Facilities contain, cross default or cross acceleration provisions that may result in all of the_**
**_debt issued under the Indenture, the Existing Indentures and the Credit Agreements to become immediately due_**
**_and payable because of a default under an unrelated debt instrument._**

Our failure to comply with the obligations contained in the agreements governing any of our debt
instruments could result in an event of default under such instruments, which could result in the Notes, the Existing
Notes and the Credit Facilities (together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees) becoming immediately due
and payable. In such event, we would need to raise funds from alternative sources, which funds may not be available
to us on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Alternatively, such a default could require us to sell our assets
and otherwise curtail our operations in order to pay our creditors. These alternative measures could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows, which could cause us to
become bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise impair the ability of the subsidiaries of Parent to make cash available to
the Issuer by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of its
indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_The rights of holders of the Notes in the Current Asset Collateral may be adversely affected by the ABL_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement._**

Under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the Current Asset Collateral securing the
obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other
obligations permitted to be secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, will rank senior to the
liens on such Current Asset Collateral securing our and the guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the related
guarantees. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to be secured by the Current
Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis (including post-petition interest, fees and expenses, whether or not allowed
or allowable in any bankruptcy case), will be paid with the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral prior to the
obligations under the Notes and related guarantees in certain circumstances, including in the event of any

90


-----

foreclosure by the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event. The lenders under the
ABL Revolving Credit Facility, as holders of first-priority liens on the Current Asset Collateral, will (at all times
prior to the expiration of a 180-day standstill period which period would be extended if the lenders under the ABL
Revolving Credit Facility had commenced and were diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to all
or any material portion of the Current Asset Collateral or are stayed under applicable law from exercising such
rights and remedies) control substantially all enforcement matters related to such Current Asset Collateral, pursuant
to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the permitted first-priority liens on the Current
Asset Collateral, including under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, may cause the ABL Collateral Agent to
dispose of, release, or foreclose on, or take other actions with respect to, the Current Asset Collateral (including
certain amendments of and waivers under the security documents with respect thereto) with which holders of the
Notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the Notes, even after a default under the
Notes in the case of an enforcement action by the ABL Collateral Agent.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will (at all times prior to the expiration of a 180-day standstill period,
which may potentially be extended in the manner set forth above) prohibit parties with second-priority liens on the
Current Asset Collateral, including the holders of the Notes, from foreclosing on such collateral at any time prior to
the payment in full of the permitted obligations secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis,
including all obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent the Current Asset Collateral is
released from securing the obligations secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all
obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in certain
circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the agent under the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility or in connection with a sale or other disposition of the Current Asset Collateral permitted under the terms of
both the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture), the second-priority liens securing the Notes in the
Current Asset Collateral will automatically also be released. In addition, the Indenture and the security documents
related to the holders of Notes’ second-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral may not be amended in any
manner that contravenes the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Collateral
Agent and each other collateral agent party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted first-priority
lien on the Current Asset Collateral until such first-priority lien obligations are paid in full, and the ABL Revolving
Credit Facility and the security documents related to the first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral securing
the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreements without the consent of the Notes Collateral Agent. The ABL Intercreditor
Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the Notes would be required to turn
over to the holders of obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility amounts they receive from the Issuer
with respect to the Current Asset Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders
of the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of the
Current Asset Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the Notes after
payment in full of the obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the Current Asset Collateral, including all
obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—
Security—Intercreditor Arrangements.”

In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the ABL
Revolving Credit Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of Current Asset Collateral or our
obtaining debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing that is secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, the
holders of the Notes would (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their
liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) agree not to raise
objections to such use of cash collateral or DIP financing, and the holders of the Notes would also agree to having
their liens on the Current Asset Collateral be subordinated to the liens thereon securing such DIP financing or
providing adequate protection to the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. The ABL Intercreditor
Agreement will also limit the right of the holders of the Notes to raise various other objections or take various other
actions in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Current Asset Collateral prior to the payment
in full of the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, including, among other things, seeking relief
from the “automatic stay” with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, and will also place certain restrictions on
their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the Current Asset Collateral from a bankruptcy court,
even if such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were being affected.

91


-----

**_Even though the holders of the Notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral, the Term_**
**_Loan Collateral Agent will initially control actions with respect to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Collateral will also be subject to the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, among all holders of obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority
basis, including the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement, and subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, any actions
that may be taken with respect to the Collateral by any such holders, including the ability to cause the
commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the
exclusive direction of the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the date on which our obligations under
the Term Loan Credit Agreement (or any refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) are no longer secured pursuant
to the terms of the documents governing the Term Loan Credit Agreement or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of an
event of default under any agreement governing obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first priority
basis that constitutes the largest series of all obligations subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (solely to
the extent that such series of obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the obligations under our Term
Loan Credit Agreement then outstanding), is not stayed from pursuing any such exercise pursuant to the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement that is continuing and acceleration of such series of obligations, so long as the Term Loan
Collateral Agent has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or none of the Issuer or the
Guarantors is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to our Term Loan Credit Agreement, at which time
the parties to our Term Loan Credit Agreement will no longer have the exclusive right to direct the actions with
respect to the collateral securing the Notes pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct
such actions will pass to the collateral agent of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of
indebtedness secured by first priority liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral. Assuming that the holders of the Notes
represent the largest outstanding principal amount, if we issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the
lien securing the Notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the Notes or if the Existing Secured Notes
have a greater principal amount than the Notes, then the collateral agent for such additional indebtedness or the
Existing Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never
have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. In addition, under the terms
of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling fixed asset collateral agent forecloses upon
or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Notes on such
collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied
ratably among all the then outstanding first priority obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the Fixed Asset
Collateral). The Collateral so released will no longer secure our and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and
the guarantees. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy filing, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will impose
limitations on the holders of the Notes with respect to their rights to object to proposed DIP financing or the use of
cash collateral or to the liens securing such DIP financing that has been consented to by the lenders under the Term
Loan Credit Agreement and that satisfy certain terms and conditions.

Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Notes obtain
possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to
the discharge of each of the other obligations secured by first-priority liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral, then such
holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of such firstpriority obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the
controlling collateral agent under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, to be distributed (subject to
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral), in accordance with the provisions of
such agreement among all the holders of obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis.
See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents entered_**
**_into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to the creation_**
**_and priority of liens in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, will give it, in many cases, as a matter_**
**_of law, second priority to the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent and the_**
**_Term Loan Collateral Agent. In such cases, holders of the Notes will have to rely on the ABL Intercreditor_**

92


-----

**_Agreement and the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to obtain the benefit of senior priority liens on the Fixed_**
**_Asset Collateral subject to applicable law in such local jurisdictions, as the case may be._**

The lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents
entered into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to the creation
and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, will give it, in many cases, as a
matter of law, second-priority to the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral Agent and the
Term Loan Collateral Agent. As a result, the enforceability of the first-priority lien of the holders of the Notes with
respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral may be dependent on the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that the rights of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Fixed Asset
Collateral are secured on a first-priority basis and to which the ABL Collateral Agent, the Existing Notes Collateral
Agent and the Term Loan Collateral Agent, as applicable, will be a party.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes_**
**_and the other obligations secured by an equal and ratable lien on the Collateral or a senior lien on the Current_**
**_Asset Collateral._**

The Notes and the related guarantees will be secured, subject to certain limitations and exceptions and
customary permitted liens, by a second-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral of the Issuer and the guarantors
of the Notes and a first-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral. No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has
been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations
based on factors that include, among others, the condition of industries in which we operate, the ability to sell the
Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale
of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value
of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By their nature,
portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a
foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely, orderly or
value-maximizing manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to
pay our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, after first satisfying in full (from the Current Asset Collateral)
our obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility that are secured by a first-priority lien on the Current Asset
Collateral and after taking into account the pari passu obligations under our Term Loan Credit Agreement and the
Existing Secured Notes. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time (or at
all) in an orderly manner. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets
located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the
property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Notes
Collateral Agent acting for the benefit of itself, the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on the
Collateral. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes.
Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the
Collateral and any unpaid obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with any claim of all of
our other senior unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness and trade payables, against our and our Guarantors’
remaining assets. Moreover, the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and any other obligation secured by
_pari passu liens, such as the Existing Secured Notes, will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the_
holders of the Notes, thereby diluting the collateral coverage. The Collateral may also secure additional pari passu
indebtedness that we may incur in the future. Your rights to the Collateral would be further diluted by an increase in
the additional pari passu indebtedness secured by the Collateral.

In addition, as described further below, in the event that an insolvency or liquidation proceeding is
commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes and all other obligations that are secured by liens that are (as applicable) pari passu
with the liens on the Collateral securing the Notes or senior to the liens securing the Notes on the Current Asset
Collateral, the holders of the Notes would not be entitled to a claim for any interest, fees and expenses that accrued
on the Notes on or after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In addition, the holders of the Notes would not be
entitled to “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws with respect to any undersecured, deficiency portion
of the Notes existing as of the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding. See “—Rights of holders of Notes in
the Collateral may be adversely affected by United States bankruptcy proceedings and holders of the Notes may not
be entitled to post-petition interest, fees or expenses in any United States bankruptcy proceeding.”

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral and in_**
**_certain cases will cause the asset on which such liens are imposed to be excluded from the Collateral. There are_**
**_also certain other categories of property that are similarly excluded from the Collateral._**

The Collateral may be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the Indenture. The existence of any
permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral that could be realized by the holders of
the Notes as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. In addition, the
imposition of certain permitted liens may cause the relevant assets to become “excluded assets,” which will not
secure the Notes or the related guarantees.

In addition, the Indenture will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure purchase money indebtedness
and capital lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens may be automatically excluded from the Collateral
where the agreement governing such indebtedness or obligation prohibits the grant of a lien on such assets to the
Notes Collateral Agent. Our ability to incur purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations is subject to
limitations, as described in “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.” Other categories of excluded assets and property under the Indenture
include, among others, real property owned below a value threshold, certain future acquired owned real property
below a value threshold and leased real property, certain contracts, letter of credit rights and commercial tort claims
below a threshold and equity and assets of unrestricted subsidiaries and immaterial subsidiaries. See “Description of
Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Security—Collateral.” Excluded assets will not be available as Collateral to
secure our and the guarantors’ obligations under the Notes. As a result, with respect to the excluded assets, the Notes
and the related guarantees will effectively rank equally with any other unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and
the Guarantors that is not secured by the excluded assets.

**_Security interests over certain of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the Notes are issued._**
**_Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the granting or perfecting of such security interests_**
**_may impact the value of the Collateral. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the issuance of the_**
**_Notes increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests could be avoided in bankruptcy._**

Certain security interests in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent may not be in place by the time the Notes
are issued. To the extent any liens on or security interest in the Collateral are not perfected on or prior to the
issuance of the Notes, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests perfected
promptly following the issuance of the Notes and, in any event, within 90 days thereof. Additionally, certain filings
and other actions required for perfection of the liens on Collateral, prior to, on and after the date of the issuance of
the Notes may be delayed, or not completed at all, as a result of the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic,
including as a result of any applicable registration system, filing offices or related service not being available. Any
issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such security interests may
negatively impact the value of the Collateral. To the extent a security interest in certain of the Collateral is perfected
following the issuance of the Notes, any such security interest that is granted within 90 days (or in some cases,
potentially a year) of a bankruptcy filing would be at risk of being avoided or voided as a preferential transfer by the
pledgor, as debtor in possession, by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by our other creditors, which could
impact the value of the Collateral, even after the security interests perfected on the issuance date of the Notes were
no longer subject to such risk. If any such security interest is so avoided, you could also be required to return any
payments received on account thereof.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and guarantees thereof
will reveal any or all existing liens on such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens, could be
significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the Notes and guarantees thereof and could have an
adverse effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the
Notes and guarantees thereof.

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We believe we maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and
customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically

94


-----

insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete
or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured
obligations, including the Notes and the related guarantees. In the event of a total or partial loss to any of our
facilities, certain items of equipment may not be easily replaced.

**_We will in most cases have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the Notes and any future guarantees of the Notes._**

Subject to the terms of the Indenture, the Existing Secured Notes Indentures, the Credit Agreements, the
Intercreditor Agreements and the security documents governing the Collateral will allow us to remain in possession
of, retain exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral.
For example, so long as no default or event of default under the Indenture would result therefrom, we may, among
other things, without any release or consent by the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or otherwise disposing of Collateral
and making ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of indebtedness). See “Description of Notes.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral could be_**
**_released automatically without the consent of the holders of the Notes, which could be adverse to holders of the_**
**_Notes._**

Under various circumstances, all or a portion of the Collateral and the related Guarantors may be released,
including (among others):

    - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the
Indenture (other than to the Issuer or any guarantor), including the sale of any entity in its entirety that
owns or holds such Collateral;

    - with respect to Collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee;
and

    - pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements.

The guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor will be released in connection with a sale of such subsidiary
guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Indenture. The Indenture will also permit us to designate one or
more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Notes as an unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a
subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens in favor of the holders of the Notes on any
Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any guarantees of the Notes by such subsidiary or
any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Indenture. Designation as an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the
aggregate value of the Collateral to the extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its
subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a
senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries and the holders of the Notes will have
no claim to such assets. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Note Guarantees.”

**_If the guarantees are released as a result of the Notes having investment grade ratings from Moody’s and S&P_**
**_and there is no default or event of default under the Indenture, the Notes will no longer have the benefit of any_**
**_guarantees, unless the Notes subsequently have a lower than investment grade rating from either Moody’s or_**
**_S&P._**

If the guarantees are released as a result of the Notes having investment grade ratings from Moody’s and
S&P and there is no default or event of default under the Indenture, the Notes will no longer have the benefit of any
guarantees and no further guarantees will be granted and shall no longer have the benefit of the related Collateral of
such Guarantors, in each case unless the Notes subsequently have a lower than investment grade rating from either
Moody’s or S&P.

95


-----

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

Our obligations under the Notes are secured only by the Collateral described in this offering memorandum.
The ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the holders of Notes may be
subject to perfection, priority issues, state law requirements and practical problems associated with the realization of
the security interest or lien in the Collateral of the Notes Collateral Agent, including cure rights, foreclosing on the
Collateral within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws, obtaining third-party consents,
making additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of foreclosure. We cannot assure
you that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities will be given when required to
facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure on the Collateral will be
sufficient to make all payments on the Notes.

The holders of the Notes and the Trustee also may be limited in their ability to enforce a breach of the
“limitation on liens” covenant. Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a lender’s ability to accelerate
debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of certain junior liens or leasehold
estates, and a lender may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably necessary to protect against
impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default. Although the foregoing court
decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope of such preemption, if any, is
uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the Trustee and the holders of the Notes from declaring a default and
accelerating the Notes by reason of a breach of this covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the
ability of holders to enforce the covenant.

**_Rights of holders of the Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens on certain_**
**_Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through the taking of certain actions. The liens on the Collateral from time to time
owned by us securing obligations under the Notes may not be perfected if we have not taken the actions necessary to
perfect any of those liens. Our inability or failure to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected
security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection of the security
interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. In addition,
applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as
real property, and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and
identified. Furthermore, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral may not be in place on
the date that the Notes are issued. Although, under the Indenture and the security documents, the Issuer and the
Guarantors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to grant the security interest to the Notes Collateral
Agent, no assurance can be given that such security interest will be granted or perfected on a timely basis.

The Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will not be required to monitor, and we may not inform the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and
necessary action may not be taken by us to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral.
Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional
property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the
perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. Such failure may result in the loss of the
security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition,
as described further herein, even if liens on Collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may
potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any
future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee of the applicable Notes issued in the future might be avoidable in United
States bankruptcy proceedings.”

Additionally, the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the offering of the
Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of
the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee,
including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts. As a result of these
limitations, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, the Notes
Collateral Agent and the Trustee in a portion of the Collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be
subject to other liens) under applicable law. To the extent that a security interest in this Collateral is unperfected, in

96


-----

a bankruptcy the holders of the Notes may not have greater rights to such Collateral than would our general
unsecured creditors.

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee of the applicable Notes issued in the future might be avoidable_**
**_in United States bankruptcy proceedings._**

Any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, including pursuant to security
documents delivered after the issuance of the Notes, or any guarantees of any of the Notes issued in the future,
might be avoidable (as a preferential transfer or otherwise) by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in possession) or
by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by our other creditors) if certain events or circumstances exist or occur,
including (subject to any applicable defenses) if the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or
guarantee, the pledge or guarantee permits the holders of the applicable Notes to receive a greater recovery in a
hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation of the pledgor than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given, and a
bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or
issuance of the guarantee, or, in certain circumstances, one year. Thus, in any bankruptcy proceedings commenced
within 90 days of lien perfection (or potentially one year for any “insiders”) or the issuance of a guarantee, a lien
given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be
avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Acquisition Closing
Date (or within a 30-day statutory safe harbor). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy
protection after the Notes are issued and, in the case of the Notes, a lien granted after such date had been perfected,
or, in the case of the Notes, a guarantee issued, less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy
proceeding, such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the applicable Notes may be particularly subject to
challenge and avoidance as a result of having been delivered after the date on which the applicable series of Notes
were issued. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or a guarantee is avoided as a preference or
otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and could be required to return payments
previously received related thereto.

**_Rights of holders of Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by United States bankruptcy proceedings_**
**_and holders of the Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees or expenses in any United States_**
**_bankruptcy proceeding._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an
event of default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by bankruptcy law if bankruptcy
proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the Notes Collateral Agent has
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors, including the Notes Collateral
Agent, are prohibited from taking various actions in furtherance of debt collection, including repossessing their
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor or
any other collateral, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances
and/or could be materially delayed). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use
collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents, or profits of the collateral, even if the debtor
is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor with an interest in such
collateral is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the
circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral at
the time of the bankruptcy filing and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement
security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral
as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of
the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for
diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad
discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, as well as due to the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate
protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the
commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the
Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the
bankruptcy petition or at any relevant time thereafter or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be
compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate
protection” or otherwise.

-----

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreements will provide that so long as any obligations under the Credit
Agreements are outstanding, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the Notes will be subject to certain
restrictions with respect to their ability to object to various motions or seek other relief with respect to the Collateral
on a number of important matters. In particular, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also prohibit the holders of
the Notes from proposing, voting for, or otherwise directly or indirectly supporting any plan of reorganization or
similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, and the holders of the Notes may under certain circumstances be required to turn over
amounts and/or distributions they may receive in respect of the Current Asset Collateral to the holders of obligations
under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “—The rights of holders of the Notes in the Current Asset Collateral
may be adversely affected by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement.” Also, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will
impose limitations on the holders of the Notes with respect to their rights to object to proposed DIP financing or the
use of cash collateral that has been consented to by the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and that
satisfy certain terms and conditions. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Security—
Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a bankruptcy filing, the value of the
Collateral securing the Notes could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the Notes may be unable to raise
various objections or take other actions. The right of the holders of the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit
Facility to foreclose upon and sell the Current Asset Collateral or of the holders of the obligations under the Term
Loan Credit Agreement to foreclose upon and sell the Fixed Asset Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of
default also would be subject to limitations under applicable bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries
become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding.

Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient
to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other obligations that are secured by liens that
are either pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the Notes on the various components of the Collateral), the
holders of the Notes would have “undersecured deficiency claims” as to the difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do
not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees to the holders of
“undersecured claims” (or of unsecured claims) during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a
finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate
protection” under federal bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured, deficiency portion of the Notes. In
addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made prior to or at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal
amount of the Notes.

As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to limit the ability of the holders of the Notes to realize upon the
Collateral and to receive post-bankruptcy interest, fees, expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any
unsecured, deficiency portion of the Notes.

**_In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of_**
**_certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not_**
**_obtain the return you expect on the applicable series of Notes._**

This offering may not close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. In such case, the
Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the proceeds of this offering of each series of Notes into
separate segregated escrow accounts for the benefit of the holders of Notes of such series.

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to
be incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the
Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each series
of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in
an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase any Notes at a price greater than the issue
price of such notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Although we currently believe that all conditions to
the Acquisition will be satisfied and expect to consummate the Acquisition before the deadline for the special
mandatory redemption, we cannot assure you that the conditions will be satisfied or waived, that we will in fact
close the Acquisition on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum or that the Escrow Issuer

98


-----

will not otherwise have to redeem the Notes. Many of the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition are not within
our control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If for any reason we believe that the
Acquisition will not close before the deadline for a special mandatory redemption, we have the option to redeem the
Notes earlier on the same terms.

Additionally, the escrowed funds in the escrow accounts will be limited to the gross proceeds from this
offering of the Notes, together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash
to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory
redemption.

**_Purchasers of the Notes in this offering will not know, at the time they agree to purchase the Notes, whether or_**
**_not this offering will be funded into escrow._**

This offering is not conditioned on the consummation of the Acquisition, and there can be no assurance that
the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms described in this offering memorandum or at all. If the
Acquisition is not consummated substantially concurrently with the consummation of this offering, the gross
proceeds of this offering will be deposited into separate segregated escrow accounts on the Issue Date and will be
held as collateral security for the Escrow Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Notes during the escrow period.

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction
of a number of conditions precedent. The pricing of this offering of the Notes is expected to occur before we know
whether all conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition have been satisfied. As a result, purchasers of Notes
in this offering will not know, at the time they agree to purchase notes, whether or not this offering will be funded
into escrow.

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be obligations solely of the_**
**_Escrow Issuer until the consummation of the Acquisition._**

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the proceeds of the Notes are
deposited into the applicable escrow account, prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, holders of the Notes
will not have any recourse to Parent, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries, and the Notes will be the
obligations solely of the Escrow Issuer, secured by a first-priority security interest in the funds held in the applicable
escrow account. The Escrow Issuer is a limited purpose entity and does not hold or otherwise have any interest in
any material assets other than the applicable escrow account. As a result, the sole recourse of the holders prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition will be to the funds deposited in the applicable escrow account.

In addition, in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Escrow Issuer will be relying solely on the Equity Commitment
Letter under which the Ultimate Issuer or one of its affiliates will agree to transfer an amount in cash to the Escrow
Issuer sufficient to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders of the Notes.

**_Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, if the Escrow Issuer becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings,_**
**_the escrowed funds might be deemed to be property of the bankruptcy estate, and the holders of the Notes might_**
**_become unsecured creditors._**

If the Escrow Issuer commences a bankruptcy or reorganization case in the United States, or one is
commenced against the Escrow Issuer, U.S. bankruptcy law may prevent the Trustee under the Indenture from using
the escrowed funds to fund the special mandatory redemption. The court adjudicating the Escrow Issuer’s
bankruptcy or reorganization case might find that the escrowed funds are property of the Escrow Issuer’s bankruptcy
estate. If it makes such a determination, the court could authorize the use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate or
the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions, and the Trustee would be prohibited from
using or disposing of these funds. Although the Escrow Issuer will grant a first-priority lien on the escrowed funds
in favor of the Trustee and the holders of the applicable series of Notes, unless otherwise provided with protections
in connection with such use, the holders of the Notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate by
virtue of the Escrow Issuer utilizing the escrowed funds during the bankruptcy or reorganization case thereby
dissipating the collateral of the holders of the Notes. Under applicable bankruptcy law, creditors, including the
holders of the Notes while the funds are held in escrow, are prohibited from foreclosing upon or disposing of a

99


-----

debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). As a
result, the holders of the Notes may not be able to have the escrowed funds applied at the time or in the manner
contemplated by the Indenture and could suffer a loss. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special
Mandatory Redemption.”

In addition, even if the bankruptcy court recognizes that the holders of Notes are secured creditors with a
first-priority lien on the escrowed funds, it could nevertheless permit the use of the escrowed funds in exchange for
“adequate protection” of the holders’ interest in such funds. It is not clear what adequate protection, if any, the
bankruptcy court might require, but it is possible that the bankruptcy court could allow the use of the escrowed
funds and provide the holders with adequate protection that may not be as valuable as the escrowed funds, such as
replacement liens on different and less liquid collateral.

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, between the time of the issuance of the Notes_**
**_and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to modify or waive_**
**_the terms or conditions of such document without the consent of the holders of the Notes._**

The parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to amendments or waivers of, or consents to
departures or deviations from, the terms thereof, and holders of the Notes will not have the ability to veto any such
actions. The Escrow Agreement will not preclude the transaction parties from making such modifications or
waivers, and such modifications or waivers will not be made in consultation with the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the
initial purchasers or holders of the Notes. In addition, your decision to invest in the Notes will be made prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, and completion of the certain closing conditions stated in the Acquisition
Agreement, and consequently you will not be afforded protection with respect to changes in the business or financial
condition of the acquired business following the closing of this offering that would have a material adverse effect on
our business. Although no such amendment, waiver or consent is presently contemplated, if the parties to the
Acquisition Agreement decide to make changes to the terms thereof (including to the purchase price) or to waive
conditions thereunder, the holders of the Notes will not be able to prevent the release of the escrowed property to
fund the Acquisition as a result of any such action or object to any such amendment and will not have any veto or
consent rights in respect of any such actions.

**_If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied,_**
**_the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of default under the Indenture_**
**_has or would have occurred and is continuing._**

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow and utilized as described under “Use of Proceeds” upon
the Escrow Issuer’s delivery to the Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release
of the proceeds from escrow have been satisfied. The escrowed funds will be released from escrow even if a default
or event of default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing.

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition**

On March 8, 2023, Parent, Merger Sub and Diversey entered into the Acquisition Agreement, pursuant to
which Merger Sub will merge with and into Diversey, with Diversey surviving, following which Diversey will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Acquisition, Merger Sub will merge with and into
Diversey, with Diversey surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, each issued and outstanding
share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Diversey (other than dissenting shares) (the “Diversey
Common Stock”), will automatically be converted into the right to receive, in respect of shareholders other than
BCPE (the controlling shareholder of Diversey and an affiliate of Bain Capital), $8.40 per share, and, in respect of
BCPE $7.84 per share, in each case, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and BCPE will also
rollover a portion of its Diversey Common Stock into an affiliate of the Sponsor, and each share of Diversey
Common Stock will be cancelled, cease to be outstanding and cease to exist, and the Diversey shareholders will
cease to have any other rights with respect to their Diversey Common Stock. Parent will be deemed to be the
accounting acquirer for purposes of the Transactions.

The purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through:

    - proceeds of the Notes offered hereby;

    - borrowings under a new tranche of the Term Loan;

    - the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment; and

    - the New Equity Contribution.

For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” and “Description of Notes.”

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, among
others, (i) the affirmative vote in favor of adoption of the Acquisition Agreement by holders of at least two thirds of
the shares of Diversey Common Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, (ii) the expiration or early
termination of the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”), (iii)
the absence of any order of any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition
preventing the consummation of the Acquisition or enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Acquisition
that continues to be in effect, (iv) completion of any required information and/or consultation on procedures with a
labor organization, (v) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement), (vi) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Acquisition Agreement (subject
to certain materiality qualifications), (vii) compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the
Acquisition Agreement and (viii) obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right to terminate if the
Acquisition has not been consummated by the Outside Date. The Acquisition Agreement also contains customary
representations, warranties and covenants.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) of $2.8 billion and $352 million, respectively,
reflecting a 13% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

**_The Offering, Escrow and Escrow Release_**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior
to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will issue the Notes and deposit (or cause to be
deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series
of Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and

101


-----

investments therein. The Escrow Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Unless the Acquisition
closes substantially concurrently with, or prior to, this offering, substantially concurrently with the consummation of
the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will consummate the Escrow Merger, pursuant to which it will merge with and
into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately continuing as the surviving entity. Assuming the Escrow
Release Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will
become parties to the Indenture pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures, the Escrow Issuer will cease to
exist as a result of the Escrow Merger and the obligations under the Indenture will become obligations of the
Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors.

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release
Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of
default under the Indenture has or would have occurred and is continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to
be incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the
Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each series
of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect
on the applicable series of Notes.”

The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes, together with any
earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest
on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. The Ultimate Issuer or one of its
affiliates will issue the Equity Commitment Letter to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow
Agent and the holders of the Notes, to transfer to the Escrow Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and
expenses.

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see “Description
of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**_The Refinancing_**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, we will consummate the Refinancing using proceeds from the Notes, borrowings under a new
incremental tranche of the Term Loan Facility, the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment and the New Equity
Contribution.

**_The Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Issuer intends to borrow an incremental $750 million tranche under the Term Loan Facility and to
increase the available capacity under its ABL Revolving Credit Facility to provide for borrowings of up to $700
million, subject to borrowing base capacity.

102

**_New Equity Contribution and New Perpetual Preferred Equity_**

As part of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will fund a portion of the New Equity Contribution of
approximately $950 million in cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which will, through a series of transactions,
ultimately be contributed to Parent and which will be used as part of the consideration to be paid in connection with
the Acquisition. In addition as part of the Acquisition, BCPE will rollover: (i) approximately $617 million of its
existing equity interests in Diversey into common units in an indirect parent of Parent as part of the New Equity
Contribution; and (ii) approximately $438 million of its existing equity interests in Diversey into preferred units in
an indirect parent of Parent as the New Perpetual Preferred Equity, in each case, in satisfaction of a portion of the
consideration payable to BCPE under the Acquisition. From the Acquisition Closing Date until the first anniversary
thereof, Platinum or its affiliates may acquire the New Perpetual Preferred Equity from BCPE. Platinum may
exercise this option in its sole discretion following the closing of the Transactions.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions. The amounts and assumed sources set forth in the table and the accompanying footnotes may vary

adjustments and fees and expenses and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. If this offering closes prior to
the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds
from the sale of the Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, upon
the release of the funds from the escrow accounts, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby will be
used to fund a portion of the Transactions as set forth below. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Financial Information” and “The Transactions.” In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates
may be lenders under the Existing Diversey Credit Agreement and will be entitled to receive customary fees in
connection therewith and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to repay such
indebtedness. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be holders of the Existing
Diversey Notes and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to redeem such
indebtedness. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Note 1 — Description of the Transactions**

**Acquisition**

On March 8, 2023, Parent, Merger Sub and Diversey entered into the Acquisition Agreement, pursuant to
which Merger Sub will merge with and into Diversey, with Diversey surviving, following which Diversey will be a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. At the effective time of the Acquisition, each issued and outstanding share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share of Diversey (other than dissenting shares) (the “Diversey Common
Stock”), will automatically be converted into the right to receive, in respect of shareholders other than BCPE (the
controlling shareholder of Diversey and an affiliate of Bain Capital), $8.40 per share, and, in respect of BCPE $7.84
per share, in each case, without interest and less any applicable withholding taxes and BCPE will also rollover a
portion of its Diversey Common Stock into an affiliate of the Sponsor, and each share of Diversey Common Stock
will be cancelled, cease to be outstanding and cease to exist, and the Diversey shareholders will cease to have any
other rights with respect to their Diversey Common Stock. Parent will be deemed to be the accounting acquirer for
purposes of the Transactions.

The purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through:

    - proceeds of the Notes offered hereby;

    - borrowings under a new tranche of the Term Loan;

    - the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment; and

    - the New Equity Contribution.

For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” and “Description of Notes.”

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various customary closing conditions, including, among
others, (i) the affirmative vote in favor of adoption of the Acquisition Agreement by holders of at least two thirds of
the shares of Diversey Common Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote thereon, (ii) the expiration or early
termination of the waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”), (iii)
the absence of any order of any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal or regulatory restraint or prohibition
preventing the consummation of the Acquisition or enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Acquisition
that continues to be in effect, (iv) completion of any required information and/or consultation on procedures with a
labor organization, (v) the absence of a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement), (vi) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Acquisition Agreement (subject
to certain materiality qualifications), (vii) compliance with the covenants and agreements contained in the
Acquisition Agreement and (viii) obtaining certain specified regulatory approvals.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights, including the right to terminate if the
Acquisition has not been consummated by the Outside Date. The Acquisition Agreement also contains customary
representations, warranties and covenants.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey generated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA (After
the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) of $2.8 billion and $352 million, respectively,
reflecting a 13% Adjusted EBITDA margin.

**_The Offering, Escrow and Escrow Release_**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior
to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will issue the Notes and deposit (or cause to be
deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series
of Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and
investments therein. The Escrow Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Unless the Acquisition
closes substantially concurrently with, or prior to, this offering, substantially concurrently with the consummation of

112


-----

the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will consummate the Escrow Merger, pursuant to which it will merge with and
into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately continuing as the surviving entity. Assuming the Escrow
Release Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will
become parties to the Indenture pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures, the Escrow Issuer will cease to
exist as a result of the Escrow Merger and the obligations under the Indenture will become obligations of the
Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors.

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release
Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of
default under the Indenture has or would have occurred and is continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to
be incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the
Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each series
of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such
series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect
on the applicable series of Notes.”

The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes, together with any
earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest
on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. The Ultimate Issuer or one of its
affiliates will issue the Equity Commitment Letter to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow
Agent and the holders of the Notes, to transfer to the Escrow Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and
expenses.

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see “Description
of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**_The Refinancing_**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, we will consummate the Refinancing using proceeds from the Notes, borrowings under a new
incremental tranche of the Term Loan Facility, the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment and the New Equity
Contribution.

**_The Credit Facilities_**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Issuer intends to borrow an incremental $750 million tranche under the Term Loan Facility and to
increase the available capacity under its ABL Revolving Credit Facility to provide for borrowings of up to $700
million, subject to borrowing base capacity.

**_New Equity Contribution and New Perpetual Preferred Equity_**

As part of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will fund a portion of the New Equity Contribution of
approximately $950 million in cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which will, through a series of transactions,
ultimately be contributed to Parent and which will be used as part of the consideration to be paid in connection with
the Acquisition. In addition as part of the Acquisition, BCPE will rollover: (i) approximately $617 million of its
existing equity interests in Diversey into common units in an indirect parent of Parent as part of the New Equity
Contribution; and (ii) approximately $438 million of its existing equity interests in Diversey into preferred units in

113


-----

an indirect parent of Parent as the New Perpetual Preferred Equity, in each case, in satisfaction of a portion of the
consideration payable to BCPE under the Acquisition. From the Acquisition Closing Date until the first anniversary
thereof, Platinum or its affiliates may acquire the New Perpetual Preferred Equity from BCPE. Platinum may
exercise this option in its sole discretion following the closing of the Transactions.

**Note 2 — Basis of Presentation**

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information was prepared using the
acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805,
Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), and using the fair value concepts defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurement (“ASC 820”) and based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Solenis and Diversey.
Under ASC 805, all Solenis assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized and
measured at their assumed acquisition date fair value, while transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with
the business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of merger consideration over the fair value of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill.

The allocation of the purchase consideration for the Acquisition depends upon certain estimates and
assumptions, all of which are preliminary. The allocation of the purchase consideration has been made for the
purpose of developing the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. A final
determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed relating to the Acquisition could differ
materially from the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration. This final valuation will be based on the
actual net tangible and intangible assets of Solenis and Diversey existing at the acquisition date. Pursuant to the
terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is expected to close the month in which all the requisite closing
conditions have been satisfied. The final valuation may materially change the allocation of the purchase
consideration, which could materially affect the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a
material change to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.

The transaction accounting adjustments represent management’s best estimates and are based upon
currently available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information presented is for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been
realized if the Acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results
or financial position.

We have undertaken a preliminary review of both Solenis’ and Diversey’s accounting policies and did not
identify any significant adjustments that would be required to be made in order to conform the accounting policies
of the companies.

_discussed in the sections entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk_
_Factors.” We are not undertaking any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we_
_may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected_
_by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made._
_Therefore, you should not rely on these statements being current as of any time other than the date of this offering_
_memorandum._

_You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with_
_the sections entitled “Basis of Presentation,” “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial_
_Data,” “Risk Factors,” “The Transactions,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information”_

_September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 and as of September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023 and_
_March 31, 2022, Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries._

_The following discussion provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the_
_years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, and for the unaudited three and six_
_months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022._

_Parent, doing business as “Solenis” from November 9, 2021, is an exempted limited partnership registered_
_and domiciled under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Olympus and several other holding companies and_
_partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum, all of which are organized under Olympus Water Holdings I,_
_L.P., a Cayman exempted limited partnership (“Olympus I”) whose partners are entities affiliated with Platinum_
_and members of the Solenis management team._

_Parent was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the “Successor” entity for the specific purpose of_
_consummating Solenis Acquisition. The Solenis business was formerly owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC_
_(“CD&R”), BASF SE, and management. Parent also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of_
_receiving the Sigura Contribution. The Sigura business was formerly 100% owned by affiliates of Platinum and was_
_contributed to Parent immediately subsequent to the Solenis Acquisition on November 9, 2021._

_Parent was formed under a group of holding companies. Olympus I holds effectively 100% of the_
_partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings II, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership (“Olympus II”)._
_Olympus II holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings III, L.P. a Cayman_
_exempted limited partnership (“Olympus III”). Olympus III holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in_
_Parent. These holding companies and partnerships are collectively referred to as the “Holding Companies.” The_
_Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash, cash equivalents, certain related party_
_loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described_
_above._

_Upon the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition, Platinum acquired all of the capital stock and equity_
_interests of the entities comprising the legacy Solenis operations from Solenis UK Holdings Limited. Economic_
_control and legal ownership of the Solenis UK Holdings Limited and Solenis UK International Limited legal entities_
_were retained by CD&R and had no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents prior to the_
_Solenis Acquisition._

_Immediately following the Solenis Acquisition, the Sigura Contribution, which included all of Sigura’s_
_direct and indirect subsidiaries was contributed to Olympus I, and ultimately to the Issuer by affiliates of Platinum._
_Accordingly, the conclusion of the Solenis Acquisition and Sigura Contribution resulted in the consolidation of the_
_operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses (under the Solenis umbrella) from November 9, 2021 as_
_presented under the “Successor” periods._

_On September 9, 2022, Innovative Water Care Global Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the_
_Company) acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Clearon, an American producer and distributor of pool_
_treatment chemicals serving primarily the North American market. The purpose of the acquisition was to in-source_
_domestic production of specific intermediate materials critical to the development of our existing Pools business._
_Total consideration transferred at closing was $287.2 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, which_
_includes $50 million paid into escrow for contingent consideration to be earned by the sellers based on specific_

**Factors Affecting Our Operating Results**

The following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operation as well as factors
that impact those items:

**_Net sales_**

We generate revenue from the sale of products and services within each of the four geographic markets that
we serve. Our Net sales represents gross revenue net of estimates for returns and price allowances. Price allowances
are inclusive of discounts for prompt payment, customer specific rebates, continuous improvement rebates, and
other volume based incentives. Our overall Net sales are impacted by the following factors:

    - Fluctuations in overall economic activity within the geographic markets that we serve;

    - Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;

    - Changes in the prices charged for products and services;

    - Changes in the overall volume of customers served based on underlying fluctuations in supply and
demand;

    - Changes in the level of competition in the marketplace, either via price, or the launch of new products
by competitors;

    - Changes in the application or applied usage of our products and services; and

    - Sales and amortization of reverse supply agreements acquired as part of the acquisition of BASF Paper
& Water.

**_Cost of sales_**

Our Cost of sales consists primarily of the following:

    - _Materials and production costs: We purchase raw materials from a global network of suppliers to_
support the production of finished products and the delivery of services;

    - _Employee Costs: To retain the talent necessary to deliver high-quality products and services, we incur_
significant employee compensation and benefits costs. Payroll costs recognized via Cost of sales relate
specifically to those employees involved in the manufacturing process;

    - _Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and_
depreciated based on their estimated useful lives. Acquired property, plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets are recognized at their acquired fair values and amortized over their respective
useful lives. Assets specifically related to the production of goods and services such as an allocated
portion of costs incurred for our plant and buildings, and machine and equipment as well as
amortization expense relative to patents, process know-how and supply agreements are recognized via
_Cost of sales; and_

127


-----

    - _Other: Remaining Cost of sales relates to freight costs, warehousing expenses, costs associated with_
the idling of production facilities, product claims, or other general manufacturing costs.

Our overall Cost of sales is impacted by the following factors:

    - Changes in the price of raw materials, i.e. deflationary or inflationary price changes in the costs of
commodities;

    - Production volumes and utilization;

    - Improvement in production efficiency or other post-acquisition process improvements or cost savings
initiatives; and

    - Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

**_Selling, general and administrative expense_**

Our Selling, general and administrative expense consists of all expenditures incurred in connection with the
sales and marketing of our products and services, in addition to general and administrative costs, including:

    - Compensation and benefits costs for management, including stock-based compensation expenses;

    - Expenses relating to sales personnel primarily resulting from increases or decreases in sales volume or
to meet changes in anticipated demand;

    - Expenses related to support functions and executives;

    - Depreciation expense excluding that recognized via Cost of sales in addition to other general selling
expenses incurred in the normal course of business; and

    - Service cost on our pension and other post-employment benefit plans.

Changes in our Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales are primarily
driven by:

    - Variances in sales volume, as fixed costs can be spread to higher sales totals;

    - Changes in demand which can impact our determinations of budgeted costs necessary to both maintain
our customer base and increase our gross revenue on a constant currency basis;

    - Frequency and depth of product launches or entrances and exits into market or geographical segments;
and

    - Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

**_Research and development expense_**

Our Research and development expense represents costs incurred to develop new products or services, or
those incurred to develop and improve upon existing products or processes.

**_Amortization of intangibles_**

Amortization of intangibles represents the ratable recognition of expense relative to acquired definite-life
intangible assets that were initially recorded at fair value. This expense is exclusive of amortization recognized
through Cost of sales. Expense incurred and recognized via Amortization of intangibles primarily relates to assets
that are not directly related to revenue generating activities, i.e. customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames,
and land use rights.

128


-----

**_Restructuring and severance expense_**

Our Restructuring and severance expense relates to costs incurred for implemented reductions in force and
strategic restructuring decisions designed to reduce overall spend and better align the personnel and leadership with
our organizational structure.

**_Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets_**

We perform impairment assessments at least annually relative to any acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets, including in-process research and development assets. Additionally, we assess definite-lived
intangible assets for impairment to determine whether a qualitative or quantitative triggering event has occurred.

**_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_**

We continually seek opportunities to improve upon our market position and gain synergies via business
combinations. Acquisitions and transaction-related expenses represent costs incurred from completed, in-process, or
abandoned mergers and acquisition opportunities primarily for due diligence and valuation efforts.

**_Other operating (income) expense, net_**

We recognize Other operating (income) expense, net as a result of income and expense realized in the
ordinary course of our operations, but are not classified as expense types identified above. Examples include
realized foreign exchange gains on operational transactions and gains and losses on sales of property, plant, and
equipment, as well as bank fees and other financial costs.

**_Non-operating expense (income), net_**

We recognize Non-operating expense (income), net as a result of income and expense which arise from
transactions or other items which give rise to income or expense which are not in the ordinary course of our
operations. Such items include the following:

    - Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses;

    - Our share of income from our joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting net
of distributions;

    - Royalty income;

    - Pension expense (excluding Service cost, which is included in Selling, general and administrative
expense); and

    - Adjustments in the value of tax indemnification assets.

Other items which influence Non-operating expense (income), net include certain non-recurring items
which are not related to our operations such as:

    - Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts; and

    - Gains and losses on extinguishment of debt.

**_Interest expense_**

Interest expense primarily relates to costs incurred for interest expense on our external borrowings and
other long-term liabilities. Other elements included in interest expense include:

    - Amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with our external debt borrowings and
ABL Revolving Credit Facility;

    - Accretion of original issue discount on our external debt;

    - Interest expense on our note payable to our shareholders; and

129


-----

    - Reclassifications from Other comprehensive income related to our interest rate swaps.

**_Income tax provision_**

We are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Though the extent of our
future tax liabilities is uncertain, changes to our corporate structure, capitalization and future acquisitions are all
factors which may impact future book and taxable income of our subsidiaries and Parent as a whole. Our effective
tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide
range of tax rates, permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and local tax laws, and certain one-time items
including tax rate changes, benefit of non-U.S. taxes, and adjustments related to unremitted earnings of our
subsidiaries. The amortization and increased interest expense related to our acquisitions and capital structure reduces
our profit before tax to a level where the effective tax rate is highly sensitive.

**Results of Operations**

The information below represents our discussion of year-over-year trends in our Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations and are intended to supplement the information provided in the accompanying financial
statements and related notes included previously in these financial statements.

**_For the three months ended March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022_**

The information below represents our discussion of year-over-year trends in our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and is intended to supplement the information provided in the accompanying financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum (in thousands):

Income tax expense (benefit) ............................................................................ (2,482) 14,028

Net loss ............................................................................................................. $ (68,318) $ (279)

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by $59.5 million to $1.09 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 as
compared to Net sales of $1.03 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by the September 9, 2022 acquisition of Clearon and price increases to help offset inflationary raw
material costs. These increases were offset by declines in sales volume and unfavorable foreign currency effects.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by $46.9 million, to $836.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, as
compared to Cost of sales of $789.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. This increase was driven

130


-----

primarily by the September 9, 2022 acquisition of Clearon and incremental raw material inflation between periods.
These increases were offset by declines in sales volume and favorable foreign currency effects.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $4.8 million to $174.0 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $169.2 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2022. The overall increase in Selling, general and administrative expense was driven
primarily by incremental costs related to our September 9, 2022 acquisition of Clearon.

_Research and development expense_

Research and development expense increased by $1.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023,
as compared for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Research and development expense as a percentage of Net
sales was relatively consistent between periods.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $2.3 million to $31.8 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023, as compared to $29.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase in the
Amortization of intangible assets was primarily driven by incremental depreciation and amortization expense
resulting from the recognition of the purchase price allocation related to our September 9, 2022 acquisition of
Clearon.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses decreased by $0.9 million, to expense of $0.6 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. The
decrease was primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives related to planned reductions in force in
connection with the synergy objectives of the Solenis Acquisition, or in response to COVID-19.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $4.1 million to expense of $4.1 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $0 for the three
months ended March 31, 2022. This increase was specific to the deal costs incurred by Solenis to facilitate
acquisitions closed or contemplated during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating (income) expense, net decreased from an expense of $1.2 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2022 to income of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Fluctuations in Other
operating expense, net were primarily related to Realized foreign exchange gains and losses related to our
operations.

_Non-operating expense (income), net_

Non-operating expense (income), net, decreased from income of $31.8 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2022, to expense of $24.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This increase was
primarily related to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a portion of our third-party debt
is denominated in EUR and subject to foreign-exchange risk.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased by $26.5 million from $48.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022,
to $75.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The overall increase in interest expense was primarily
driven by impact of increasing market interest rates on our variable third-party debt and incremental external debt
related to the financing of our September 9, 2022 acquisition of Clearon.

_Income tax provision_

The income tax provision decreased by $16.5 million to a benefit of $2.5 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2023, as compared to expense of $14.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022. Our
income tax benefit and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of
income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax
laws, and certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted
earnings of subsidiaries.

compared to Cost of sales of $1.3 million for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022. This increase was
primarily driven by the six months of activity compared to the five months of activity in the comparable period
which impacted Cost of sales by $243.2 million. Further drivers were related to impact of raw material inflation,
volume decreases, the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and by sales mix, further
increasing Cost of sales.

March 31, 2023, as compared to $46.9 million for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022. The increase was
primarily driven by the six months of activity compared to the five months of activity in the comparable period.

_Impairment of intangible assets_

Impairment of intangible assets is driven by an impairment charge recorded during the three months ended
March 31, 2023 as a result of the abandonment of a research and development project previously capitalized as part
of the Solenis Acquisition as of November 9, 2021. No similar charges were recorded in the comparable periods.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses increased by $0.8 million, to expense of $1.3 million for the six
months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to expense of $0.6 million for the Successor Period ended March 31,
2022. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives related to planned reductions in
force in connection with the synergy objectives for Sigura.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses decreased by $39.6 million to expense of $6.7 million for the
six months ended March 31, 2023, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $46.4 million for

the closing of the Solenis Acquisition in the prior year which included bank success fees as well as legal and other
professional service fees incurred throughout the diligence process.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating expense, net decreased from an expense of $0.3 million for the Successor Period ended
March 31, 2022 to a benefit of $0.1 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023. Other operating expense, net

related to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a portion of our third-party debt is
denominated in EUR and subject to foreign-exchange risk.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased by $57.0 million from $88.3 million for the Successor Period ended March 31,
2022, to $145.3 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023. The overall increase in interest expense was
primarily driven by the impact of increasing market interest rates on our variable 3rd party debt, specifically related
to our Euro-denominated Term Loan.

_Income tax provision_

133


-----

The income tax benefit increased by $19.1 million to a benefit of $24.5 million for the six months ended
March 31, 2023, as compared to a benefit of $5.4 million for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022. Our
income tax benefit and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of
income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax
laws, and certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted
earnings of subsidiaries.

_Overview_

The following narrative compares eleven months of activity for the Successor period ended September 30,
2022 vs. the twelve months of activity for the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2021. The eleven month versus
twelve month comparison is driven by the timing of the Solenis Acquisition which closed on November 9, 2021.

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by $921.1 million to $3.91 billion for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022
as compared to Net sales of $2.99 billion for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Net sales was
driven by the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021. Net sales for the Sigura business during the eleven month
period ending September 30, 2022 were $692.2 million. Incremental Net sales on a fully comparative basis were
driven primarily by price increases to offset the impact of raw material inflation as well as increases in organically
generated volume.

_Cost of sales_

134


-----

Cost of sales increased by $900.1 million to $3.02 billion for the Successor period ended September 30,
2022, as compared to Cost of sales of $2.12 billion for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Cost of
sales driven by the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021. Cost of sales for the Sigura business during the
eleven month period ending September 30, 2021 were $463.8 million. Incremental Cost of sales on a fully
comparative basis were driven primarily by raw material cost increases as well as increases in organically generated
volume.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $89.9 million to $611.2 million for the Successor
period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $521.3 million for
the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense was driven
primarily by the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021, inclusive of realized cost synergies and the related costs
to realize those synergies. Incremental Selling, general and administrative expense on a fully comparative basis
were driven primarily by market based compensation increases for Solenis; legacy employees.

_Research and development expense_

Research and development expense increased by $3.8 million for the Successor period ended September
30, 2022, as compared for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Research and development expense
was driven primarily the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021 and the related research and development costs
required to support the legacy Pools business.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $65.0 million to $114.9 million for the Successor period
ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $49.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the
Amortization of intangible assets is primarily driven by incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting
from the recognition of the purchase price allocations specific to the Acquisition of the heritage Solenis business and
the Sigura Contribution.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $31.2 million to expense of $51.1 million for the
Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $19.9
million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase is specific to the deal costs incurred by Solenis (as
seller) and Parent (as buyer) to facilitate the closing of the Solenis Acquisition dated November 9, 2021 which
includes bank success fees as well as legal and other professional service fees incurred throughout the diligence
process.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating expense, net decreased from expense of $19.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2021 to expense of $9.7 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. Fluctuations in Other operating
expense, net were primarily related to Realized foreign exchange gains and losses related to our operations.

_Non-operating (income), net_

Non-operating (income), net, increased from income of $7.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2021, to income of $257.3 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. Incremental Non-operating
(income) was primarily driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates specific to our Euro-denominated
external debt which resulted in incremental income of $224.0 million between periods. Remaining net losses
incurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 driven primarily by the settlement of various monetary positions
in connection with the Acquisition and Contribution primarily offset net losses incurred during the year ended
September 30, 2021 driven primarily by the deconsolidation of our subsidiary in Trinidad and Tobago.

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased by $36.2 million driven primarily by incremental indebtedness utilized to
finance the Acquisition and Contribution, offset by net reductions in weighted average interest rates driven primarily
by fixed rate borrowings via the Secured and Unsecured Notes.

_Income tax provision_

The income tax provision increased by $41.0 million to $66.4 million for the Successor period ended
September 30, 2022, as compared to provision of $25.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our income
tax provision and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of income or
losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax laws, and
certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted earnings
of subsidiaries.

as compared to Net sales of $2,753.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by increases in sales volume (inclusive of acquisitions), the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and increases in pricing which increased Net sales by $106 million, $84 million and $48
million, respectively.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by $180.8 million, or 9.3%, to $2,120.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2021, as compared to Cost of sales of $1,939.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in Cost
of sales was primarily attributable to the impact of raw material inflation, incremental sales volume (inclusive
acquisitions) and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which increased Cost of sales by $66 million, $65
million and $63 million, respectively. These increases were primarily offset by changes in sales mix, which reduced
Cost of sales by $16 million.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $15.7 million, or 2.9%, to $521.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $537.0 million for
the year ended September 30, 2020. The overall decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense was driven
by permanent cost reduction programs actioned in 2020 which resulted in a net decrease in Selling, general and

136


-----

administrative expense of $41 million as well as the timing of expenses incurred for non-recurring costs which
reduced Selling, general and administrative expense by $6 million. These decreases were offset by fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, annual compensation cost increases and incremental incentive compensation
accruals which increased Selling, general and administrative expense by $12 million, $9 million, and $8 million,
respectively.

September 30, 2021, and 1.5% for the year ended September 30, 2020.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $1.9 million, or 4.0%, to $49.9 million for the year ended
September 30, 2021, as compared to $47.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in the
Amortization of intangible assets was primarily driven by the current year impact of our prior year acquisitions for
which we recognized amortizable “customer relationship” assets at each respective acquisition date.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses decreased by $15.8 million, to $5.4 million for the year ended
September 30, 2021, as compared to $21.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was
primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives related to planned reductions in force in connection
with the synergy objectives for the joint venture between Solenis and BASF or in response to COVID-19.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $17.7 million, or 791.4%, to expense of $19.9
million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the Solenis Acquisition and transaction-related
expenses of $2.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the timing
and relative size of our various acquisitions and contemplated actions.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating expense, net increased from $10.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 to $19.8
million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Fluctuations in Other operating expense, net were primarily related
to Realized foreign exchange gains and losses (including those on intercompany transactions), provisions for
indirect tax contingencies, bank fees and other financial costs, and losses on abandonment or sale of property, plant
and equipment.

The following table summarizes the components of Other operating expense, net for the years ended

_Non-operating expense (income), net_

Non-operating (income) expense, net, increased from expense of $87.1 million for the year ended
September 30, 2020, to income of $7.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily
driven by net unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on our Euro denominated debt (relative incremental net
gain of $117 million), offset primarily by the loss recognized as a result of the deconsolidation of our subsidiary in
Trinidad and Tobago ($17 million).

The following table summarizes the components of Non-operating expense (income), net for the years
ended September 30, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands):

2021, as compared to $182.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease in our Interest expense
was driven primarily by reductions in revolver borrowings outstanding and reductions in LIBOR rates on which our
First and Second Lien USD debt accrue interest. The net reduction in interest expense related to these items was
approximately $10 million, and $8 million, respectively.

_Income tax provision_

Income tax provision increased by $18.7 million, or 276.6%, to $25.5 million for the year ended September
30, 2021, as compared to $6.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Solenis UK International’s income
tax benefit and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of income or
losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax laws, and
certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted earnings
of subsidiaries.

**Non-GAAP Financial Metrics**

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following
non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA, Segment
profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows. We believe that the presentation of
these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that
these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by
excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We use certain of these financial
measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We
utilize Segment profit as the primary measure of our segment specific performance.

**_Reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Segment profit_**

EBITDA consists of net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment profit
consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items that are included in net income (loss) and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our
ongoing operating performance, and (iii) certain unusual or non-recurring items impacting results in a particular
period. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors with meaningful information to understand our
operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.

We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that
of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA and Segment profit may vary from that of others in our
industry. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to income before income taxes, net income
(loss), or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating
performance.

EBITDA and Segment profit have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in
isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

EBITDA and Segment profit:

    - Do not reflect the significant interest costs relative to our external debt;

    - Eliminate the impact of income taxes from the results of our operations;

    - Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Segment profit do not reflect
any expenditures for such replacements; and

143


-----

    - Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Segment profit differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Segment profit along with other comparative
tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S.
GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, and net income (loss) amongst other performance
metrics.

In evaluating these financial measures, readers should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses
similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Segment profit should not be
construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

The following table reconciles the pro forma adjusted Net income to pro forma EBITDA and pro forma
Segment profit calculations discussed above for all periods presented (in thousands):

(a) Represents costs incurred outside of our normal operations, primarily related to restructuring, severance and other synergy
initiatives;


(b) Represents non-cash purchase accounting adjustments unrelated to depreciation or amortization, primarily driven by the
amortization of fair value step-ups on acquired inventory and the write-off of deferred financing fees and original issue
discount in connection with the extinguishment of legacy indebtedness;

(c) Represents non-cash pension expenses driven primarily by the amortization of actuarial driven adjustments;

(d) Eliminates costs incurred relative to any potential or completed acquisitions, primarily related to due diligence efforts and
the valuation of acquired net assets;

(e) Relates to management and consulting fees pursuant to our respective management agreements with Platinum, CD&R and
BASF;

(f) Represents non-cash compensation expense related to equity and liability classified awards; and

(g) Relates to unrealized and realized foreign exchange (gains) losses recognized. These effects include gains and losses related
to our Euro denominated external debt, gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities settled in the normal course of our
operations, as well as losses incurred from hyperinflationary adjustments required by U.S. GAAP.

**_Reconciliation of Cash Flows_**

Adjusted net operating cash flows and Adjusted net investing cash flows consists of reported Net cash
(used in) provided by operating activities and Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, each adjusted for
the effects of cash subsequently received as part of our Accounts Receivable Facility. ASU 2016-15 requires us to
evaluate the transfer of title of receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Facility against cash received on
previously-sold receivables in exchange for the transfer of title. Since there is a dichotomy between when we legally
transfer title of receivables to ING Luxembourg S.A. (“ING”) or MUFG Bank, Ltd. (“MUFG”) under the ING
Receivables Purchasing Agreement or MUFG Receivables Purchasing Agreement, respectively, and when the cash
received on previously-sold receivables, receivables are deemed transferred in exchange for a beneficial interest in
the collection of that receivable. This is considered a non-cash investing activity. Furthermore, ultimate receipts of

144


-----

cash, when settled with ING or MUFG (as relevant), are considered cash flows from investing activities, as the
receipt is considered a return of capital on the beneficial interest.

We believe that this may cause Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and Net cash provided
by (used in) investing activities to be potentially misleading to investors. While we do not retain legal ownership of
the receivables sold, the nature, timing, and extent of cash flows have not materially changed as a result of the
agreement. We use these Non-GAAP metrics to assess our own liquidity.

The following table reconciles Net cash (used in) operating activities to Adjusted net operating cash flows

**_Liquidity and Capital Resources_**

We believe our ability to generate cash from operations and our access to capital markets will be sufficient
to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, acquisitions, debt maturities, and
other cash needs. Our liquidity needs are expected to be met through a variety of sources, including: Cash provided
by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, available credit lines, and long term debt markets. We believe that
our current financial position, liquidity, and credit ratings will provide sufficient access to capital when necessary.

The following is a summary of our cash position and total outstanding debt as of March 31, 2023 and
September 30, 2022 (in thousands):

_Operating Activities_

Adjusted net operating cash flow for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was a net cash outflow of $97.5
million, an increase of $176.6 million as compared to a net cash outflow of $274.2 million for the Successor Period
ended March 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of cash outflows associated with deal costs
and the settlement of other obligations required by the Solenis Acquisition.

The following table presents a rollforward of our net proceeds from the accounts receivable financing
facilities with ING and MUFG (in thousands). As part of the closing activities immediately prior to the closing of
the Solenis Acquisition on November 9, 2021, we repaid the outstanding initial purchase price due to MUFG of
$46.5 million. As of March 31, 2023, we have drawn $93.8 million under the Accounts Receivable Facility and have
an existing available capacity of $26.2 million. The rollforward is presented on a non-GAAP basis (in thousands).

As of March 31, 2023 ................................................................................................................................. $ 93,762

_Investing Activities_

Adjusted net investing cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was a use of $103.1 million, a decrease
of $4.8 billion as compared to a cash outflow of $4.9 billion for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022. This
decrease was primarily driven by the net cash paid by the Olympus entities to acquire the heritage Solenis business
for $4.9 billion on November 9, 2021.

_Financing Activities_

Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was an inflow
of $43.1 million as compared to an inflow of $5.4 billion for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022, a
decrease of $5.3 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by the net financing proceeds we obtained to facilitate
the Acquisition and Contribution on November 9, 2021.

_Effects of Currency Rate Changes on Cash_

The effect of currency rate changes on cash for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was an unfavorable
impact of $3.4 million, compared to a unfavorable impact of $1.3 million for the Successor Period ended March 31,
2022. This decrease was attributable to the relative appreciation and depreciation of the functional currencies of our
global operating entities relative to the U.S. dollar and the timing of cash movements during the respective periods
then ended.

**_Contractual Obligations and Scheduled Maturities_**

**Other Matters**

As of March 31, 2023, we do not have any unreserved contingent liabilities that management believes are
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash
flows, or liquidity. We have no material commitments outside our normal course of business. Additionally, there are
no relevant legal matters for which a loss is both probable, and estimable, for which we have not accrued as of
March 31, 2023.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS OF DIVERSEY**

_This management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information we believe is useful in_
_understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative and qualitative_
_information about key drivers behind revenue and earnings performance, including the impact of foreign currency,_
_acquisitions as well as changes in volume and pricing._

_The MD&A should be read together with our unaudited interim consolidated financial information for the_
_three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 and with our audited consolidated financial statements_
_and related notes as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, in each case, included_
_elsewhere in this offering memorandum, which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally_
_accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) (the “Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements”). The_
_statements in this MD&A regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity_
_and capital resources and other non-historical statements are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking_
_statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties_
_described in the “Risk Factors” and in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information.” Our_
_actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements._

_Unless otherwise indicated, references in this section to “we,” “us,” and “our,” refer to Diversey and its_
_consolidated subsidiaries._

**Overview**

We are a global leading provider of high-performance hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning solutions.
We develop mission-critical products, services and technologies that save lives and protect our environment. We
were formed as an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with limited liability on
November 3, 2020 for the purpose of completing an initial public offering of Diversey Common Stock and related
transactions and in order to carry on the business of our indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries.

**Reportable Segments**

We report our results of operations in two segments: Institutional and Food & Beverage.

    - **_Institutional - Our Institutional solutions are designed to enhance cleanliness, safety, environmental_**
sustainability, and efficiency for our customers. We offer a broad range of products, services,
solutions, equipment and machines, including infection prevention and personal care, products, floor
and building care chemicals, kitchen and mechanical warewash chemicals and machines, dosing and
dispensing equipment, and floor care machines. We also offer a range of engineering, consulting and
training services related to productivity management, water and energy management, and risk
management, supported by data provided through our digital solutions. We deliver these solutions to
customers in the healthcare, education, food service, retail and grocery, hospitality, and building
service contractors industries.

    - **_Food & Beverage - Our Food & Beverage products are designed to maximize the hygiene, safety, and_**
efficiency of our customers’ production and cleaning processes while minimizing their impact on the
natural resources they consume. We offer a broad range of products, solutions, equipment and
machines including chemical products, engineering and equipment solutions, knowledge-based
services, training through our Diversey Hygiene Academy, and water treatment. We deliver these
solutions to enhance food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability for customers in the
brewing, beverage, dairy, processed foods, pharmaceutical, and agriculture industries.

We evaluate the performance of each reportable segment based on the results of each segment. In addition,
corporate reflects indirect costs that support all segments, but are not allocated or monitored by segment
management, and include executive and administrative functions, finance and accounting, procurement, information
technology and human resources. For additional information regarding key factors and measures used to evaluate
our business, see “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “—Net Sales by Segment.”

**Recent Trends and Events**

**_Russia-Ukraine War_**

The geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe intensified on February 24, 2022 with Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine. The war between the two countries continues to evolve as military activity proceeds and additional
economic sanctions are imposed on Russia by numerous countries throughout the world. In addition to the human
toll and impact of the war locally in Russia, Ukraine, and neighboring countries that conduct business with their
counterparties, the war is increasingly affecting economic and global financial markets and exacerbating ongoing
economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption.

The Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated the current inflationary environment both in Russia, as a result of
economic sanctions that devalue its currency, and in other countries as their businesses and currencies react to the
war’s implications worldwide. It is possible that foreign currency restrictions or the development of multiple
exchange rates could arise in certain countries. In addition, if there are inflationary pressures in Russia and the
neighboring countries, we may be required to assess whether the economies of those countries have become highly
inflationary, in which the U.S. dollar would replace the Russian ruble as the functional currency for our subsidiaries
in Russia.

Our businesses in Russia and Ukraine generate an immaterial percentage of our overall Net sales.

**_Supply Chain Disruptions_**

The COVID-19 pandemic had a meaningful impact on our business, especially within our Institutional
segment. As economies around the world reopened, increases in demand created significant disruptions to the global
supply chain during 2022, which affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs.
These supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors, including changes in supply
and demand, industry capacity constraints, raw material shortages and labor shortages. Global logistics network
challenges have resulted in delays, shortages of certain materials, and increased transportation costs. We have
materially mitigated to date the impact of these disruptions through the work of our procurement and supply chain
teams, but there continues to be significant uncertainties regarding the future impact of supply chain disruptions,
which we cannot predict. Additionally, we continue the process of consolidating certain facilities within North
America, which includes opening a new manufacturing and warehousing facility, which have presented short-term
operational challenges and supply chain disruptions.

We are a diversified business in regards to both industry segments and global geographic regions. These
different aspects of our business are each impacted differently by supply chain disruptions and broader economic
conditions. Therefore, the recovery cycle and related timing is also different for each segment and region.

**_Capital Investments_**

On February 21, 2023, we acquired NSS Enterprise, Inc., a manufacturer of floor cleaning machines based
in the United States. This acquisition will enable the onshore assembly of floor cleaning machines in North America,
which we expect will significantly improve our scale, presence and support in the marketplace.

**_Impact of Inflation_**

Inflation affects our manufacturing, distribution and operating costs. We experienced unprecedented
inflation in 2022, which impacted the cost of our raw materials, packaging and transportation. Cost estimates for our
restructuring project in North America and Europe have also been impacted by the inflationary macro environment
with constraints around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary short-term measures were taken to minimize
disruption to customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily setting up additional
warehouses, paying higher freight costs during warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery.
Inflation declined slightly in the first quarter of 2023, but continues to be well above historical levels. We are
committed to maintaining our margins, and have taken actions to mitigate inflation through price increases, cost
control, raw material substitutions, and more efficient logistics practices. However, our success is dependent on
competitive pressures and market conditions, and we cannot guarantee the negative impacts of inflation can be fully
recovered. In periods of significant inflation, we may experience a lag between our ability to recover both the cost
and margin in the short term.

-----

**_Financial Market Volatility_**

In the first quarter of 2023, the U.S. and global banking sector experienced increased volatility as a result of
several distressed or closed banks and financial institutions. While we have not realized any losses as a result of the
increased financial market volatility, we continue to monitor the situation and will take appropriate measures, as
necessary, to minimize potential risk exposure to our customers’ and our cash and investment balances.

**Other Factors Affecting Our Operating Results**

Our operating results have been, and will likely continue to be, affected by numerous factors, including the
increasing worldwide demand for our products and services, increasing regulatory compliance costs,
macroeconomic and political conditions, the introduction of new and upgraded products, recent acquisitions and
foreign currency exchange rates. Each of these factors is briefly discussed below.

**_Increasing Demand for Our Products and Services_**

Governmental regulations for food safety and disease control, and consumer focus on hygiene and
cleanliness have increased significantly across the world in recent years. Climate change, water scarcity and
environmental concerns have combined to create further demand for products, services and solutions designed to
minimize waste and support broader sustainability. In addition, many of our customers require tailored cleaning
solutions that can assist in reducing labor, energy, water-use and the costs related to cleaning, sanitation and hygiene
activities. We help our customers realize efficiencies throughout the operation of their facilities by developing
customized solutions. We believe that our value-added customer service approach and proven commitment to
providing cost-savings and sustainable solutions position us well to address these and other critical demand drivers
in order to drive revenue growth.

**_Increasing Regulatory Compliance Costs_**

Although our industry has always been highly regulated, it is becoming more regulated with the
introduction of, among other things, the Environmental Protection Agency Biocidal Product Regulation and the
Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals. Compliance costs associated with these
new regulations have impacted our cost of doing business, and we expect these regulations and other existing and
new regulations to continue to affect our cost of doing business in the future.

**_Impact of Currency Fluctuations_**

We have significant international operations with 82.2% of our Net sales for the three months ended March
31, 2023, being generated from sales to customers located outside of the United States. Our international operations
are subject to changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures.

We present the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements in U.S. dollars. As a result, we must translate
the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all of our operations into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates.
Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the value of these items with respect
to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not
changed in their local currency. A stronger U.S. dollar reduces the relative value of reported results of non-U.S.
dollar operations, and, conversely, a weaker U.S. dollar increases the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar
operations. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods
and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. During
2022, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro and other European currencies, peaking in the third
quarter. The U.S. dollar has since trended weaker, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a
significant impact on our reported results in the first quarter of 2023.

In addition, many of our operations buy materials and incur expenses in a currency other than their
functional currency. As a result, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations
because we are generally unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses incurred in the
same currency. From time to time, as and when we determine it is appropriate and advisable to do so, we may seek
to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments.

**_Argentina_**

Argentina has been designated a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP effective July 1, 2018, and
the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. For more
information, see “—Foreign currency gain related to hyperinflationary subsidiaries” below.

**_Turkey_**

Turkey has been designated a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP effective April 1, 2022, and
the U.S. dollar replaced the Turkish lira as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Turkey. For more
information, see “—Foreign currency gain related to hyperinflationary subsidiaries” below.

**Results of Operations**

**_Net sales by Segment_**

In “Net sales by Segment” and in certain of the discussions and tables that follow, we exclude the impact of
foreign currency translation when presenting Net sales information, which we define as “constant dollar,” and we
exclude acquisitions in the first year after closing and the impact of foreign currency translation when presenting Net
sales information, which we define as “organic.” Changes in Net sales excluding the impact of foreign currency
translation is a Non-GAAP financial measure. As a global business, it is important that we take into account the
effects of foreign currency translation when we view our results and plan our strategies. Nonetheless, we cannot
control changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, when we look at our financial results to measure
the core performance of our business, we may exclude the impact of foreign currency translation by translating our
current period results at prior period foreign currency exchange rates. We also may adjust for the impact of foreign
currency translation when making incentive compensation determinations. As a result, we believe that these
presentations are useful internally and useful to investors in evaluating our performance.

**Institutional.** Net sales increased $4.9 million, or 1.0%, during the three months ended March 31, 2023
compared with the three months ended March 31, 2022. Foreign currency translation had a negative effect of $29.8
million. On a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $34.7 million, or 7.3%, as compared with the three months
ended March 31, 2022, with our acquisitions contributing $3.7 million of growth. Organic sales increased by 6.6%,
primarily due to price increases to mitigate the effect of inflation, and volume growth through a combination of new
customer wins, innovation, and continued expansion with our existing customers.

**Food & Beverage. Net sales increased $31.1 million, or 16.6%, during the three months ended March 31,**
2023 as compared with the three months ended March 31, 2022. Foreign currency translation had a negative effect
of $17.3 million. On a constant U.S. dollar basis, Net sales increased $48.4 million, or 25.8%, primarily due to price
increases to mitigate the effect of inflation, volume growth through new customer wins, and success with the rollout
of water treatment solutions.

**_Cost of sales and gross profit. Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies_**
consumed in the production of product, as well as labor and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and
convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Also included are expenses associated with
service organization, quality oversight, warranty costs and share-based compensation.

Our gross profit was $219.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and $236.1 million
during the three months ended March 31, 2022, and our gross margin was 31.6% during the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 35.8% during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Gross profit during the three months
ended March 31, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by $18.1 million of non-recurring costs related to consolidating
certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities within Europe and North America, $17.2 million of foreign
currency translation, and a $1.8 million increase in share-based compensation. Gross profit was positively impacted
by higher sales volumes and price increases as described above, which were offset by additional freight costs,
increased inflation, and higher labor and manufacturing costs.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised_**
primarily of marketing, research and development and administrative costs. Administrative costs, among other
things, include share-based compensation, professional consulting expenditures, administrative salaries and wages,
certain software and hardware costs and facilities costs.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $219.1 million during the three months ended March 31,
2023 compared to $213.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. The increase of $5.4 million was
primarily due to increases in employee compensation and benefit costs due to inflationary labor increases. These
increases were partially offset by $11.5 million of favorable foreign currency translation and a $5.9 million decrease
in share-based compensation.

**_Transaction and integration costs. Transaction and integration costs were $8.0 million during the three_**
months ended March 31, 2023 and $4.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022. These costs consist
primarily of professional and consulting services which are non-operational in nature, costs related to strategic
initiatives, acquisition-related costs, costs incurred in preparing to become a publicly traded company, and costs
related to the Acquisition.

**_Amortization of intangible assets acquired. In connection with our various business acquisitions, the_**
acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities were recorded as of the
acquisition date at their respective fair values. Amortization of intangible assets acquired was $21.9 million and
$24.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and during the three months ended March 31, 2022,
respectively.

**_Restructuring and exit costs. We recorded restructuring and exit costs of $0.5 million and $9.8 million_**
during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and during the three months ended March 31, 2022, respectively. In
2021, we began a strategic initiative to consolidate certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities within Europe
and North America, which also includes opening a new manufacturing and warehousing facility in North America.
We anticipate that these actions will both expand our production capacity and allow us to better manage our
inventory, supply chain and workforce. We expect to incur approximately $153.0 million of total costs related to this
project, and have already charged $138.0 million over the life of the project, $18.4 million of which were charged
during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Costs incurred during the three months ended March 31, 2023 of
$18.1 million of non-recurring other costs related to facilities consolidations are reflected in Cost of sales and $0.3
million are reflected in Restructuring and exit costs. Our remaining costs for this project are approximately $15.2
million at March 31, 2023.

Cost estimates for this project have been impacted by an inflationary macro environment with constraints
around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary short-term measures were taken to minimize disruption to
customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily establishing additional warehouses,
paying higher freight costs during warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery. See Note 16 —
Restructuring and Exit Activities in the Notes to the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere
in this offering memorandum.

**_Non-operating results. Our non-operating results were as follows:_**

**Three Months** **Three Months**

Interest expense ........................................................ $ 28.2 $ 30.3

subsidiaries ........................................................... (3.1) (0.3)
Other (income) expense, net ..................................... (10.7) (8.9)
$ 14.4 $ 21.1


**_Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2023 of $28.0_**
million, $5.8 million and $(7.4) million related to the Existing Diversey Credit Agreement, the Existing Diversey
Notes and other financial instruments (primarily derivatives), respectively. The facilities under the Existing Diversey
Credit Agreement are variable-interest rate debt, and the increase in interest expense during the three months ended
March 31, 2023 related to these facilities is due to an increase in LIBOR as a result of higher U.S. federal interest
rates. The recovery of interest expense during 2023 for the other financial instruments is primarily due to the impact
of our interest rate and currency derivatives.

We incurred interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $18.6 million, $5.8 million
and $4.1 million related to the Existing Diversey Credit Agreement, the Existing Diversey Notes and other financial
instruments (primarily derivatives), respectively.

Amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount totaling $1.8 million during the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and during the three months ended March 31, 2022 are included in the interest
expense line item disclosed above.

**_Foreign currency gain related to hyperinflationary subsidiaries. The economies of Argentina and Turkey_**
were designated as highly inflationary economies under U.S. GAAP on July 1, 2018 and April 1, 2022, respectively.
Therefore, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira as the functional currency for our
subsidiaries in these countries. All local currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into
U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and any changes in the exchange rate are reflected in
foreign currency gain related to our hyperinflationary subsidiaries.

**_Other (income) expense, net. Our other (income) expense, net was as follows:_**


**Three Months** **Three Months**

Interest income ............................................................. $ (1.7) $ (0.7)

Other, net ..................................................................... (1.3) 0.9
Total other (income) expense, net ................................ $ (10.7) $ (8.9)

The change in the interest income was primarily due to the fluctuation of our cash balances.

Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro
versus the U.S. dollar, which impacts our U.S. dollar denominated debt held at our Euro functional entity. These
were partially offset by an inverse impact on our tax receivable agreement.

The realized foreign exchange gains and losses were primarily due to internal cash-pooling activity.

In accordance with the provisions contained in Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Compensation –
_Retirement Benefits, we record net pension income when the expected return on plan assets exceeds the interest_
costs associated with these plans.

The adjustment of our tax indemnification asset was due to the lapse of statute of limitations for
unrecognized tax benefits.

The tax receivable agreement adjustments were due to changes in tax laws and changes in the valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets; therefore there was a net reduction of the tax benefits under the tax
receivable agreement.

**_Income tax provision. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the difference in the statutory income_**
tax benefit and the recorded income tax provision was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation
allowance related to limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and the realizability of net operating losses.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit and the
recorded income tax provision was primarily attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance related to
limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, and income tax expense related to non-deductible shared-based
compensation.

**Institutional.** Adjusted EBITDA decreased $15.4 million, or 29.1%, during the three months ended March
31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Foreign currency translation had a negative effect
of $4.1 million. On a constant U.S. dollar basis, Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended March 31, 2023
decreased $11.3 million, or 21.3%, as compared with the three months ended March 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA
margin decreased from 11.2% during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to 7.9% during the three months
ended March 31, 2023, which reflected a decline in profit margin due to increased inflation, higher freight costs,
higher manufacturing costs and higher labor costs. These were partially offset by volume growth and price
increases. In periods of significant inflation, we may experience a lag between our ability to recover both the cost
and margin in the short term.

**Food & Beverage.** Adjusted EBITDA increased $3.6 million, or 16.3%, during the three months ended
March 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Foreign currency translation had a negative
effect of $3.0 million. On a constant dollar basis, Adjusted EBITDA during the three months ended March 31, 2023
increased $6.6 million, or 29.9%, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2022. Adjusted EBITDA
margin decreased from 11.8% during the three months ended March 31, 2022 to 11.7% during the three months
ended March 31, 2023, which reflected a decline in gross profit margin due to high input cost inflation, particularly
in Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine war, which were partially offset by volume growth and price increases. In
periods of significant inflation, we may experience a lag between our ability to recover both the cost and margin in
the short term.

**Corporate Costs.** Corporate costs decreased from $14.8 million during the three months ended March 31,
2022 to $10.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by changes
in other (income) expense, net.

**2022 Net Sales .............................** $ 1,951.5 70.6% 814.4 29.4% 2,765.9

**Institutional. Net sales increased $33.1 million, or 1.7%, in 2022 compared with 2021. Foreign currency**
translation had a negative effect of $191.0 million. On a constant dollar basis, Net sales increased $224.1 million, or
11.7%, with our acquisitions contributing $49.3 million of growth. Organic sales increased by 9.1% in 2022 as
compared to 2021, primarily due to price increases to mitigate the effect of inflation, and volume growth (excluding
Infection Prevention products) through a combination of new customer wins, innovation, and continued expansion
with our existing customers. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales of Infection Prevention
products, which have returned to a more normalized level, after demand increased significantly in 2020 and in the
first quarter of 2021.

**Food & Beverage. Net sales increased $113.9 million, or 16.3%, in 2022 compared with 2021. Foreign**
currency translation had a negative effect of $81.3 million. On a constant dollar basis, Net sales increased $195.2
million, or 27.9%, with our acquisitions contributing $42.6 million of growth. Organic sales increased by 21.8%
primarily due to price increases, volume growth through new customer wins, and success with the rollout of water
treatment solutions.

Cost of sales and gross profit. Cost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies
consumed in the production of product, as well as labor and direct overhead expense necessary to acquire and
convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Also included are expenses associated with
service organization, quality oversight, warranty costs and share-based compensation.

**For the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021**

Our gross profit was $875.8 million in 2022 and $1,017.3 million in 2021, and our gross margin was 31.7%
in 2022 and 38.8% in 2021. Gross profit for 2022 was unfavorably impacted by $99.4 million of foreign currency
translation, $84.8 million of non-recurring costs related to consolidating certain manufacturing and warehousing
facilities within Europe and North America, and an $18.3 million charge for excess inventory related to COVID-19,
which were offset by a $7.8 million decrease in share-based compensation. Excluding the impact of these items,
gross profit decreased by $53.2 million during 2022, and was positively impacted by price increases and higher sales
volumes as described above, which were offset by increased inflation, additional freight costs, and higher labor and
manufacturing costs.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised primarily of marketing, research and
development and administrative costs. Administrative costs, among other things, include share-based compensation,
professional consulting expenditures, administrative salaries and wages, certain software and hardware costs and
facilities costs.

**For the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021**

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $797.6 million in 2022 compared to $826.8 million in
2021. The decrease of $29.2 million during 2022 was due in part in part to a $51.2 million decrease in share-based
compensation and $65.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. These decreases were partially offset by
increases in employee compensation and benefit costs due to inflationary labor increases.

**_Transaction and integration costs_**

Transaction and integration costs were $51.3 million, $45.8 million, and $37.0 million during 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively. These costs consist primarily of professional and consulting services which are non
156


-----

operational in nature, costs related to strategic initiatives, acquisition-related costs, and costs incurred in preparing to
become a publicly traded company. Costs incurred in 2022 and 2021 in connection with becoming a publicly traded
company were $8.0 million and $14.7 million, respectively.

**_Management fee_**

Pursuant to a management agreement with Bain Capital, we were obligated to pay Bain Capital an annual
management fee of $7.5 million plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with management
services provided. The management agreement was terminated in March 2021, pursuant to its terms upon the
consummation of our IPO, and we recorded a termination fee of $17.5 million during 2021. We paid Bain Capital
$19.4 million and $7.5 million in management fees during 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**_Amortization of intangible assets acquired_**

In connection with our various business acquisitions, the acquired assets, including separately identifiable
intangible assets, and assumed liabilities were recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values.
Amortization of intangible assets acquired was $90.2 million, $96.7 million, and $98.2 million during 2022, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

**_Restructuring and exit costs_**

We recorded restructuring and exit costs of $48.7 million, $38.4 million, and $32.1 million during 2022,
2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2021, we began a strategic initiative to consolidate certain manufacturing and
warehousing facilities within Europe and North America, which also includes opening a new manufacturing and
warehousing facility in North America. We anticipate that these actions will both expand our production capacity
and allow us to better manage our inventory, supply chain and workforce. We expect to incur approximately $138.0
million of total costs related to this project, and charged $120.0 million over the life of the project and $111.9
million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Costs incurred in 2022 of $27.1 million are reflected in
restructuring and exit costs and $84.8 million of non-recurring other costs related to facilities consolidations are
reflected in Cost of sales. Our remaining costs for this project are approximately $18.5 million at December 31,
2022. Cost estimates for these projects have been impacted by an inflationary macro environment with constraints
around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary short-term measures were taken to minimize disruption to
customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily establishing additional warehouses,
paying higher freight costs during warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery. In the fourth
quarter of 2022, we also incurred restructuring costs related to a reduction in headcount to realign our personnel
resources with our business needs, which was aimed at maintaining a competitive cost structure and workforce
optimization. See Note 18 — Restructuring and Exit Activities in the Notes to the Diversey Consolidated Financial
Statements.

**_Non-operating results._**

Our non-operating results were as follows:

**Year Ended** **Year Ended**

Other (income) expense, net ......................................... (36.6) (0.1)

$ 73.5 $ 139.7

**_Interest Expense_**

We incurred interest expense during 2022 of $73.0 million, $23.4 million and $8.3 million related to the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2021 Senior Notes and other financial instruments (primarily derivatives),
respectively. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are variable-interest rate debt, and the increase in interest expense
during 2022 is due to an increase in LIBOR. The 2021 Senior Notes are fixed-interest rate debt, and the decrease in
interest expense during 2022 is due to our September 2021 debt refinancing, which reduced the fixed rate of interest.

157


-----

The decrease in interest expense during 2022 for the other financial instruments is primarily due to the impact of our
interest rate and currency derivatives.

We incurred interest expense during 2021 of $57.2 million, $28.7 million and $13.1 million related to the
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the 2021 and 2017 Senior Notes and other financial instruments (primarily
derivatives), respectively.

Amortization of deferred financing costs and original issue discount totaling $7.3 million and $27.3 million
for 2022 and 2021, respectively, are included in the interest expense line item disclosed above. Amortization
expense in 2021 included $18.9 million of accelerated interest amortization was incurred during 2021.

**_Foreign currency loss related to hyperinflationary subsidiaries_**

The economies of Argentina and Turkey were designated as highly inflationary economies under U.S.
GAAP on July 1, 2018 and April 1, 2022, respectively. Therefore, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso and
the Turkish lira as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in these countries. All local currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and
any changes in the exchange rate are reflected in foreign currency (gain) loss related to our hyperinflationary
subsidiaries.

**_Loss on extinguishment of debt_**

On September 29, 2021, we completed the sale of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625%
Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers in reliance
on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons (as
defined in Regulation S) pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the
issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, together with borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as
defined below) and cash on hand, to redeem all of the €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior
Notes due 2025 (the “2017 Senior Notes”), pay fees and/or expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
2021 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes.

We redeemed the 2017 Senior Notes at the redemption price (expressed as percentages of principal
amount) of 101.4%, for a total of $536.7 million, which consisted of $529.1 million of principal amount and $7.6
million of redemption premium. The premium cost and the balance of the unamortized deferred financing costs
related to the 2017 Senior Notes of $8.0 million were charged to Loss on Extinguishment of Debt during 2021.

**_Other (income) expense, net._**

Our other (income) expense, net was as follows:

The change in the interest income was primarily due to the fluctuation of our cash balances.

Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were primarily due to the change in the value of the Euro

**_Income tax provision_**

For 2022, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit of $(35.2) million and the recorded income tax
benefit of $(16.2) million was primarily attributable to a net $35.9 million increase in the valuation allowance as a
result of changes in the assessment of the reliability of deferred tax assets, offset by a net favorable change of
$(25.1) million due to changes to unrecognized tax benefits.

For 2021, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit of $(28.4) million and the recorded income tax
provision of $25.3 million was primarily attributable to $15.6 million of income tax expense related to nondeductible share-based compensation, and a net $23.8 million increase in the valuation allowance as a result of
changes in the assessment of the reliability of deferred tax assets.

2021. Foreign currency translation had a negative effect of $35.4 million. On a constant dollar basis, Diversey
Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 decreased $19.6 million, or 6.1%, as compared with 2021. Our acquisitions contributed
$6.8 million of growth in 2022. Diversey Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 16.7% in 2021 to 13.6% in
2022, which reflected a decline in profit margin due to increased inflation, higher freight costs, higher

manufacturing costs, higher labor costs, and a decrease in sales of Infection Prevention products. These were
partially offset by volume growth (excluding Infection Prevention products) and price increases. In periods of
significant inflation, we may experience a lag between our ability to recover both the cost and margin in the short
term.

**Food & Beverage. Diversey Adjusted EBITDA decreased $37.2 million, or 27.8%, in 2022 compared with**
2021. Foreign currency translation had a negative effect of $9.7 million. On a constant dollar basis, Diversey
Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 decreased $27.5 million, or 20.6%, when compared to 2021. Our acquisitions
contributed $3.5 million of growth in 2022. Diversey Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 19.1% in 2021 to
11.8% in 2022, which reflected a decline in gross profit margin due to high input cost inflation, particularly in
Europe due to the Russia-Ukraine war, which were partially offset by volume growth and price increases. In periods
of significant inflation, we may experience a lag between our ability to recover both the cost and margin in the short
term.

**Corporate Costs. Corporate costs decreased from $43.4 million in 2021 to $31.2 million in 2022. The**
reduction was primarily driven by decreases in employee incentive compensation and changes in realized foreign
exchange gains and other (income) expense, net.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

We present financial information that conforms to U.S. GAAP. We also present financial information that
does not conform to U.S. GAAP, as we believe it is useful to investors. In addition, Non-GAAP measures are used
by management to review and analyze our operating performance and, along with other data, as internal measures
for setting annual budgets and forecasts, assessing financial performance, providing guidance and comparing our
financial performance with our peers.

Non-GAAP financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate
the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and/or gains (which
may not occur in each period presented) and other items that management believes might otherwise make
comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing
operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts. Non-GAAP measures do not purport to
represent any similarly titled U.S. GAAP information and are not an indicator of our performance under U.S.
GAAP. Investors are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these Non-GAAP measures. Further, investors are
urged to review and consider carefully the adjustments made by management to the most directly comparable U.S.
GAAP financial measure to arrive at these Non-GAAP financial measures, described below.

Our Non-GAAP financial measures may also be considered in calculations of our performance measures
set by our Board of Directors for purposes of determining incentive compensation. The Non-GAAP financial
metrics exclude items that we consider to be certain specified items (“Special Items”), such as restructuring charges,
transaction and integration costs, certain transaction and other charges related to acquisitions and divestitures, gains
and losses related to acquisitions and divestitures, and certain other items. We evaluate unusual or Special Items on
an individual basis. Our evaluation of whether to exclude an unusual or Special Item for purposes of determining our
Non-GAAP financial measures considers both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the item, including among
other things (i) its nature, (ii) whether it relates to our ongoing business operations, and (iii) whether we expect it to
occur as part of our normal ongoing business on a regular basis.

Our calculation of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other
companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these
Non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute
for, related U.S. GAAP measures.

**Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA**

We believe that the financial statements and other financial information presented have been prepared in a
manner that complies, in all material respects, with U.S. GAAP, and are consistent with current practices with the
exception of the presentation of certain Non-GAAP financial measures, including Diversey EBITDA and Diversey
Adjusted EBITDA. Diversey EBITDA consists of net income (loss) before income tax provisions (benefit), interest
expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Diversey Adjusted EBITDA consists of Diversey EBITDA
adjusted to (i) eliminate certain non-operating income or expense items, (ii) eliminate the impact of certain non-cash
and other items that are included in net income and Diversey EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our

160


-----

ongoing operating performance, and (iii) eliminate certain unusual and non-recurring items impacting results in a
particular period.

Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures that are not required by, or
presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of
our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, net income
(loss), income (loss) before income tax provision or any other performance measures derived in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of
liquidity in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our method of calculating Diversey EBITDA and Diversey
Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the methods used by other companies.

We consider Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our financial
performance. Additionally, we believe Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by
securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. We also
believe that investors, analysts and rating agencies consider Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA
useful means of measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and evaluating our financial performance,
and management uses these measures for one or more of these purposes.

Our presentation of Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an
inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Diversey EBITDA and
Diversey Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in
isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. The use of Diversey EBITDA
and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool, including the following:

    - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements
for, our working capital needs;

    - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash
requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;

    - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash
requirements to pay our income taxes;

    - Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted
EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements;

    - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or
future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and

    - Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their
usefulness as a comparative measure.

Diversey Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments that represent a cash expense or that represent a non-cash
charge that may relate to a future cash expense, and some of these expenses are of a type that we expect to incur in
the future, although we cannot predict the amount of any such future charge.

Because of these limitations, Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered
as a replacement for net income or as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to service our indebtedness or
invest in our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and
using Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA only for supplemental purposes.

**Adjusted Net Income**

Adjusted Net Income is also Non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted Net Income as net
income (loss) adjusted to (i) eliminate certain non-operating income or expense items, (ii) eliminate the impact of
certain non-cash and other items that are included in net income that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing
operating performance, (iii) eliminate certain unusual and non-recurring items impacting results in a particular
period, and (iv) reflect the tax effect of items (i) through (iii) and other tax special items.

161


-----

We believe that, in addition to our results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, Adjusted Net Income
is useful in evaluating our business, results of operations and financial condition. We believe that Adjusted Net
Income may be helpful to investors because they provide consistency and comparability with past financial
performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of our operations and financial results, as they eliminate the
effects of certain variables from period to period for reasons that we do not believe reflect our underlying operating
performance or are unusual or infrequent in nature. However, Adjusted Net Income is presented for supplemental
informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute or alternative for financial
information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool; some of these limitations are:

    - Adjusted Net Income does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

    - other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Net differently, which
reduce their usefulness as comparative measures; and

    - in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our
calculation of Adjusted Net Income and our presentation of Adjusted Net Income should not be
construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from
the calculation of Adjusted Net Income.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted Net Income alongside other financial
performance measures, including net loss, basic and diluted loss per share, and our other U.S. GAAP results.
Adjusted Net Income are not presentations made in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the use of these terms may
vary from other companies in our industry. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure to Adjusted Net
Income is net loss.

The following table reconciles loss before income tax provision (benefit) to Diversey EBITDA and
Diversey Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:

(1) These costs consist primarily of professional and consulting services which are non-operational in nature, costs related to
strategic initiatives, acquisition-related costs, costs incurred in preparing to become a publicly traded company, and costs
related to the Acquisition.

(2) Includes costs related to restructuring programs and business exit activities. See “Note 16 — Restructuring and Exit
Activities in the Notes to the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements,” included elsewhere in offering memorandum.

(3) Represents other costs related to consolidating certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities within Europe and North
America, which are non-recurring and included in Cost of Sales in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(4) Argentina and Turkey were deemed to have highly inflationary economies and the functional currencies for our Argentina
and Turkey operations were changed from the Argentine peso and Turkish lira to the U.S. dollar and remeasurement
charges/credits are recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than as a component of
Cumulative Translation Adjustment on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(5) In connection with the original acquisition of the Diversey business in 2017, the purchase agreement governing the
transaction includes indemnification provisions with respect to tax liabilities. The offset to this adjustment is included in
income tax provision.

(6) In connection with various acquisitions we recorded fair value increases to our inventory. These amounts represent the
amortization of this increase.

(7) Represents the net impact of the expected return on plan assets, interest cost, and settlement cost components of net periodic
defined benefit income related to our defined benefit pension plans.

(8) Represents the unrealized foreign currency exchange impact on our operations, primarily attributed to the valuation of the
U.S. dollar-denominated debt held by our European entity.

(9) Represents the fees to complete the sale of the receivables without recourse under our accounts receivable securitization
agreements. See “Note 5 — Financial Statement Details in the Notes to the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements,”
included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

(10) Represents compensation expense associated with our share-based equity and liability awards. See “Note 15 — Share-Based
Compensation in the Notes to the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements,” included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum.

(11) Represents the adjustment to our tax receivable agreement liability due to changes in valuation allowances that impact the
realizability of the attributes of the tax receivable agreement.

(12) Represents the gain on sale of property and equipment, primarily attributed to the sale of certain facilities.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our primary sources of cash are the collection of trade receivables generated from the sales of our products
and services to our customers and amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below),
factoring and accounts receivable securitization programs. Our primary uses of cash are payments for operating
expenses, investments in working capital, capital expenditures, interest, taxes, debt obligations, restructuring
expenses and other long-term liabilities. Our principal source of liquidity, in addition to cash from operating
activities, has been through our Revolving Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents
of $125.7 million and unused borrowing capacity of $444.5 million under our Revolving Credit Facility. We believe
that cash flow from operations, available cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit
Facility will be adequate to service our debt, meet our liquidity needs and fund necessary capital expenditures for the
next twelve months. We also believe these financial resources will allow us to manage our business operations for
the foreseeable future, including mitigating unexpected reductions in revenues and delays in payments from our
customers. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and
extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities and the
introduction of new and enhanced products and services offerings.

**_Historical Cash Flows_**

Note that the table and discussion that follows include restricted cash as part of net cash in accordance with
the provisions of ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows. We include restricted cash from our compensating
balance deposits as part of our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash for purposes of preparing our
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

The following table presents a summary of our net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and
financing activities:

**Three Months** **Three Months**
**Ended** **Ended**

**(in millions)** **March 31, 2023** **March 31, 2022** **Change**

Net cash provided by (used in) operating
activities ............................................. $ (42.4) $ 45.9 $ (88.3)
Net cash provided by (used in) investing
activities ............................................. $ (30.0) $ (68.7) $ 38.7
Net cash provided by (used in) financing
activities ............................................. $ (7.7) $ 33.8 $ (41.5)


**_Operating activities_**

Cash flows from operating activities decreased $88.3 million during 2023 as compared to 2022, which was
primarily attributable to unfavorable fluctuations in working capital items totaling $74.3 million. The changes in
working capital reflect unfavorable fluctuations in accounts payable of $79.6 million, other assets and liabilities of
$8.7 million (primarily relating to timing of payroll related accruals, rebates and lease receivables), inventory of
$4.7 million, offset by a favorable fluctuation in trade receivables of $18.7 million.

**_Investing activities_**

Cash flows from investing activities are primarily impacted by the timing of business acquisitions and
capital investments in the business.

In 2023, we acquired NSS Enterprise, Inc., a manufacturer of floor cleaning machines based in the United
States, and our total cash paid for all acquisitions was $11.7 million.

In 2022, we purchased Shorrock Trichem Ltd, a distributor of cleaning and hygiene solutions and services
based in northwest England, and our total cash paid for all acquisitions was $41.4 million.

Our investments in dosing and dispensing equipment and capital expenditures totaled $24.5 million and
$27.3 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively, due to new customer wins and opening a new warehouse and
manufacturing facility in North America in the second half of 2022.

**_Financing activities_**

Cash flows from financing activities primarily reflect derivative transactions and borrowings and
repayment of debt.

In 2023, we paid $7.7 million on short-term and long-term borrowings.

In 2022, we terminated existing derivative agreements, receiving net proceeds of $45.3 million, and
simultaneously entered into new at-market derivative agreements with the same notional amount and maturity date
as the terminated derivatives. Additionally, we paid $11.5 million on short-term and long-term borrowings.

On September 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which
provided for a new $1,500.0 million senior secured U.S. dollar denominated term loan (the “2021 U.S. Dollar Term
Loan”) in addition to the existing $450.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and
together with the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan, the “New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The 2021 U.S. Dollar
Term Loan matures on September 29, 2028, while the Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 28, 2026. As of
March 31, 2023, the interest rate for the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan is 7.58%. As of March 31, 2023, we were in
compliance with all covenants under the agreements governing the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

On September 29, 2021, we completed the sale of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes due 2029 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule
144A under the Securities Act of 1993, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons (as defined in
Regulation S) pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the
2021 Senior Notes, together with borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and cash on hand, to
redeem all of the €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2017 Senior
Notes”), pay fees and/or expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and for general
corporate purposes. The 2021 Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2029, bear interest at 4.625%, and interest is
payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2022. At March 31, 2023, we
were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of some assets and liabilities and,
in some instances, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the applicable reporting period. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. These estimates involve judgments with respect to, among other things,
future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control. As a result, actual
amounts could differ from these estimates.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

Our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing and selling products and services. Revenue
from contracts with customers is recognized using a five-step model consisting of the following: (1) identify the
contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction
price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue
when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. Performance obligations are satisfied when we transfer control of
a good or service to a customer, which can occur over time or at a point in time. The amount of revenue recognized
is based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, including the
expected value of variable consideration. The customer’s ability and intent to pay the transaction price is assessed in
determining whether a contract exists with the customer. If collectability of substantially all of the consideration in a
contract is not probable, consideration received is not recognized as revenue unless the consideration is

165


-----

nonrefundable and we no longer have an obligation to transfer additional goods or services to the customer or
collectability becomes probable.

Product sales, to end-customers or distributors, represents approximately 98% of our revenue and is
recognized at a point-in-time, which is generally at the point in time when products have been shipped, right to
payment has been obtained and risk of loss has been transferred.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled based on customer
contracts. For sales to distributors, revenue is adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including but not limited
to estimated discounts and distributor rebate programs. These estimates are determined based upon historical
experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to
variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary.

**_Business Combinations_**

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the
acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities to be recorded as of the
acquisition date at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets
acquired, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Fair
value determination is subject to a significant degree of estimates.

The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessments of
factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate
discount rates at the date of the acquisition. Where appropriate, external advisors are consulted to assist in the
determination of fair value. For non-observable market values, fair value has been determined using acceptable
valuation principles (e.g., multiple excess earnings, relief from royalty and cost methods) which is considered to be a
Level 3 fair value.

The results of operations for businesses acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from
the acquisition date.

**_Long-Lived Assets_**

Long-lived assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, the aggregate amount of which was
$1,513.7 million and $1,602.2 million, as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Such longlived assets primarily consist of definite-lived intangible assets in an aggregate amount of $1,165.9 million and
$1,292.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

We perform an impairment review for definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships,
contracts, intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Such
events may include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group,
change in manner in which an asset is being used, significant change in business climate and significant cash flow or
operating losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of the asset. We calculate the
undiscounted value of the projected cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset
or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying value of the asset or asset group. If the carrying
amount is found to be greater than the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows of the asset or asset group, we
record an impairment loss of the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset or asset group. In addition,
we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.

Definite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names and customer relationships are amortized over their
estimated economic lives. The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these
assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the balance sheet. We evaluate these assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
recoverable.

**_Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets. Our
goodwill had a carrying value of $462.8 million and $471.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31,

166


-----

2021, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Diversey trade name, had a carrying value
of $818.2 million and $854.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

We review goodwill for possible impairment on a reporting unit level, which are consistent with our
operating segments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on an annual basis as of October
1st of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has
declined below its carrying value. Such events may include, but are not limited to, impairment of other assets or
establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, cash flow or operating losses at a reporting unit,
negative current events or long-term outlooks for our industry, and negative adjustments to future forecasts. In
performing the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have the option under U.S. GAAP to qualitatively
assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we
conclude from the qualitative assessment that there are no indicators of impairment, we do not perform a
quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of October 1. U.S. GAAP provides a set of
qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry, market and company specific factors, including cost factors,
overall financial performance, market capitalization, and other events specific to Diversey to consider in performing
the qualitative assessment described above, which factors are not all inclusive; management considers the factors it
deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments.

If we conclude from our qualitative assessment that there are indicators of impairment and that a
quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair
value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the
reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment and no further
testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount of the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

Our annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating
segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment,
which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time we change our
operating segments. If the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly-formed reporting units, the allocation is
made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values.

Based on the results of our 2022 and 2021 annual qualitative assessments, we concluded that it was more
likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value. As such, it was not
necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that our reporting units were not
impaired.

The fair value of our reporting units is determined using both an income approach, which is based on
discounted cash flows (“DCF”), and a market approach when we quantitatively test goodwill for impairment, either
on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 of each year. Significant judgments inherent in using a DCF
analysis include the selection of appropriate discount and long-term growth rates and estimating the amount and
timing of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on our most
recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted
growth rates. The discount rates and growth rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent
in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including
the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit’s current results and
forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors, and reflect our best estimate
as of the impairment testing date. Any changes in such assumptions or estimates as a result of changes in our
budgets, forecasts or negative macroeconomic trends could significantly affect the value of our reporting units
which could impact whether an impairment of goodwill has occurred. Determining fair value using a market
approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer
group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is
applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for
our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model,
margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.

If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment
equal to the excess is recorded. The 2022 and 2021 annual assessments of the indefinite-lived intangible asset did
not identify any impairments.

167


-----

When performing a quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset
using a relief from royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the
selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash
flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future
cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon
an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license our trade names. The future cash flows
are based on our most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based,
in part, on forecasted revenue growth rates. Assumptions used in the relief from royalty DCF analyses, including the
discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset,
as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in our annual indefinite-lived
impairment assessment was 9.5% in 2022, and the royalty rate used in 2022 was 3.0%.

Based on the results of our 2021 annual qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than
not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded the carrying value. As such, it was not
necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that the indefinite-lived intangible asset
was not impaired.

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible asset involves uncertainties
because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth
and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business
strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates
due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, or other factors
could negatively affect the fair value of our reporting units or the indefinite-lived intangible asset and result in a
material impairment charge in the future.

**_Income taxes_**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax
assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to
reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be
recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income
in the period that includes the enactment date.

We do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested. Where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries, we provide
for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings.

We recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position
will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%
likelihood of being realized. Additionally, we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax
benefits as a component of provision (benefit) for taxes on income.

**_Pension Benefits_**

In connection with the Diversey Acquisition, we assumed certain defined benefit plan obligations and
acquired certain related plan assets for current employees of our subsidiaries. In addition, we implemented a
replacement retiree health care reimbursement plan for certain U.S. employees.

The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial
assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan-by-plan basis each fiscal year.
The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of
return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on
an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing
retirement benefits.

In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers
reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset

168


-----

allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations
provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of
compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine
benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31.

In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and
liabilities recognized in the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Note 13 — Retirement Plans in the
Notes to the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements,” included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

Refer to the sub-section, “New Accounting Guidance,” within Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies in the Notes to our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**Off Balance Sheet Arrangements**

We have reviewed our off‑balance sheet arrangements and have determined that none of our arrangements
that are not already disclosed in our consolidated financial statements have a material current effect or is reasonably
likely to have a material future effect on our consolidated financial statements, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.

**_Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations_**

We are party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations. These contracts
primarily consist of:

    - product and service warranties with respect to certain products sold to customers in the ordinary course
of business. These warranties typically provide that products will conform to specifications. We
generally do not establish a liability for product warranty based on a percentage of sales or other
formula. We accrue a product warrant liability on a transaction‑specific basis depending on the
individual facts and circumstances related to each sale. Both the liability and annual expense related to
product warranties are immaterial to our consolidated financial position and results of operations; and

    - licenses of intellectual property by us to third parties in which we have agreed to indemnify the
licensee against third-party infringement claims.

**BUSINESS**

**Company Overview**

**_History and Evolution_**

The Escrow Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer. The Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent. Parent, doing business as “Solenis” from November 9, 2021, was formed on June 29, 2021 in connection
with the Solenis Acquisition as an exempted limited partnership registered and domiciled under the laws of the
Cayman Islands. Parent and several other holding companies and partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum.
Parent exists as the “successor” entity for the specific purposes of (1) having consummated the Solenis Acquisition,
and (2) having received the Sigura Contribution. Accordingly, the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition and the
Sigura Contribution resulted in the consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses into
the business of Parent from November 9, 2021. On September 9, 2022, Clearon was acquired by Parent and its
subsidiaries from Hui Yu Xin American LLC.

**_Combined Company_**

We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will create a platform with a shared commercial
focus and significant global scale in complementary end markets. After giving effect to the Transactions, the
combined company will be able to grow and provide a number of attractive cross-selling opportunities, including
meeting customers’ increasing demand for “one-stop shop” service models across water management, cleaning and
hygiene solutions.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to be better positioned to benefit from growing
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and macroeconomic trends, including those around customer
sustainability goals and focus points, such as: heightened focus on water consumption and recycling; the need for
improved energy efficiency and raw material management; increased consumer focus on hygiene; increased
environmental legislation being implemented globally; and increased levels of shipping and packaging. Together,
we will offer a diverse, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, which will limit any obsolescence risk as
no product or solution represents a material part of our business.

Solenis’ and Diversey’s combined segment, geographic and end market breakdown by revenue for the
twelve months ended March 31, 2023 is illustrated below.[(1) ]

(2) Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding.

Our leading technology has been at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry and we
have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products that we expect will drive significant value for our customers.

171


-----

The combination of Solenis and Diversey represents the coming together of two leading global products, services,
and technologies providers with proven track records of product innovation who offer truly differentiated solutions
to customers.

Prior to the Transactions, we already operate across a diverse set of growing end markets and our broad
geographic reach allows us to meet the needs of our customers globally. After giving effect to the Transactions, our
combined footprint will continue to span six continents, with reinforced strength and scale of presence, with an
increased number of laboratories and production facilities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve
all major developed markets and are closely integrated with our customers throughout the world. After giving effect
to the Transactions, through our global presence and differentiated service offering in growing markets, we believe
we will be a leading provider in all of our segments and will continue to benefit from positive secular trends such as
e-commerce for customers, an increased demand for sustainable packaging, a focus on ESG and incremental
disposable income increases in emerging markets. The following graphic summarizes the geographic reach of
laboratories and production facilities of the combined Solenis company following the Transactions. After giving
effect to the Transactions, we will operate 70 manufacturing facilities and 18 laboratories in 23 countries.

(1) Includes research, customer application, and development sites.
(2) Pro forma for Project Mega facility and associated plant consolidations. See “—Growth Strategy.”

There is limited existing overlap between Solenis’ and Diversey’s offerings in water treatment chemicals
with legacy Solenis operating in the water treatment and pool solutions markets and legacy Diversey operating in the
food and beverage and institutional end markets. We believe the combined company platform will be able to “circle
the customer” and create opportunities for new business wins, increasing our customer spending. For example in
hotels today, Solenis has a limited presence in pool solutions while Diversey provides kitchen care, building care,
floor care, infection prevention and laundry care. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe the fact that
Solenis and Diversey provide different services to their combined customers will provide the combined company
with the opportunity to offer existing hotel customers our full suite of products and services, including water
treatment. Similarly, Solenis does not currently serve cruise ships or hospitals but will have the opportunity to offer
its services to Diversey’s customers in these markets. Protein processing plants are another customer type that each
of Solenis and Diversey have a moderate presence with, and going forward, a combined company platform may
enable both companies to expand their offerings with such customers. We believe the Transactions present the
opportunity to combine our existing services into a “one-stop shop” provider across water management, cleaning

172


-----

and hygiene solutions for our customers. The following graphic summarizes the potential cross-selling opportunities
for the combined company.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be able to implement near-term strategic
initiatives in the legacy Diversey to better optimize processes, drive growth and create value. Some key initiatives
will include (i) increasing scale by bundling our leading global cleaning and water treatment solutions across
Industrial and Food & Beverage to increase win rates and cross-selling opportunities, (ii) increasing efficiencies by
standardizing corporate functions, (iii) implementing a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, (iv)
investing in growth opportunities such as expansion efforts within: North America commercial and institutional,
high growth global strategic accounts (“GSAs”), distributor partnerships and building out new product introduction
(NPI) capabilities and (v) applying our performance management capabilities to existing processes. We believe by
creating real-time visibility into financial performance we will be able to drive accountability at a more localized
level and assist in informing business decisions (such as pricing and have better insight into profitability and
distributors’ sell-through). We believe we will be able to further supplement our efforts by deploying commercial
excellence tools such as roll-outs and trainings. Additionally, we believe we can continue implementing Diversey’s
“Project Mega” by continuing to develop Diversey’s manufacturing and warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky
alongside consolidating certain existing service centers to provide manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and
insourcing opportunities.

We believe our business exhibits highly attractive financial characteristics, including significant recurring
revenues, improving margin profile and substantial free cash flow conversion. The combined company will provide
greater scale, a broader global reach, superior customer service capabilities and a number of attractive cross-selling
opportunities. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we generated pro forma Net sales on a combined
historical basis and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) of $7.2
billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, inclusive of $205 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from
actions expected to be taken within 24 months after the Acquisition and $40 million of cumulative run-rate annual
cost synergies from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and $13
million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24
months of the Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. We believe our combined earnings profile after giving effect to the
Transactions will generate significant free cash flow, which we expect will be used to support growth initiatives and
drive de-leveraging.

We believe that the Transactions create an opportunity to realize meaningful synergies resulting from the
integration of Solenis and Diversey. In combining these two complementary businesses, we believe the combined
company is entering a new and exciting chapter in a long history of helping customers address core challenges such
as water and energy management, partnering on sustainability issues to work towards a cleaner, safer world, and
reducing environmental impacts. We expect to realize approximately $205 million of synergies from integration
related to the consolidation of support functions and sales teams, the consolidation of sourcing of direct materials,
and the consolidation of facilities between the two businesses, as a result of actions expected to be taken within 24
months of the closing of the Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such
synergies. For more information on anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may impact our ability to

achieve such synergies or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the
Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the
adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies
and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies).”

to be marketed to Diversey’s existing customer base within its Food & Beverage segment. After giving effect to the
Transactions, Diversey’s Food & Beverage segment will become a reportable segment of the combined company.

We believe, based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, that we have a
leading market position in the Industrial Solutions segment, based on Net sales, and we believe we are one of only
three market participants, including Ecolab / Nalco and Suez, that are present in all geographies and market
segments. The industry is highly fragmented with many regional players, some of which have significant market
share in their respective regions. Based on the same report, the industrial chemicals market is expected to grow at a
4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025. The Industrial Solutions segment generated 20% of pro
forma Net sales for the combined Solenis company for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

**_Pool Solutions Segment (12% of Combined Company Net Sales)_**

Our Pool Solutions segment offers water care solutions and value-added services for residential and
commercial pools and spas. The water treatment process begins with testing; specifically pool pH and chlorine
levels on a weekly basis. The next step is balancing, i.e., maintaining certain levels of pH, total alkalinity and
calcium hardness. Sanitizing, which is keeping water clean and disinfected, is most frequently done using stabilized
chlorine products. Specialty maintenance products such as algaecides and clarifiers are typically used on a semimonthly basis, in addition to the normal sanitizing process, to target specific pool needs such as algae prevention or
stain control. Lastly, shock treatment can be used to address one-off pool care needs, especially following inclement
weather and high pool usage.

We are a leading producer of pool chemicals for the residential and commercial markets worldwide and
provide various water treatment products including shock, sanitizer, specialty maintenance products, and test strips.
Our offerings include a full suite of products and applications aimed at public pools, health clubs, aquatic parks,
hotels, motels, apartments and condominiums in the form of water-soluble pods, convenient floaters and automatic
feeders. Our portfolio of brands includes iconic brands such HTH®, Poolife®, GLB®, Leisure Time® and HTH
Spa®. We believe we are the world’s largest producer of calcium-hypoclorite (“cal-hypo”), a primary chemical used
in water treatment and sanitation.

We believe we are one of only two players with a complete brand and product offering in the U.S. pool and
spa chemicals market and we believe we are the only player with a truly global offering. We have total market
access to all residential channels from Mass Retail (40.6% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023), to Professional Dealer (29.3% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31,

2023), to Commercial (10.1% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023), to Repack
and Private Label (18.7% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023) and Other Pool
(1.3% of Pool Solutions Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023), as well as growing e-commerce
and Direct to Consumer (“DTC”) channels. Demand for products from the Pool Solutions segment is driven by the
existing installed base of pools in the regions it operates, which have seen growth tailwinds due to COVID-driven
investment in outdoor spaces. Going forward, ongoing maintenance of these pools will drive sustainable and
recurring future demand for our products. The Pool Solutions segment generated 12% of pro forma Net sales for the
combined Solenis company for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

We have relationships with key customers across channels including in (i) the mass retail market: Walmart,
Ace Hardware, Amazon and Costco; (ii) the pro dealer market: Pool Corp, Leslie’s Poolmart, Poolwerx, Heritage
Pool Group and a large fragmented base of individual pool and spa dealers; and (iii) in the commercial market: Pool
Corp, Sea World and Bellagio.

In our Institutional Solutions segment we will serve a wide range of customers. Representative customers
will include: Vizient, Ahold / Delhaize, Radisson, BP, ISS, Walmart, Sodexo, Accor, McDonald’s, Compass Group,
Yum! Brands, Intrakoop, Aramark and Amazon. We will be one of the major global players within the segment,
therefore, we believe we will have the product breadth, scale, supply chain flexibility and service capabilities to
compete with Ecolab. Further, we believe there is an opportunity to capture customers within underserved sectors
such as cruise ships, logistics, warehousing, casinos, and theme parks.

We believe that our Institutional Solutions segment’s revenue base will be recurring and stable due to the
‘sticky’ nature of our business model. Our cleaning products will be consumable in nature and require periodic
replacement, generating highly recurring revenue. Additionally, the optimal application of our chemicals will be
controlled by our proprietary dosing and dispensing equipment installed at customer sites, which will increase
customer switching costs and generate operating efficiencies for our customers. Based on a third-party report
completed in February 2023, manufacturing and commercial and healthcare and hospitality end markets are growing
at a CAGR of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively for the four year period 2022 to 2026. The Institutional Solutions
segment generated 27% of pro forma Net sales for the combined Solenis company for the twelve months ended
March 31, 2023.

production efficiencies through customized solutions that utilize our products. The highly integrated and customized
nature of the resulting solutions are expected to drive operational efficiencies as well as high switching costs for our
customers, leading to very high customer retention. The food and beverage industry is widely fragmented and we
believe the combined company has the ability to win business driven by an increasing customer demand for water
treatment being bundled with food and beverage solutions. Based on a third-party report completed in February
2023, food and beverage is growing at a CAGR of 6.5% for the four year period 2022 to 2026. The Food &
Beverage segment generated 12% of pro forma Net sales for the combined Solenis company for the twelve months
ended March 31, 2023.

_Customers_

We serve a large base of customers across a diverse set of end markets. Our customer base for the
combined company includes many of the top paper and industrial players across our Industrial Solutions and
Consumer Solutions segments, including WestRock, International Paper, and Marathon Petroleum, across big-box
retailers such as Wal-Mart and Leslie’s Poolmart in our Pool Solutions segment, across Compass, ISS and
McDonald’s in our Institutional Solutions segment and across PepsiCo and Nestle in our Food & Beverage segment.
We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will further reduce customer concentration. For the twelve
months ended March 31, 2023, the top ten customers for the combined company represent approximately 12% of
total pro forma combined company Net sales with the largest customer representing approximately 2% of pro forma
combined company Net sales. As of March 31, 2023, at Solenis, the top ten customers represented approximately
19% of total Net sales with the top three customers representing approximately 11%. Historically, large accounts
have grown 1.3x faster than the base business, driven by collaboration with customers on new technology
development, embedded service engineers and focus on consistent delivery and service. As of March 31, 2023 at
Diversey, customer concentration was relatively in line with that of Solenis so low customer concentration is set to
become even less concentrated as a result of the combination of Solenis and Diversey. Further, Diversey is a major
global player with capabilities to serve GSAs, which represents approximately 20% of revenue. Both Solenis and
Diversey have long-tenured, diverse and high quality customer relationships.

We believe our customer base is inherently sticky, attributable to the mission critical nature and service-led
models that Solenis and Diversey provide, leading to highly recurring, non-discretionary spend on products and
services. On-site technicians, employees and equipment at customer locations create high switching costs and
disruption risk. As a result, we believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately 97% recurring, driven by our
differentiated solutions and value proposition and will continue to remain over 97% recurring in the combined
company.

_Suppliers & Procurement_

We source materials from multiple suppliers creating low supply chain concentration. On April 30, 2021,
Solenis and BASF agreed to extend the supply agreements applicable to certain products that are critical to Solenis’
supply chain and for which Solenis takes all of BASF’s production, which now will not expire until November
2028. Our largest raw material spend includes General Liquids (5.4% of total spend), Caustic and Chlorine (3.3% of
total spend), Acrylonitrile (2.9% of total spend), HDPE (2.2% of total spend) and Sodium Hydroxide (2.1% of total
spend) resulting in a top five materials of 15.9% or $590 million. The top five key suppliers represent 23% of total
expenditure, or $854 million, with the top supplier representing 13% of total expenditure.

The following graphic summarizes our pro forma combined company expenditure on raw materials and to
key suppliers for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023.

###### Raw Materials Key Suppliers

**Industry Overview**

**_Specialty Chemicals – Consumer_**

The Consumer market is comprised of water treatment chemicals and solutions for pulp and paper specific
process applications (e.g., strength additives and sizing agents across wet-end/dry-end of paper process). Based on a
report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, the global Consumer market was estimated to be
approximately $8 billion in 2020.

The Packaging market is one of the key market segments within the Consumer market that can be broken
into consumer packaging and food packaging. Based on the same report, the Consumer packaging market was
estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 3.4% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030,
which we believe will be driven primarily from the growth of e-commerce and megatrends in pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics and beauty. Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023
was generated from the consumer packaging market. Based on the same report, the food packaging market was
estimated to be $1.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030
(including food packaging barrier film expected to grow at a 4.7% CAGR), driven by increased demand for
ecofriendly packaging and changing lifestyles centering on more take-away and individually packed food. We
believe the shift away from plastic and the growth in the barrier coating market, which is not included in the market
size estimate, may drive additional growth in food packaging over this period. Approximately 7% of our pro forma
Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the food packaging and molded fiber
packaging market.

The Graphic & Specialty Paper market has been adversely impacted by the continued substitution of
printed material with electronic media. Reduced use of commercial office spaces in Europe and North America as a
result of COVID-19 is also a negative factor for the sector outlook. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market, based on
the same report, was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to decline at a 0.9% CAGR for the ten-year
period from 2020 to 2030. However, we have limited exposure to newsprint, which accounts for approximately
2.5% of Consumer Solutions sales, and we are shifting our focus to higher margin products to offset the expected
volume decline in this market. Approximately 5% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31,
2023 was generated from the Graphic & Specialty Paper market.

The Tissue & Towel market is benefiting from strong demographic/socioeconomic trends and increasing
hygiene standards, especially in developing markets. However, stagnating population growth in some mature
markets, and cost-cutting in the public sector and private company spending is expected to limit global market
growth. The Tissue & Towel market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2020 and is
expected to grow at a 2.6% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030. Approximately 6% of our pro forma Net
sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the Tissue & Towel market.

**_Specialty Chemicals — Industrial_**

The industrial market supplies water treatment chemicals and solutions for heavy and light industries and
municipalities (e.g., cooling tower, boiler, influent/effluent, process water). Broadly speaking, the industrial market

184


-----

consists of core water treatment which includes end markets such as pulp, mining and oil and gas, and wastewater,
which includes end markets such as municipal and industrial wastewater markets.

Based on the same report, the global industrial market was estimated to be approximately $23 billion in
2020 and is expected to grow at a 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025 for both the wastewater and
core water treatment markets. The municipal market is expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR for the five-year period
from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report, as demand continues to increase from higher per capita usage of water,
population growth and increasing regulatory demands. Growth in the core water treatment market, including both
heavy and light industrial markets, is expected to be driven by increasing sustainability and environmental policies,
growing regulatory demands and global industrial growth. This growth is expected to be highest in the food and
beverage market (5.5% CAGR for the five year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report) and the
refining and petrochemicals market (4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same
report). Approximately 20% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated
from the Industrial market.

**_Pool_**

The aftermarket for the residential pool industry is comprised of three main segments: (1) Chemicals, (2)
Equipment, Parts, and Accessories and (3) Services. Our main focus is on the Chemicals segment which is the
largest and most stable component of aftermarket pool spend.

Pool chemicals sales are tied to: (1) the pool installed base and (2) total gallons of treatable water, and not
new builds. The U.S. pool installed base has displayed long-term stability as it has consistently grown for decades,
including all years through the housing-led recession and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is
providing current tailwinds for the business. As of December 31, 2022, the installed base of U.S. in ground pools
was 9 million, based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. However, new builds
account for less than 4% of the installed base annually, meaning that new build rates are unlikely to materially
impact our long-term performance.

The Pool Solutions segment also benefits from a stable aftermarket spend that mirrors the steady dynamic
of the installed base. Our chemical-based products result in 100% aftermarket exposure, which reduces our exposure
to cyclical industry trends such as housing starts. Pool chemical use is entirely non-discretionary in that it is a
requirement for owning and using a pool. Pool owners who have already made the significant upfront investment of
constructing a pool, estimated to cost $40,000 to $100,000, will continue to purchase pool chemicals, at the de
minimis annual expense of $300 to $400 in order to maintain their pools.

The pool chemical treatment market includes products such as primary sanitizers (71% of total market
sales), specialty chemicals, other shocks and alternative sanitizers. Primary sanitizers include cal-hypo, sodium
hypochlorite (“sodium-hypo”), trichlor, dichlor and packaged shocks. The total market for U.S. residential pool
chemicals, based on retail dollar value, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2020 and grew by 28% in 2021 to
approximately $3.4 billion, primarily due to higher prices resulting from scarcity of chlorine based on a recent study
by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We believe the U.S. residential pool chemical market, on a
volume basis, will exceed the expected growth of the installed base of U.S. residential pools, which was estimated to
be 3.0% from 2020 to 2025 based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We
further believe that volumes in our pool solutions segment will exceed the market as we expand our customer base
and increase market sale with new dealer relationships and e-commerce.

**_Institutional_**

The Institutional Solutions market growth is driven by an aging population, increasing demand for
healthcare facilities, return to office policies continued to drive an increase demand for cleaning, the introduction of
new sanitization standards arising post-COVID and a focus on new infrastructure bills to expand healthcare and
transportation networks. Based on a third-party report completed in February 2023, the Institutional Solutions
segment is growing at a CAGR of 5.3% for the four year period 2022 to 2026. The manufacturing and commercial
and healthcare and hospitality sub-end markets are expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively, for
the four year period 2022 to 2026.

(4) Note: Based on data from an expert third-party advisor.

**_Food & Beverage_**

The Food & Beverage market growth is driven by an increase in governmental concerns over food safety
and oversight driving increased regulation, shifting consumer preferences in (1) mature markets, towards organic
and simple and (2) in emerging markets, towards more processed foods and a growing global population driving
increased consumption of food and beverage. Based on a third-party report completed in February 2023, the Food &
Beverage segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.5% for the four year period 2022 to 2026.

**_Competitive Landscape_**

_Consumer Solutions_

We believe, based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, that we are the
market leader in specialty chemicals for the Consumer Solutions segment. Based on the same report, we believe that
we maintain market leadership positions in almost all technologies and regions. The competitive landscape, as

process chemicals within the biocide, contaminant control, defoamer, tissue specialties and pulp specialties
technologies.

Our strength is based on the complete product portfolio, premium product performance and strong technical
support we offer. We believe we have the best and the broadest offering to help customers achieve their operational
efficiencies. We are a trusted supplier known for our data analytics capacities, with a focus on service excellence,
sustainability, productivity and cost savings for our customers.

Many customers are starting to embrace digital technology / data analytics to help track performance and
starting to partner with suppliers with strong R&D capabilities to develop innovative solutions to drive efficiency
and achieve sustainability objectives. This trend is expected to continue and we expect to benefit from it due to our
robust value-added chemistry and technology solutions offering.

_Industrial Solutions_

The global industrial water chemicals market is fragmented, with the top seven players, based on a report
by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021. This is due to the required application-specific expertise and
track-record of performance. Hence, by region and by end-user market, three to five players may have a
disproportionately high share. We believe we have an outsized share of the global pulp and paper market, which is
one of our larger markets within the Industrial Solutions segment.

We believe we offer the lowest per unit cost for comparable chemicals compared to our industry peers and
believe that the competitive pricing is our greatest strength in the Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we
offer an array of innovative solutions and comprehensive product lines both in core water treatment and wastewater
segment. Notable competitors include Ecolab / Nalco, Suez, ChemTreat, Kurita, Kemira and SNF. Ecolab, which
acquired Nalco in 2011, is the largest water treatment player followed by Suez.

Similar to the Consumer market, technology and R&D are becoming increasingly important beyond the
chemical product itself as customers are moving towards advanced analytics to optimize the volume of chemical
treatment, driving select industry participants to increasingly focus on equipment / engineering solutions as opposed
to chemical solutions.

_Pool Solutions_

We believe we are the only true global player in the Pool Solutions segment with leading market positions
in North America, South America, and EMEA. We believe the acquisition of Clearon further enhanced our market
leading position. Our primary competitor in this segment is KIK Custom Products, which provides various pool
chemical solutions, with a focus on North America. Other smaller competitors also compete in this market, with
varying breadth and geographical focus, including Hasa Pool, Jandy, Lo-chlor and Jack’s Magic.

We believe we are the world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment
and sanitation. All three of our cal-hypo facilities are co-located with chlor-alkali producers meaning that raw
materials (chlorine and caustic soda) are delivered into our production plants via a direct pipeline. We believe this is
a major competitive advantage and barrier to entry in the Pool Solutions segment as we believe it would not be
economical for our competitors to open a new cal-hypo facility that is not co-located with a supply of raw materials.

The acquisition of Clearon provided additional manufacturing capabilities for trichlor and dichlor and we
are now the only producer of cal-hypo, trichlor and dichlor, which we believe will give us a significant advantage
over our competitors. Further, Clearon’s manufacturing facility located in West Virginia was isolated from the
impact of natural disasters that other competitors have experienced with facilities located on the Gulf Coast.

_Institutional Solutions_

Diversey is a major global player in the Institutional Solutions segment and competes primarily with
Ecolab. Other competitors in this segment include: SC Johnson, Gojo, Kalykim and Jasol. In this highly fragmented
market, Diversey and Ecolab together hold approximately a 20% global market share. Geographically, Diversey
believes it is the number one or number two player in the North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin
America and Asia-Pacific regions. Other competitors are focused on niche segments and geographies, focusing on
regional and local customers.

188


-----

Diversey is positioned to compete using a recurring revenue business model built on consumable products
that require periodic replacement and high customer switching costs via a suite of proprietary dosing and dispensing
equipment installed at customer sites. Further, to better compete with Ecolab in North America, Diversey is in the
process of opening a new co-manufacturing / co-warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky, alongside consolidating
certain existing service centers to increase manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities.

After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be better positioned to compete with Ecolab
for leadership across all markets. We believe that the combined company is best positioned to capture share on a
global scale due to Diversey’s strong existing market position, combined with our own position and track record of
sustained growth and the white space afforded by such a fragmented market.

_Food & Beverage_

Diversey is one of the only two global players in the Food & Beverage segment and competes primarily
with Ecolab. The Food & Beverage market is largely consolidated and Diversey and Ecolab together hold
approximately half of the global market share. Ecolab and Diversey generally compete within cleaning and hygiene
solutions. Other, smaller competitors exist including Zep, Reckitt and Kersia. These players tend to service more
regional markets and operate with highly limited product and distribution capabilities.

Prior to the Transactions, we entered into a distribution relationship with Diversey through which we
provide water treatment products to be marketed to Diversey’s existing customer base within its Food & Beverage
segment. This current offering sets Diversey apart from Ecolab and represents an opportunity for additional market
capture and cross-selling in the future following the consummation of the Transactions.

**_Sustainability and Environmental and Social Governance_**

We drive sustainability by reducing water and energy use and raw materials waste while improving
operational productivity. Increased focus on sustainability and ESG is a key trend across both Consumer Solutions
and Industrial Solutions segments and is driving demand as our customers aim to reduce water and energy
consumption, optimize raw materials spend and reduce waste emission. These objectives require increased chemical
use which is driving increased demand for our business. Institutional products are designed to enhance cleanliness,
safety, environmental sustainability, and efficiency needed to serve our customers in the healthcare, education, food
service, retail and grocery, hospitality, and building service contractor industries. Food & Beverage solutions will
maximize food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability for our customers in the brewing, beverage, dairy,
processed foods, pharmaceutical and agriculture industries.

At the micro level, we provide solutions to customers with specific sustainability goals. For example, our
offering of PFAS-free oil and grease resistant technology has been selected by major brand owners as a replacement
in food service bowls. We also made a series of recommendations to a chemical company which resulted in a
reduction of 28,000 cubic meters of water per year and 3,000 tons of CO2 emissions. The resulting savings for our
customer were approximately $27 million per year. Further, our cal-hypo-based shocks that are sold at big-box
retailers eliminate the need to drain and refill pools due to over stabilization, resulting in potential water savings of
up to 600 gallons per pound used instead of dichlor and we estimate approximate water savings of up to 25 billion
gallons per year. Diversey’s Clax® Advanced laundry solution supports clean and bright laundry at low wash
temperatures to lower operational costs and reduce its customers’ environmental impact. Further, its delivers

**Summary of Operational Improvements and Synergies Initiatives related to the Acquisition**

We, along with Platinum, have identified expected synergies resulting from the Transactions. We identified
an estimated $205 million in net annual cost synergies expected to be implemented within 24 months of closing the
Transactions which are expected to be realized through consolidation of support and sales functions, materials
sourcing consolidation and facility consolidation, as follows:

    - Approximately $97 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved through organizational
design opportunities via consolidation of Diversey’s back office into Solenis’ across the finance,
information technology, human resources, legal, environmental, health and safety, commercial,
research and development and marketing functions. The foregoing includes $51 million in optimizing
overall organizational structure and number of employees for key functions, $33 million in elimination
of redundant leadership positions and management roles and $14 million for the leveraging of existing
shared service centers across the combined company.

    - Approximately $44 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved related to direct and indirect
sourcing opportunities, including $30 million related to leveraging combined chemicals and
commodities spend and higher purchasing power to drive more favorable contracts by both product
type and supplier and $13 million related to leveraging combined indirect spend categories with
supplier rationalization to reduce fragmentation and tail spend in certain categories, consolidation of
technologies, and telecom, network and data center optimization.

    - Approximately $64 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved through manufacturing and
distribution center optimization and consolidation, transportation logistics efficiencies and real estate
consolidation, including $23 million related to consolidating overlapping footprints and removing
excess capacity, $37 million related to optimizing outbound transportation based on facility
consolidation and production shifts between plants to optimize shipping networks to nearest point of
origin, procuring freight more effectively and improving contract compliance, and $5 million related to
optimizing office footprint to reduce redundancies, underutilized office space by renegotiating leases
and eliminating smaller offices with little to no headcount by converting to remote work or providing
alternative locations.

To achieve the identified synergies, we expect to incur approximately $190 million in total of one-time
costs related to severance, retention, information technology system integration and consulting, among other costs.

The initiatives to realize the Transactions synergies have and will be executed by a dedicated
implementation team with support from Platinum operational executives and third-party resources. However, there
can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these synergies or operational improvements. For more
information about our anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may affect our ability to achieve such
synergies or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Legacy

**Summary of Operational Improvements and Synergies Initiatives related to the Legacy Acquisitions**

We, along with Platinum, identified synergies resulting from the Solenis Acquisition. We achieved $40
million in annual cost synergies from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing
Date.

We, along with Platinum, also identified expected synergies resulting from the Clearon Acquisition. We
identified an estimated $13 million in net annual cost synergies from actions taken or expected to be taken within 24
months of closing the Clearon Acquisition. As of March 31, 2023, we have achieved $6.5 million and expect to
achieve $6.5 million from actions taken to date or to be taken in the next 15 months. These synergies are expected to
be realized through headcount rationalization and non-labor optimization spend net of certain incremental expenses.

The initiatives to realize both the Solenis Acquisition and Clearon Acquisition synergies have and will
continue to be executed by a dedicated implementation team with support from Platinum operational executives and
third-party resources. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the remaining synergies or
operational improvements. For more information about our anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may

**_Global Leader with Diverse Sticky Customer Base_**

After giving effect to the Transactions, we will have a large geographical footprint that enables us to
provide global service to our customers. We are present on six continents, with both laboratories and production
facilities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve all major developed markets. After giving effect
to the Transactions, we will have approximately 15,600 employees with a substantial presence across the North
Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. Our strategic global footprint allows us to efficiently and effectively serve
customers around the world by providing consistent products and service. Diversey offers further expansion
opportunities, particular given by its strength in EMEA.

Our service and technical abilities are mission critical to our customers. Typically our trained value-add
employees, scientists, and service engineers are embedded at customers’ sites, creating strong and long-term
relationships. We represent a lower overall percentage of our customers’ cost base and have been able to achieve
significant value add documented savings for our customers. We are highly engrained in our customers’ workflow,
and it is often difficult, expensive, and potentially disruptive for customers to switch to a competitor. As a result, we
believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately 97% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and value
proposition and will continue to remain over 97% recurring in the combined company. After giving effect to the
Transactions, the top ten customers for the combined company are expected to represent approximately 12% of total
Net sales with the largest customer representing approximately 2% of the combined company Net sales.

**_Differentiated Business Model with Best in Class Service, Chemistry, and Technology_**

We believe our suite of comprehensive products and services unlocks customer value as a result of our
industry leading employees and innovative technology offerings. Our solutions represent a small portion of our
customers’ overall end costs and provide a significant return on investment. Our differentiated service model, with
approximately 2,400 of our sales and service engineers on site with our customers, leads to highly recurring, nondiscretionary spending on our products and services, and with our solutions and value propositions including
industry leading technology and equipment and artificial intelligence abilities, Solenis was able to achieve $179
million of value-add documented savings for our customers in the twelve months ended September 30, 2022.

We offer innovative chemistries to address customers’ operational and sustainability challenges while our
technology is at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry. Further, we have product
development capabilities to meet customers’ new and evolving needs, based on three main pillars. First, we have
approximately 270 dedicated research and development professionals with two-thirds of our annual technology
spend supporting those efforts. Second, our innovation pipeline includes approximately 47 projects, representing
significant potential run-rate revenue, and features approximately 4,130 patents, including patents for chemical and
equipment technologies. In total, Solenis has 2,259 patents issued and 613 patents currently pending, while Diversey
has 1,108 patents issued and 150 patents currently pending. Lastly, our strategically located facilities around the
world focus on analyzing and diagnosing products and processes, as well as conducting testing to recommend
effective improvements that enhance both productivity and quality for our customers. This is critical as new and
innovative products carry a higher than average margin and this mix shift is expected to drive increased profitability
for our business.

**_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Top Line Growth, Expanding Margins, and Robust Free Cash Flow_**
**_Generation_**

Our global business has shown strong topline growth, and we believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately
97% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and value proposition and will continue to remain over 97%
recurring in the combined company, with the core business growing during the COVID-19 pandemic. By optimizing
our cost structure through a strict focus on maximizing operational efficiencies using new technologies, reducing
redundancies and leveraging existing infrastructure, we have seen improved Adjusted EBITDA growth and
attractive margin expansion. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) margin was approximately 18%. Our topline growth and
price increases offsetting inflation along with low working capital intensity and minimal capital expenditures allow
for significant free cash flow generation. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial
Data.”

**_Long Tenured, Industry Leading Management Team with Strong Track Record_**

We have an experienced management team with long tenures in the industry and experience in the sector,
which has been recognized as a US Best Managed Company by Deloitte and The Wall Street Journal for 2021, 2022
and 2023. We are led by John E. Panichella, who has been CEO of Solenis since its inception in 2014, following the
initial carve-out from Ashland. Through organic growth and M&A, particularly the merger with BASF, Panichella
has steered Solenis to global leadership in the specialty chemicals for water-intensive industries. Prior to leading
Solenis, John served as President of AWT, SVP of Ashland, Group Operating Officer of Ashland Specialty
Ingredients and AWT, and President of Ashland Aqualon Functional ingredients. Surrounding John is a deep bench
across operations, technology, commercial and finance, including Philip M. Patterson, Jr, our CFO, Edward
Connors, President of the Americas, Jacques Herber, President of Eurasia, and Robert Baird, President of the Pool
Solutions business. Our experienced team will drive long-term stability of the business and support future growth.

**Growth Strategy**

We believe we are well positioned to grow organically and capture share through several distinct strategies.
Supportive end market trends that drove historical growth are expected to continue over the next five to ten years.
We have successfully maintained strong pricing discipline to offset inflationary increases to input costs and shift
customers to a more profitable mix, driving margin growth. The combination creates unique, value accretive
synergy opportunities, with line of sight on approximately $205 million of estimated cost synergies (resulting from
actions expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions). Additionally, we achieved $40
million of cost synergies related to the Solenis Acquisition from actions that were taken within 18 months of the
Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and we identified $13 million of cost synergies related to the Clearon Acquisition
which are expected to be realized from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24 months of the
Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. As of March 31, 2023, we have realized $6.5 million of cost synergies related to
the Clearon Acquisition.

We are also well positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions via multiple M&A avenues. We have
a proven track record as an M&A platform, with 17 transactions completed since 2014, including the transformative
fiscal year 2019 merger with BASF’s water and paper business and the Solenis Acquisition in fiscal year 2022. We
believe there is an opportunity for both strategic bolt-ons and transformational targets going forward.

**_Well Positioned to Grow with Macro and ESG Mega Trends_**

We believe our sophisticated product development capabilities meet our customers’ evolving needs and
help keep us at the forefront of macroeconomic trends. Our ability to evolve is based on three pillars that allow us to
grow our product offering alongside client demands: R&D, Innovation and Customer Application Laboratories. Our
R&D team has approximately 270 dedicated professionals and two thirds of annual technology investment supports
R&D. Our robust innovation pipeline currently has approximately 47 projects and features approximately 4,130
patents, including those for chemical and equipment technologies. In total we have 3,367 patents issued and 763
patents currently pending. Customer application laboratories are strategically located facilities around the world
focused on analyzing and diagnosing products and processes, as well as conducting testing to recommend effective
improvements that enhance both productivity and quality.

We focus on solving our customers’ environmental and sustainability challenges, placing us at the forefront
of the ESG mega trend. Through identification of specific goals such as reduction of water consumption, reduction
of energy consumption, reduction of waste emissions or optimization of raw materials utilization, we have been able
to work with customers to meet their unique needs. Our sophisticated capabilities have helped customers meet
evolving sustainability goals and achieve measurable results.

**_Pricing Discipline to Drive Margin Growth_**

We have a track-record of actively monitoring and managing prices, enabling the pass-through of raw
material cost increases to maintain margins. Through Solenis’ value-documentation program, sales teams have
accountability requirements to show that at least 5% of Net sales deliver a value advantage to customers, which
enables price capture even in deflationary environments. This has enabled us to pass through a majority of increases
in raw chemical materials, which are one of the major drivers for cost inflation, to customers by adjusting prices
accordingly. We began to see a significant increase in the price of our raw materials, including ethylene and
propylene, during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and we began to pass on price increases to our
customers. Typically, we experience an approximately 90-day lag in implementing our price increases, however,
during the six months ended March 31, 2023, we exceeded our goals and were able to drive price increases even
faster with price exceeding cost during the six months ended March 31, 2023 in all of our business segments.

While Diversey continues to adjust prices to pass through increases in raw materials costs, Diversey was
slower to react to the inflationary cost environment than Solenis, which resulted in more pronounced margin
compression throughout 2022 than Solenis. Once combined, Diversey’s performance is expected to improve as they
will operate on Solenis’ value-documentation program. Typically, Diversey experiences an approximately 90-day
lag in implementing our price increases, however, during the six months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey exceeded
its goals and was able to drive price increases even faster with Cost of goods sold inflation during the six months
ended March 31, 2023 in its Institutional Solutions and Food & Beverage segments.

The charts below summarize our and Diversey’s success in implementing price increases and maintaining
price ahead of cost.

**_Enhance Profitability Through Identified Synergies and Operational Improvements_**

We believe that through the realization of the synergies and operational improvement initiatives, which we
have identified together with Platinum, we will enhance our profitability and support our strategic initiatives. The
approximately $205 million of synergies was identified with the collaboration of the Solenis and Diversey
management teams, along with Platinum, and reflect actions which we believe can be implemented within 24
months of the closing of the Transactions. The Platinum team has an extensive track record of leveraging our
operational resources to achieve anticipated cost savings.

We cannot assure you we will be able to achieve all of these cost synergies. For more information about
our anticipated cost synergies and operational improvements, including certain factors that may affect our ability to
achieve such cost synergies and operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and
the Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the
adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies
and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the
Acquisition and Related Synergies).”

and should not be read to do so.

**_Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions_**

While our primary focus is on organic growth, our global presence, scale and broad product offering
position us well to execute on opportunistic acquisitions given the large and fragmented nature of the markets we
serve or to expand into new markets. We estimate that the markets adjacent to our market represent a total market
size of $42 billion and represent potential expansion areas, including the ion exchange and coagulants markets. We
believe that we can create significant value through strategic acquisitions given our track record of integration.
Solenis has completed 17 acquisitions since 2014, including the transformative and successful merger with BASF’s
water and paper business in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and the Solenis Acquisition in fiscal year
2022. We will focus on maintaining a disciplined acquisition strategy centered on: (i) expanding our customer base
in new and growing end markets and geographies; (ii) improving our customer offering through access to new
products and technological capabilities; and (iii) generating significant purchasing and other operational synergies.

196

The graphic below sets forth a summary of our acquisitions since 2014.

**_Strategically Invest in High Return Capital Expenditures Expansion_**

Our key capital expenditure projects include production capacity expansion for polyvinyl amine (“PVAM”)
at our Suffolk, Virginia facility and calcium hypochlorite (cal-hypo) at our Charleston, Tennessee and Kempton
Park, South Africa facilities. Our expansion efforts will eliminate existing capacity constraints and better position us
to capitalize on customer demand for these high-margin products. Our engineering estimates for all facilities are
underway with expansion efforts expected to be online in 2026. We expect the PVAM and cal-hypo expansions to
cost $150 million and $100 million, respectively.

A majority of our customers, especially those producing packaging and tissue and towel products, are
focused on improving strength. We are a market leader in strength chemistry, with the broadest portfolio of synthetic
strength additives like PVAM and are the leading supplier of global PVAM production. Previously PVAM was
originally sold by BASF and we acquired full commercial rights as part of 2019 merger. However, in advance of the
merger, BASF raised prices substantially, resulting in lost sales. Post integration, we refilled the pipeline and
returned the product to growth, however, in recent years, our PVAM volumes have been constrained despite
debottlenecking programs implemented and we have been unable to return to pre-BASF merger levels. Further, in
fiscal year 2022, we experienced shutdowns and product issues resulting in production allocation and customer
management challenges. To solve our capacity constraint, we are looking to build incremental capacity at our
existing Suffolk, Virginia facility, which is expected to be online by the end of 2026 that will enable us to increase
capacity by approximately 100%.

Cal-hypo is a highly concentrated source of chlorine in solid form and is a cost-effective solution primarily
used for pool sanitization and maintenance with secondary uses to disinfect water in industrial and municipal
markets. Our Solenis HTH[ TM] and Poolife[TM] offerings are cal-hypo-based shocks that eliminate the need to drain and
refill pools due to over stabilization with other benefits including minimized storage requirements, dry formulation
for shelf stability and easy handling, reduced shipping and handling costs and reduced maintenance. We are
currently experiencing capacity constraints at our Kempton Park, South Africa facility. Further, given over 50% of
global supply is produced in either China or India, importing incremental capacity is both challenging and costly.
Due to these constraints, we are looking to expand our capacity. Expansion efforts at our Kempton Park facility are
underway and are expected to be completed by fiscal year ended 2023 or 2024. Further, we are pursuing a site
selection process for additional capacity including assessing potential new locations, with the expectation that all
facilities will be online by 2026. In the interim, we will look to temporarily source incremental capacity via third
parties to pre-seed the plant which we believe will drive top line growth in the near team and insourcing savings in
the future. Following its return to the United States market, Diversey’s current management team identified potential

manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities by re-positioning and consolidating certain
existing service centers. This supply chain improvement process is referred to as “Project Mega.”

Project Mega includes a largely complete consolidation of the North American supply chain footprint
through the creation of a manufacturing plant and co-located warehouse in Northern Kentucky, as well as warehouse
consolidation in Europe. Diversey started shipping from the new Kentucky warehouse in July 2022 and is
consolidating its manufacturing capabilities into the same Kentucky facility. Further, Project Mega is consolidating
five Diversey (three Institutional and two Food & Beverage) plants into four plants (two Institutional and two Food
& Beverage) and is planning on closing two Wisconsin plants. By co-locating its main warehouse and
manufacturing capabilities, and adding more capacity to bring currently contracted volumes in-house and optimizing
freight lanes, the project is expected to drive approximately $30 million of annual cost savings. The run rate cost
savings includes $11 million related to manufacturing efficiencies from increased insourcing from contract
manufacturers, more efficient lines and fixed absorption, co-location of liquid manufacturing and wipes conversion
and an optimized flow of processes, $10 million related to logistics and the ability to avoid shipping between sites
along with having new sites closer to suppliers and customers, $7 million related to direct savings achieved from
materials sourcing using larger orders (i.e. from drums to bulk orders), $1 million related to warehousing from lower
rent and co-locating with manufacturing and $2 million related to other.

**Historical Business Segmentation**

**_Solenis_**

Since the joint venture arrangement with BASF in January 2019, Solenis’ business has principally
consisted of three operating segments: Pulp & Paper, Industrial Water, and Reverse Supply Agreements.

**_Pulp & Paper. The Pulp & Paper (“P&P”) business manufactures and sells a broad array of process_**

**Prior/2021 Business Resegmentation**

Following a strategic review related to Solenis’ operating segments and in anticipation of the closing of the
Solenis Acquisition, changes were introduced in the segment reporting from October 1, 2021 onwards.

The segmentation changes were made for the following reasons: (i) to align the segment structure to ensure
that our financial reporting segments are in line with its strategic approach in demarcating its operations and (ii) to
manage the business and make business decisions based on product lines and services in the most effective manner.

Major changes to highlight included: (i) the creation of a new Pool Solutions segment to account for the
contribution of Sigura’s Pools segment, focused on delivering products for the treatment of pools, spas and water

parks, (ii) the renaming of the Pulp & Paper business as the Consumer Solutions business, (iii) the renaming of the
Industrial Water business as the Industrial Solutions business, (iv) the reallocation of the food processing aspects of
the business from the newly named Industrial Solutions business to sit with the other consumer-based products and
services within the newly named Consumer Solutions business, (v) the reallocation of the pulp processing aspects of
the business from the newly named Consumer Solutions business to sit with the other industrial-focused products
and services within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment, (vi) the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial &
Municipal Water business to the newly named Industrial Solutions segment and (vii) the inclusion of Solenis’ RSA
business within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment.

**_Consumer Solutions._** The Pulp & Paper segment of the historical Solenis business was renamed as the
Consumer Solutions segment. The Consumer Solutions segment is mostly affected by the removal of Pulp and its
reallocation to the Industrial Water segment (now renamed as the Industrial Solutions segment).

**_Industrial Solutions._** The Industrial Water segment of the historical Solenis business was renamed as the
Industrial Solutions segment. The Industrial Solutions segment is mostly affected by the inclusion of the RSA
segment, the removal of Food and its reallocation to the Pulp & Paper segment (now renamed the Consumer
Solutions segment) and the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial & Municipal business.

**_Pool Solutions._** Sigura’s Pool segment, including residential and commercial pools, forms the new Pool
Solutions business segment.

**Sustainability Strategy**

Global demand for solutions that save water, use less energy, eliminate waste, and convert everyday
products to more sustainable materials is continuing to grow. As a leader in sustainability, Solenis has been helping
its customers tackle these complex challenges for more than 100 years.

Global trends show that sustainability strategies are becoming strong differentiators for businesses and that
stakeholders are increasingly interested in how key ESG issues are managed. ESG covers a broad set of issues, from
the carbon dioxide footprint to labor practices to corruption. Consumers and employees are demanding higher
standards of sustainability and quality of employment. Regulators and policy-makers are also interested in
sustainability, and they see the corporate sector as a key player in the journey toward achieving sustainable
development.

One of the most relevant environmental issues for the chemical industry is the management of water
resources. As freshwater sources like rivers or lake become increasingly stressed, the chemical industry is working
with other sectors to increase water efficiency and to reduce water use in their operations and value chain.
Businesses are also investing in recycling technologies, as well as incorporating renewable and recyclable materials
in their product portfolio.

With a water treatment heritage of more than a century, helping customers meet their environmental goals
has always been one of the company’s highest priorities.

In 2020, with a view to advancing our sustainability goals and commitments, we carried out a materiality
assessment to identify the most material topics to stakeholders and the business. The aim was to identify ways to
enhance the company’s existing sustainability efforts, improve transparency and disclosure, look for more
opportunities to drive sustainable solutions and improve operational efficiency and productivity. Although involved
in numerous sustainability initiatives for many years, the materiality assessment helped to inform the development
of the company’s strategic sustainability approach going forward, organizing its actions and commitments across
four focus areas:

**_Wellbeing, Health & Safety of Our People. Our long-standing reputation for solving highly complex_**
customer challenges is directly attributed to our approximately 15,600 outstanding professionals, including 2,400
field representatives, working in 41 countries across five continents. It is our ambition to educate and engage our
employees to reach their full potential and to create a safe and inclusive work environment in which they can
continuously grow and succeed, and this is prioritized in our approach to culture, health and safety, diversity and
inclusion, and training and development.

**_Protecting our Planet. In our operations, our focus is on ensuring responsible stewardship of the natural_**
environment, by focusing on climate change and energy use initiatives, supporting circular economy and material

200


-----

use principles (increasing the contribution of recycled materials to overall materials demand), promoting water
management and waste and pollution management and enabling our customers to manage resources and
manufacturing processes more effectively. This includes continuing to ensure that all our sites meet, or exceed, all
regulatory and environmental requirements, keeping abreast of changing applicable environmental laws and
regulations, and providing products and services to our customers to help them meet, or exceed, their own
environmental objectives.

**_Partnerships in Our Value Chain. Given our global reach, we recognize our responsibility towards_**
employees, customers, suppliers, governments, investors and the local communities of which we are part. We are
dedicated to responsibly managing relationships with our key stakeholders. An important element of this is
partnering with employees to help address the needs of the communities where we operate and collaborating with
our suppliers to increase transparency and sustainability in our supply chain.

**_Responsible Business Practices. We focus on operating with the highest ethical standards in all aspects of_**
our business and protecting the rights and interests of all our stakeholders, individually and collectively. We treat
personal data confidentially, adhering to effective policies and procedures securing lawfulness, fairness,
transparency, integrity and confidentiality of personal data entrusted to Solenis by our employees, customers,
suppliers, business partners and other individuals with whom we work. We are recognized globally for our legacy of
technology innovation and we invest in developing new chemistries to improve customers’ products and processes.
In 2020, Solenis embarked on a digital transformation effort focused on enhancing the customer experience using
digital solutions.

Our ambition for the future is to create more value for all our stakeholders while consuming less, thereby
minimizing our impact on the environment and society. Supporting our customers in their sustainability journeys
will always be central to our business. However, going forward we will also look inward, with a focus on
consumption reduction and on product development with sustainability at its core.

Following completion of the Transactions, the Diversey business will be integrated into these sustainability
goals and commitments.

**Impact of COVID-19**

Although the COVID-19 pandemic presented us with many hurdles to overcome, we achieved considerable
business successes through our business agility and creative approaches to solving customer problems. During the
pandemic, the business remained strong, owing to the essential markets we serve, which include consumer
packaging, tissue and towel, municipal and many other essential goods producers. These customers have ongoing
needs for products and services to protect water and production assets. For consumer-related manufacturing, such as
bath tissue and packaging for e-commerce, our customers increased production significantly in response to demand
driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences.

In addition, COVID-19 has accelerated and driven many trends and changing behaviors globally, one of
which is the concept of “cocooning.” This has resulted in a greater focus on the home environment, which has
translated into increased residential pool builds in the North American and European geographies. Additionally,
greater focus on home entertainment and health has increased residential pool usage and maintenance, which has
positively impacted the demand for pool chemicals. A downside experienced from COVID-19 is the reduction in
tourism and travel, which has resulted in a negative impact on commercial pool usage and resulted in decreased
chemical usage in commercial pools.

Overall, we believe that the positive impact on residential pools chemical usage during the COVID-19
pandemic has outweighed the negative impact to the commercial pools chemicals usage.

We continued to observe strong market trends driving growth in sustainability, recycling, water reuse and
plastic conversion to fiber. We are moving numerous programs through our R&D processes to put new services and
products in the hands of our commercial team.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a meaningful impact on the Institutional Solutions segment being
contributed by Diversey. Beginning the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021,
strong demand for our infection prevention products and services offset volume related declines in sales to
restaurants, hotels and entertainment facilities. In the remainder of 2021 and into 2022, we saw restrictions and lockdowns start to ease in some markets, resulting in stronger than anticipated sales in those markets, except for

201


-----

infection prevention products. Sales of infection products normalized in the last three quarters of 2021 and in all of
2022.

As economies around the world reopened, increases in demand created significant disruptions to the global
supply chain during 2022, which affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs.
These supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors, including changes in supply
and demand, industry capacity constraints, raw material shortages and labor shortages. Global logistics network
challenges have resulted in delays, shortages of certain materials, and increased transportation costs. We have
materially mitigated to date the impact of these disruptions through the work of our procurement and supply chain
teams, but there continues to be significant uncertainties regarding the future impact of supply chain disruptions,
which we cannot predict. Additionally, we are in the process of consolidating certain facilities within North
America, which includes opening a new manufacturing and warehousing facility, which could present short-term
operational challenges and supply chain disruptions.

We are a diversified business in regards to both industry segments and global geographic regions. These
different aspects of our business are each impacted differently by COVID-19, supply chain disruptions and broader
economic conditions. Therefore, the recovery cycle and related timing will also be different for each segment and
region.

**Environmental Matters**

Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the
environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among
other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety.

Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regulate our products and often require us to
obtain pre-market approval of our products and comply with specified requirements. In the U.S., we must register
our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and products intended for
controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and processed foods with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
Such products are regulated in a similar way at the European Union level by the European Chemical Agency or by
member state competent authorities. Similar requirements exist in other countries such as China, Russia and South
Korea. To date, the cost of complying with such product registration requirements has not had a material adverse
effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We maintain reserves for any anticipated liabilities pertaining to environmental laws and regulations. The
total reserves for environmental remediation, reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an
extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to
any third-party recoveries. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that
affect our ability to estimate our share of any such costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of
contamination at any site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely
varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing
improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible
parties at multiparty sites.

As of March 31, 2023, Solenis had recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, related to
two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million relates
to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil.
The remaining $0.8 million relates to management’s best estimate for potential exposure related to ground
contamination at Solenis’ Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a potential Environmental Protection
Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management’s then-current best estimate of total
expenses to be incurred.

Diversey, similarly, is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and
accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated
that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are not reduced by potential insurance
recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that liability in excess of the amounts that have
been accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

202


-----

We are not currently aware of any other material environmental liabilities or other material environmental
issues at our properties or arising from our current operations. However, we cannot assure you that such liabilities or
issues will not materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations in the future.

We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe
that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a
material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition.

**Competition**

Our business competes on the basis of its demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, chemical
formulations, customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment.
Our principal competitors include Ecolab (Nalco), Kemira and SNF.

We believe that we are well positioned to compete in our markets. In particular, we believe our
differentiated product portfolio, with strong intellectual property, gives us a real competitive advantage. We
executed a clear strategy around several growth vectors, including corporate accounts, emerging markets, new
technologies, focused investment in water-intensive industries and polyacrylamide (PAM) manufacturing
capabilities investment — and all showed good returns.

Our scale provides a competitive benefit when compared with the smaller local or regional competitor
providers, as we are able to leverage our distribution network to service smaller customers in a cost-effective way.
We also differentiate from our competitors through (i) the breadth of our offering — we are a truly global player
with a full portfolio of water-intensive industry solutions, with best-in-class dosing and dispensing technologies and
advanced analytics to optimize the processes for the customer, (ii) our delivery of a total solution to customers —
operating as their trusted advisor in assessing operational efficiencies and leveraging our network of experts to solve
customers’ most difficult problems on a time-critical path through our fast track laboratories, (iii) our commitment
to constantly developing our portfolio to improve products, our development of new technologies to deliver
increased customer savings, and our addition of new product categories to meet more customer needs, and (iv) the
expertise of our workforce — who are highly trained in focused industries, and the majority of whom are embedded
in customer facilities.

**Personnel**

As of March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had approximately 15,600 employees
worldwide directly supporting our operations with approximately 3,919 employed in the United States. As of March
31, 2023, 184 of our employees in the United States, representing approximately 5% of our employees in the United
States, were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements are negotiated with
various unions representing our employees. Our employees are at the heart of our mission and strategies, and to
drive both, we focus on our culture.

**_Our Culture. Our mission is to strive to be each customer’s most trusted supplier. Our solutions drive_**
sustainability by reducing water and energy use and raw material waste while improving operational efficiency and
productivity. At its core, our focus is on profitable sustainability. Our culture is centered on fundamental beliefs
around the importance of our people, continuous performance improvement and creating positive experiences in our
interactions for every customer to fuel the growth of the business. Solenis brings together diverse perspectives in a
safe, collaborative workplace that empowers our employees to solve the world’s most challenging process and
sustainability challenges. We nurture a culture of inclusion and accountability and promote learning and
development of all employees.

**_Health & Safety. We continuously strive to be a leader in health and safety. Our long-term ambition is to_**
operate with zero injuries. To support this ambition, we have set a target to reduce our total recordable incident rate
by at least 10% versus the prior year.

**_Diversity & Inclusion. A diverse workforce is integral to deliver our strategy. By embracing the unique_**
strengths of each person and respecting and promoting differences, we believe that we can build the most effective
teams and enhance Solenis’ performance across our global operations. Our ambition is to double the number of
diverse people in the company by 2030.

203


-----

**_Training and Development. In addition to recognizing and rewarding our employees for their_**
achievements, we offer continuous learning and development opportunities. We proactively focus on creating
personalized development plans for every individual, ensuring that joining Solenis — and staying with us — leads
to a rewarding career that focuses on lifelong learning as well as personal and professional growth opportunities.

**Intellectual Property**

We strategically manage our portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other
intellectual property. Specifically, we rely upon trade secrets to protect the formulation of many of our chemical
products, as well as our manufacturing processes. We own or have licenses under patents and trademarks which are
used in connection with our business. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulations and
processes used to manufacture our products.

As of March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, we held 498 U.S. patents, 2,869 foreign
patents, and 85 U.S. and 678 foreign pending patent applications.

The trademarks of major products in each business are registered in key jurisdictions or licensed from third
parties. Certain intellectual property is also protected by confidentiality agreements or other agreements with
suppliers, employees and other third parties. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued
protection of these trademarks, patents and trade secrets.

The Diversey trademark and a select number of major sub-brands, including CLAX, SUMA and TASKI
are material to the Diversey business, and while important, we do not believe that our overall business is materially
dependent on any individual trade name, trademark or patent.

**Properties**

Our corporate headquarters are located at: Wilmington, Delaware in a leased office of approximately
87,640 square feet. We have more than 120 locations worldwide which is a combination of manufacturing facilities,
R&D centers, laboratories, offices and warehouses. Most of the manufacturing facilities are owned and most of the
R&D centers are co-located with a manufacturing facility. Other properties are leased where we have typically a
long term lease agreement for the material locations.

The following chart identifies the number of owned and leased facilities and properties as well as aggregate
approximate square footage by type, other than the corporate headquarters listed above, used by Solenis as of March

**Legal Proceedings**

In addition to the matters described above (see “—Environmental Matters”), there are various claims,
lawsuits and administrative proceedings that are pending or threatened. Such actions seek remedies or damages,
some of which are for substantial amounts. We have accrued for legal reserves of $3.4 million as of March 31, 2023
and $2.8 million as of September 30, 2022. While we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, we
believe that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions.

In addition to its uncertain tax positions, we have accrued for various contingent liabilities related to
indirect taxes. As of March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we have accrued for potential exposure related to
these positions of less than $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, of which Solenis is indemnified for
less than $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, by the former owners of Solenis’ business
combinations since inception.

In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, we are a defendant in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties and is subject to
inquiries and investigations by various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, we
cannot state with confidence what the timing, eventual outcome, or eventual judgment, damages, fines, penalties or
other impact of these pending matters will be. We believe, based on our current knowledge, that the outcome of the
legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pending should not have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition.

Diversey is subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Based on information
currently available, it is the opinion of Diversey management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened
legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such
matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on Diversey’s results of operations, financial position,
or cash flows.

**About Parent and the General Partner**

Parent is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership that was formed and registered under the
Exempted Limited Partnership Act (as amended) (“ELP Act”) on June 29, 2021.

A key feature of an exempted limited partnership is that it is not a separate legal person distinct from its
partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any rights or property of an exempted limited partnership (whether held in that
partnership’s name or by any one or more of its general partners) shall be held or deemed to be held by the general
partner (in the case of Parent, this will be the General Partner), and if more than one by the general partners jointly,
upon trust as an asset of the exempted limited partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement.
Any debts or obligations incurred by the general partner in the conduct of Parent’s business are the debts and
obligations of Parent. In the event that the assets of Parent are inadequate, the General Partner will be liable for all
such debts and obligations of Parent.

Registration under the ELP Act entails that the exempted limited partnership becomes subject to, and the
limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability (subject to the partnership agreement) and other benefits of,
the ELP Act.

As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be liable for the debts and
obligations of the exempted limited partnership save (i) as provided in the partnership agreement or otherwise
agreed, (ii) if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership’s business and holds himself
out as a general partner to third parties or (iii) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to section 34 of the ELP
Act to return a distribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent and the limited partner has
actual knowledge of such insolvency at the time of such distribution.

The General Partner was incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted limited company on June 29, 2021.
The business of Parent will be conducted by the General Partner.

**DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS**

The following summary of certain provisions of our Existing Notes, Credit Facilities and certain other
indebtedness does not purport to be complete and may not contain all of the information that is important to you, and
is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the corresponding agreements.

**ABL Revolving Credit Facility**

On the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date, we entered into our ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Our ABL
Revolving Credit Facility is available to the Issuer and certain of its affiliates that are designated as co-borrowers
therein and provide for senior secured asset-based, multi-currency revolving loans, swingline loans and letter of
credit availability in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million (“Existing Revolver Amount”), subject
to borrowing base capacity. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (a) $75.0 million and (b) the aggregate
unused amount of commitments under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility then in effect, subject to borrowing base
capacity. Bank of America, N.A. acts as administrative agent and collateral agent for our ABL Revolving Credit
Facility. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility matures five years after the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date. We use
borrowings under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility for working capital and general corporate purposes and
borrowings and issuances of letters of credit.

On the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to enter into an amendment to our ABL Revolving Credit
Facility, which, among other things, will provide for an increase to the Existing Revolver Amount by $200.0 million
(the “ABL Facility Increase”) to an aggregate principal amount of commitments of $700.0 million, subject to
borrowing base capacity. We do not expect to borrow under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition
Closing Date. The loans made pursuant to the ABL Facility Increase will also mature five years after the Solenis
Acquisition Closing Date and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the existing ABL Revolving Credit
Facility.

Borrowings under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility are limited by borrowing base calculations based on
the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and unrestricted cash, minus the
amount of any applicable reserves. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either an adjusted Term
SOFR rate (including a credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin or, at our option, a base rate plus an
applicable margin. We may borrow on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility only up to the lesser of (i) the level of our
then-current borrowing base and (ii) our committed maximum borrowing capacity. Subject to certain conditions, our
ABL Revolving Credit Facility may be expanded by up to the greater of (a) the greater of (i) $250.0 million and (ii)
45% of Consolidated EBITDA (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) of Parent and its restricted
subsidiaries for the most recent twelve-month period and (b) the excess of the borrowing base at such time over the
aggregate commitments under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility at such time. Our ability to draw under our ABL
Revolving Credit Facility or issue letters of credit thereunder is conditioned upon, among other things, our delivery
of prior written notice of a borrowing or letter of credit request, as applicable, our ability to reaffirm the
representations and warranties contained in the ABL Credit Agreement in all material respects and the absence of
any default or event of default thereunder.

Our obligations under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Parent and its direct and
indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain permitted exceptions, including exceptions based on
immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries) as well as certain of
Parent’s direct and indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions where borrowing base
assets are located (subject to certain permitted exceptions; provided that no foreign subsidiary guarantees any
obligations of any U.S. entity). As detailed in the immediately succeeding sentence, our ABL Revolving Credit
Facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of Parent’s, the Issuer’s and each of their direct and indirect whollyowned U.S. subsidiaries’ current and fixed assets (subject to certain exceptions), as well as certain assets of certain
of their direct and indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries; provided that no foreign assets secure any obligations
of any U.S. entity. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral (as
such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and a second-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral (as such
term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) (second in priority to the liens securing our Term Loan Facility and
Existing Secured Notes discussed below), in each case, subject to other permitted liens.

The following fees are applicable under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility: (a) an unused line fee of (i)
0.375% per annum of the unused portion of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any swingline loans)
when the average daily unused portion of such facility is less than 50% of the aggregate commitments under our
ABL Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) 0.250% per annum of the unused portion of our ABL Revolving Credit

210


-----

Facility when the average daily unused portion of such facility (excluding any swingline loans) is equal to or greater
than 50% of the aggregate commitments under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, (b) letter of credit fees of (i) a
participation fee equal to the applicable margin for adjusted Term SOFR rate loans, as applicable, in each case, on
the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) a fronting
fee equal to 0.125% on the average daily amount of undrawn and unreimbursed letters of credit per annum and (c)
certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders, letter of credit issuers and agents thereunder. Subject to
customary provisions for discretionary and protective over-advances, we are required to make prepayments under
our ABL Revolving Credit Facility at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of the outstanding
loans and letters of credit under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility exceeds the then applicable borrowing base.

Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions
on our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur
indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay
dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter
into transactions with affiliates or certain burdensome agreements, modify our governing documents or certain
junior debt documents or change our line of business. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility requires the maintenance
of a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement) of 1.00 to 1.00 (tested for
the four fiscal quarter period ending on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financials
have been delivered, and at the end of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter) during any period commencing on
the date when Adjusted Availability (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the greater
of (a) 10% of the Line Cap (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and (b) $25.0 million and ending
on the date on which Adjusted Availability has exceeded the greater of (a) 10% of the Line Cap and (b) $25.0
million for at least 30 consecutive calendar days.

Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility provides that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our
obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated. Such events of default include
payment defaults to the lenders thereunder, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant
defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material
money judgments, pension-plan events reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, certain change of control
events and other customary events of default, subject to certain materiality levels, default triggers, cure and grace
periods and/or baskets.

**Term Loan Facility**

On the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date, we entered into our Term Loan Facility with Goldman Sachs
Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other arrangers and lenders, which was fully
drawn to fund, in part, the Solenis Acquisition. Thereafter, we also entered into an incremental amendment to the
Term Loan Credit Agreement on April 6, 2022. As of the date of this offering memorandum approximately $1,938.0
million, subject to exchange rates, of term loans were outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, consisting of a
$1,110.0 million Dollar tranche (the “Initial Dollar Term Loans”), a $300.0 million Dollar incremental tranche (the
“2022 Incremental Term Loans”) and a €500.0 million Euro tranche.

On the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to enter into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit
Agreement which, among other things, will provide for an incremental Dollar term loan tranche in an aggregate
principal amount of approximately $750.0 million (“Incremental Term Loan”), which may be increased at our
election up to an amount sufficient to fund certain original issue discount or upfront fees in respect. We expect to
borrow the Incremental Term Loan in full in a single drawing on the Acquisition Closing Date, the proceeds of
which will be used, together with other available proceeds, to, among other things, finance the Acquisition.

Consistent with the existing Term Loan Facility, the Incremental Term Loan Facility will mature seven
years after the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and, although it is not fungible with the Initial Dollar Term Loans
or the 2022 Incremental Term Loans for federal income tax purposes, will be subject to substantially the same terms
and conditions as the existing Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions including that (x) subject to certain
exclusions, a 1.00% premium will be payable on any prepayment in connection with certain repricing transactions
prior to the date that is six months after the Acquisition Closing Date and (y) subject to certain exclusions, the
effective yield with respect to any syndicated, Dollar-denominated, incremental term loans incurred under the Term
Loan Credit Agreement on or prior to the date that is six months after the Acquisition Closing Date, may not be
more than 0.75% higher than the corresponding effective yield for the Incremental Term Loans unless the interest
rate margins with respect to the Incremental Term Loan are increased by an amount equal to the difference between

211


-----

the effective yield with respect to such additional incremental term loans and the corresponding effective yield on
the Incremental Term Loans minus 0.75%.

Subject to certain conditions, our Term Loan Facility, without the consent of the then-existing lenders (but
subject to the receipt of commitments), may be increased (or new incremental term loan facilities added) in an
aggregate principal amount for all such increases, incremental facilities and certain incremental equivalent debt of
no greater than (a) the greater of (x) $600.0 million and (y) 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (as such term is
defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement), minus (b) any amounts previously used pursuant to the basket in
clause (a), plus (c) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments, repurchases and redemptions of, among other
things, pari passu term loans borrowed under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and certain other indebtedness, plus
(d) an unlimited amount, so long as on a pro forma basis, either (1) the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio
(as such term is defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) either (x) would not exceed 5:10:1:00 or (y) at the
election of the Issuer if incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or other permitted investment, would not
increase or (2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not
less than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio prior to such increase.

Our loans incurred under each Dollar-denominated tranche under the Term Loan Credit Agreement
(including the Incremental Term Loans) amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.00% per
annum of the original principal amount of such tranche. The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the
Dollar-denominated tranches of our Term Loan Facility is, at our option, either (1) the base rate (which is the
highest of (x) the then-current federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50%, (y) the
prime rate on such day and (z) (i) with respect to the Initial Dollar Term Loans, the one-month LIBOR for a period
commencing on such date plus 1.00% and (ii) with respect to the 2022 Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental
Term Loans, the one-month Term SOFR for a period commencing on such date plus 1.00%) plus an applicable
margin or (2) in the case of the Initial Dollar Term Loans, one-, three- or six-month LIBOR or, if agreed to by all
lenders of LIBOR loans, 12-month LIBOR or any shorter period (selected at our option) plus an applicable margin,
or in the case of the 2022 Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans, one-, three- or six-month Term
SOFR or, if agreed to by all lenders of Term SOFR loans, 12-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. The
Initial Dollar Term Loans are subject to a LIBOR floor and the 2022 Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental
Term Loans are subject to a Term SOFR floor.

We expect to replace the LIBOR reference rate with respect to our Initial Dollar Term Loans with Term
SOFR (which may be subject to a spread adjustment) in accordance with the terms of our Term Loan Credit
Agreement on or prior to June 30, 2023.

Our loans incurred under the Euro tranche of our Term Loan Facility do not have scheduled amortization
payments prior to maturity. The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the Euro tranche of our Term
Loan Facility is either one-, three- or six-month EURIBOR or, if agreed to by all relevant lenders, 12-month
EURIBOR or any shorter period (selected at our option) plus an applicable margin. The Euro tranche under our
Term Loan Facility is subject to a EURIBOR floor.

We may voluntarily prepay loans under our Term Loan Facility, in whole or in part, subject to minimum
amounts, with prior notice but without premium or penalty (other than with respect to certain prepayments of the
Incremental Term Loans, as further detailed above).

We are required to prepay our Term Loan Facility with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and
casualty events relating to our assets (other than Current Asset Collateral), the incurrence or issuance of specified
refinancing indebtedness or any indebtedness not permitted under the Term Loan Facility and 50% of excess cash
flow, in each case, subject to certain reinvestment rights, thresholds, step-downs and other exceptions.

Our obligations under our Term Loan Facility are guaranteed by Parent and its direct and indirect whollyowned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain customary exceptions, including exceptions based on immateriality
thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries). Our Term Loan Facility is secured by a
lien on substantially all of Issuer’s and each of the Term Loan Facility guarantors’ current and fixed assets (subject
to certain exceptions), and our Term Loan Facility has a first-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral and certain
material real property and a second-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral (second in priority to the liens
securing our ABL Revolving Credit Facility discussed above), in each case, subject to other permitted liens.

Our Term Loan Facility contains customary negative covenants generally consistent with those applicable
to the Notes, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to merge

212


-----

and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make
acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay dividends or other restricted payments, make investments, sell or
otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter into transactions
with affiliates or certain burdensome agreements, modify our governing documents or certain junior debt documents
or change our line of business.

Our Term Loan Facility provides that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations
thereunder may be accelerated. Such events of default include payment defaults to the lenders thereunder, material
inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness,
voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, unpaid material money judgments, pension-plan events
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, change of control and other customary events of default subject
to certain materiality levels, default triggers, cure and grace periods and or baskets.

**DESCRIPTION OF NOTES**

In this description, references to (i) the term “Issuer” refers to (a) if we close this offering concurrently with
or after the Acquisition (as defined below), Olympus Water US Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
“Ultimate Issuer”), and (b) if the completion of the Acquisition is delayed until after the Issue Date (as defined
below), Diamond Escrow Issuer, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Ultimate Issuer (the “Escrow Issuer”), which such Escrow Issuer will, substantially concurrently with the
consummation of the Acquisition, merge with and into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer continuing as
the surviving entity and assuming the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (as defined
below), (ii) the term “Parent” refers to Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited
partnership, acting through Olympus Water Holdings Limited, its general partner, the parent of the Issuer and (iii)
the terms “we,” “us” and “our” each refer to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries immediately following the
Acquisition. Certain defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions”
have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

The Issuer will issue $      billion aggregate principal amount of      % Senior Secured Notes due 2028
(the “Dollar Notes”) and €      aggregate principal amount of     % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro
_Notes” and, together with the Dollar Notes, the “Notes”). The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture, to be_
dated as of the Issue Date (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the
Guarantors (as defined below) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”)
and collateral agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes will each be issued as a
separate Series of Notes, but, except as otherwise provided below, will be treated as a single class for all purposes
under the Indenture. The Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to registration under the
Securities Act, and the Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to any of the provisions of the TIA. The
Issuer does not intend to list the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro
Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) following the Issue Date. There is
no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to
trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of
the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to
trading.

This offering is expected to be consummated on     , 2023 (the “Issue Date”), which is expected to be
prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If the Issue Date occurs prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, unless the offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the
Acquisition, pending consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited), on
the Issue Date, (i) an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds from the sale of the Dollar Notes into a segregated
escrow account (the “Dollar Escrow Account”) and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds from the sale
of the Euro Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Euro Escrow Account” and, together with the Dollar
Escrow Account, the “Escrow Accounts”), in each case, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the “Escrow
_Agreement”), dated as of the Issue Date, among the Escrow Issuer, the Trustee, and The Bank of New York Mellon,_
as Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agent”). In the event the Escrow Issuer issues the Notes into escrow, the Ultimate
Issuer or one of its affiliates will issue an irrevocable equity commitment letter to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit
of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Notes, that will require the Ultimate Issuer or such affiliate,
(i) in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction of the
Escrow Release Conditions (as defined below), to transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the
Dollar Notes, or euro, in the case of Euro Notes, to the Escrow Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and
unpaid interest owing to the holders of such Notes and (ii) in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption (as
defined below), to transfer to the Escrow Issuer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the Dollar Notes, or
euro, in the case of Euro Notes, necessary to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, plus
certain fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent.

If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, upon initial issuance of the Notes,
the Notes will be obligations solely of the Escrow Issuer. Assuming the Escrow Release Conditions have been
satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will become parties to the
Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture to the Indenture and the obligations under the Indenture will become
obligations of the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors.

The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Funds (as defined below),
is more fully described below under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event the
Acquisition Closing Date has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (as defined below) or upon the occurrence

218


-----

of certain other events, each Series of Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue price of
such Series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest (and accretion, if any) from the Issue Date to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). See “—Escrow of
Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The net proceeds of this offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer, together
with any borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the ABL Credit Agreement and the New Equity
Contribution and the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment, to fund the cash consideration of the Acquisition
and related fees and expenses or to repay any debt it incurs in connection therewith and the remainder of the net
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes in each case, as described in this offering memorandum under
“Use of Proceeds.”

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the Security
Documents (as defined below), the Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and the Escrow Agreement. It does
not restate the Indenture, the Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or the Escrow Agreement
in their entirety and is subject to, and qualified by reference to, all of the provisions of the Indenture, the Notes, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Escrow Agreement. Copies of the Indenture (and any
supplemental indentures), the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Escrow Agreement, if
applicable, may be obtained from the Issuer upon request after the Issue Date as set forth below under “—Additional
Information.”

**Brief Description of the Notes**

**_The Notes_**

If the Acquisition is not consummated on the Issue Date, prior to the Escrow Release (as defined below),
the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Escrow Issuer, as secured by the Escrowed Funds on a first
priority basis. From and after the Escrow Release (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes concurrently with
this offering), the Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will:

    - be secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of the Issuer under any
other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral from time to time owned by
the Issuer, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens, as described under “—Security—
Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—
Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”;

    - be secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of the Issuer under
any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Current Asset Collateral from time to time
owned by the Issuer, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens (including Liens on the
Current Asset Collateral securing any Priority Lien Obligations), as described under “—
Security— Collateral,” “— Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants—
Liens” and “—Certain Definitions— Permitted Liens”;

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with
all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including Indebtedness under the Credit
Agreements, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Existing Unsecured Indenture);

    - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer,
if any;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and
Indebtedness secured by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Notes to the extent of the value of
the Collateral (including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the Obligations under the ABL
Credit Agreement);

    - be effectively equal to any existing and future Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Obligations
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Indentures;

219


-----

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Priority Lien Obligations of the Issuer
(including Indebtedness under the ABL Credit Agreement to the extent of the value of the Current
Asset Collateral securing such obligations);

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of all Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries;
and

    - be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent and each Wholly Owned Subsidiary that
guarantees any obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.

As described in this offering memorandum under “Capitalization,” as of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the offering but before giving pro forma effect to the Acquisition, total indebtedness of
$7,305 million (excluding letters of credit, performance guarantees and local lines of credit), including the Notes,
the Existing Notes and borrowings under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the ABL Credit Agreement, and we
would have had unused commitments under our ABL Credit Agreement available to us of $640.0 million. In
addition, under the Credit Agreements we have the option to raise incremental Indebtedness (including incremental
term loans and incremental revolving commitments, as applicable), subject to certain terms and conditions. See
“Description of Certain Indebtedness.”

Certain of the operations of Parent will be conducted through its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer). As a
result, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from Parent’s Subsidiaries to generate the
funds necessary to meet its outstanding Indebtedness service and other obligations, and such dividends and other
payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing the Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Parent’s Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable the Issuer to make some or all of
the principal and interest payments on its Indebtedness, including the Notes.

The Indenture will not be qualified under the TIA, and the TIA shall not apply to or in any way govern the
terms of the Indenture. As a result, no provisions of the TIA will be incorporated into the Indenture unless expressly
incorporated pursuant to this “Description of Notes.”

The registered holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

The Issuer will issue $      billion aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes and €      billion
aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes in this offering. The Dollar Notes and the Euro Notes will constitute
separate Series of Notes under the Indenture but, except as otherwise provided herein, will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of voting and taking all other actions permitted by
holders of the Notes. For purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have consented to or
voted in favor of any amendment, supplement or waiver, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the
Euro Notes shall be calculated by the Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or
such other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such amendment, supplement or waiver. The Notes
will mature on November 15, 2028.

Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,” and “—Certain Covenants—
Liens,” the Issuer may issue additional Dollar Notes (“Additional Dollar Notes”) and additional Euro Notes
(“Additional Euro Notes” and, together with Additional Dollar Notes, “Additional Notes”) from time to time after
this offering under the Indenture.

Except as otherwise specified, the Dollar Notes offered hereby and any Additional Dollar Notes
subsequently issued under the Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture,
including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Except as otherwise specified, the Euro Notes
offered hereby and any Additional Euro Notes subsequently issued under the Indenture shall be treated as a single

220


-----

class for all purposes under the Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Holders of Additional Notes issued will share equally and ratably in the Collateral with the holders of the Notes
issued prior thereto. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “Notes” for all purposes of the Indenture
and this “Description of Notes” include any Additional Notes that are issued. However, in order for any Additional
Dollar Notes to have the same CUSIP number as the Dollar Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such Additional
Dollar Notes must be fungible with the initial Dollar Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in order for
any Additional Euro Notes to have the same CUSIP number as the Euro Notes initially issued on the Issue Date,
such Additional Euro Notes must be fungible with the initial Euro Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Interest on the Dollar Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Euro Notes will
accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Notes will accrue from the Issue Date or from the most
recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each
year (each such date, an “interest payment date”), commencing on October 1, 2023, to holders of record as of the
close of business on March 15 or September 15 (whether or not a business day) immediately preceding each interest
payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The Dollar
Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, and
the Euro Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

All payments on the Dollar Notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent maintained for
such purpose (the “Dollar Paying Agent”) ”) and (ii) the Euro Notes will be made at the office or agency of the
paying agent maintained for such purpose (the “Euro Paying Agent” and, together with the Dollar Paying Agent, the
“Paying Agents”), in each case, unless the Issuer elects to make interest payments due on an interest payment date
by check mailed to the persons entitled thereto at their address set forth in the register of holders; provided that if a
holder of Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the paying agent at least fifteen (15) business days prior to an
interest payment date, the Issuer will pay all interest on that holder’s Notes due on an interest payment date in
accordance with those instructions. All payments on global notes will be made in accordance with the applicable
procedures of (i) The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), in the case of the Dollar Notes, and (ii) Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, in the case of the Euro Notes. Payments on the Notes will be made free and clear of any deduction or
withholding for taxes, except as otherwise required by law.

**_Paying Agents and Registrars for the Notes_**

The initial Dollar Paying Agent and registrar for the Dollar Notes will be The Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Company, N.A. The initial Euro Paying Agent and registrar for the Euro Notes will be The Bank of New York
Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer may change the paying agent or registrar without prior notice to the holders of
the Notes, and the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or registrar.

If any Notes are listed on an exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will satisfy any
requirement of such exchange as to paying agents, registrars and transfer agents and will comply with any notice
requirements under such exchange in connection with any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.

**_Transfer and Exchange_**

A holder may transfer or exchange Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The registrar
and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer
documents in connection with a transfer of Notes. Holders of the Notes will be required to pay all taxes due on
transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Note selected for redemption, except the
unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in part. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange
any Note for a period of fifteen (15) days before a selection of Notes to be redeemed.

**_Note Guarantees_**

If the Acquisition Closing Date occurs after the Issue Date, the Notes will not be guaranteed initially. On
the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), Parent and each of
Parent’s Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a
borrower and/or guarantor under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully and
unconditionally guarantee on a senior secured basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether at

221


-----

Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes
(including interest, fees and expenses which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to the Issuer,
would have accrued on any Obligation, whether or not a claim is allowed against the Issuer for such interest, fees
and expenses in the related bankruptcy proceeding) to the holders, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee,
whether for payment of principal or interest on the Notes, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such
obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein called the “Secured Guaranteed Obligations”).

Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor and will:

    - be secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of such Guarantor
under any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral from time to
time owned by such Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens, as described
under “—Security— Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain
Covenants— Liens” and “— Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”;

    - be secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of such Guarantor
under any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Current Asset Collateral from time to
time owned by such Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens (including Liens
on the Current Asset Collateral securing any Priority Lien Obligations), as described under “—
Security—Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants—
Liens” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”;

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with
all existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including Indebtedness under the
Existing Notes and the Credit Agreements);

    - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness
of such Guarantor, if any;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and
Indebtedness secured by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Notes to the extent of the value of
the Collateral (including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the Obligations under the ABL
Credit Agreement);

    - be effectively equal to any existing and future Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Obligations
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Indentures;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Priority Lien Obligations of such Guarantor
(including such Guarantor’s guarantee of Indebtedness under the ABL Credit Agreement), to the
extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral securing such Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of such Guarantor’s NonGuarantor Subsidiaries.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can
be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Indenture or the Note Guarantee, as it relates to
such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar
laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our

Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to void the Notes
and/or the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Notes) and, if that occurs, you may
not receive any payments on the Notes.” After the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition
closes on the Issue Date), the Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is an Excluded
Subsidiary or is already a Guarantor) that is a guarantor or a borrower under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to

222


-----

execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture (or to execute the Indenture to the extent the Acquisition
closes on the Issue Date), pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee performance and payment of
the Notes on the same senior secured basis. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees.”

Each Note Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Secured Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders
and their successors, transferees and assigns.

A Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon:

(a) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, Division or dissolution) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor to a
Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries, if after such transaction the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted
Subsidiary, or

(b) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, exchange, disposition
or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, Division or dissolution)
is made in compliance with the Indenture;

(c) the Issuer designating such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance
with the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” and the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(d) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue
Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees,” the release or discharge of
the Guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary or the repayment of the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted
in the obligation to guarantee the Notes, except by reason of payment under or the termination or
repayment of such Indebtedness or if a release or discharge is by or as a result of payment in
connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other Guarantee or direct obligation;

(e) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described
under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” or if the Issuer’s Obligations under the
Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or
through redemption or repurchase of all of the Notes or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture;

(f) the release or discharge of the Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Subsidiary Guarantor of
the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment under or the
termination or repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or if such release or discharge is by
or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such Guarantee or
direct obligation;

(g) such Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary;

(h) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent, including as a
result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing Indebtedness or any exercise
of remedies in respect thereof in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreements, as applicable;
_provided that such Subsidiary Guarantor shall only be released if such Subsidiary became a non-_
Wholly Owned Subsidiary pursuant to a transaction where such Subsidiary becomes a bona fide
joint venture where the other Person taking an equity interest in such Subsidiary is not an Affiliate
of Parent (other than as a result of such joint venture);

Grade”; or

(j) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

The Note Guarantee of Parent will be released if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant
defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” if the Issuer’s Obligations
under the Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described
below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or through redemption or repurchase of all the Notes or otherwise) in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture or if there is a release or discharge of such Note Guarantee by, or direct
obligation of, Parent of the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment under
or the termination or repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or a discharge or release by or as a result of
payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation.

Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the Notes. The
Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount
of additional Indebtedness that Parent and certain of its Subsidiaries may incur, such limitations are subject to a
number of significant exceptions. See “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of
Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” below.

As of the Acquisition Closing Date (or as of the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), all
of Parent’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under the circumstances described
under “—Certain Covenants,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of Parent’s Subsidiaries as
“Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” The Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the
Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes.

On the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), each of
Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a borrower and/or guarantor under the Term Loan
Credit Agreement will be a Guarantor. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to the offering, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our Net sales and
approximately 63% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the
offering, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 60% of our total assets (excluding intercompany
receivables and investments in subsidiaries) and approximately 43% of our total liabilities (excluding intercompany
payables).

**_Security_**

_Collateral_

_General_

If the Acquisition Closing Date occurs after the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Escrow
Account initially. On the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date),
the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens on the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with all
Parity Lien Obligations. These Liens will be senior in priority to the Liens securing all Priority Lien Obligations in
respect of Fixed Asset Collateral and junior in priority to the Liens securing all Priority Lien Obligations in respect
of Current Asset Collateral.

The Liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and Note Guarantees will be granted under the
Security Documents in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the holders of the Notes and the
Trustee. The Liens on the Collateral that secure the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term
_Loan Obligations”) have been granted to the collateral agent under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term_
_Loan Collateral Agent”) pursuant to separate security documentation. The Liens on the Collateral that secure the_
Obligations under the Existing Secured Notes have also been granted to the Existing Secured Notes Collateral
Agents under the Existing Secured Indentures pursuant to separate security documentation. The relative rights
among the creditors of the Term Loan Obligations and the holders of the other Parity Lien Obligations (including
the holders of the Notes and the Existing Secured Notes) will be governed by the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement

224


-----

as set forth below under the caption “—Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” The
Liens on the Collateral that secure the Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement (the “Priority Lien
_Obligations”) have been granted to the collateral agent under the ABL Credit Agreement (the “ABL Collateral_
_Agent”) pursuant to separate security documentation. The relative rights among the creditors of the Priority Lien_
Obligations, on the one hand, and the holders of the Parity Lien Obligations (including the holders of the Notes and
the Existing Secured Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement), on the other hand, will be
governed by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement as described below under the caption “—Intercreditor
Arrangements—ABL Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets and property of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
whether real, personal or mixed, other than the Excluded Assets and other than any assets released from the
Collateral.

The Collateral will exclude the following assets and property (“Excluded Assets”), including, without
limitation:

(1) (i) any fee-owned real property that (A) is located outside the United States, (B) has a fair market
value equal to or less than $25.0 million or (C) contains improvements located in an area
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency) as a “special
flood hazard area” and (ii) any real property leasehold interests;

(2) interest in any contracts, permits, licenses, leases, Accounts, General Intangibles (other than any
Equity Interests), Payment Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Letter-of-Credit Rights and Promissory
Notes, if the grant of a security interest or Lien therein is prohibited as a matter of law, rule or
regulation or under the terms of such contracts, permits, licenses, leases, Accounts, General
Intangibles, Payment Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Letter-of-Credit Rights and Promissory Notes, in
each case after giving effect to any applicable Uniform Commercial Code, other applicable law
and principles of equity;

(3) the voting Equity Interests of (i) any first tier Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC in excess of 65% of
the outstanding voting Equity Interests thereof and (ii) any FSHCO in excess of 65% of the
outstanding voting Equity Interests thereof;

(4) assets subject to Capital Lease Obligations, purchase money financing and cash to secure letter of
credit reimbursement obligations to the extent such Capital Lease Obligations, purchase money
financing or letters of credit are permitted under the Indenture and the terms thereof prohibit a
grant of a security interest therein;

(5) assets sold to a person who is not the Issuer or a Guarantor in compliance with the Indenture;

(6) assets owned by a Subsidiary after the release of the guaranty of the Obligations of such
Subsidiary pursuant to the Indenture and each other document evidencing Parity Lien Obligations;

(7) any motor vehicles and any other goods subject to a certificate of title law of any state (to the
extent a security interest therein cannot be perfected by a UCC filing);

(8) any application for registration of a trademark filed with the PTO on an intent-to-use basis until
such time (if any) as a statement of use or amendment to allege use is accepted by the PTO, at
which time such trademark shall automatically become part of the Collateral and subject to the
security interest of the Security Documents;

(9) Equity Interests in any Person (i) other than the Issuer and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries to the
extent a pledge thereof is not permitted by the terms of such Person’s charter documents or joint
venture or shareholders agreements and other organizational documents and (ii) to the extent a
pledge thereof is not permitted by any law, rule or regulation, in each case of clause (i) and (ii)
after giving effect to Article 9 of the UCC and other applicable law;

(10) any Letter-of-Credit Right (to the extent a security interest in such Letter-of-Credit Right cannot
be perfected by a UCC filing) and any Commercial Tort Claim, in each case, with a value (as
determined in good faith by Issuer) of less than $30,000,000;

225


-----

(11) assets to the extent the cost of obtaining a security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in
relation to the benefits to the holders of the notes of the security afforded thereby as determined by
the Issuer in good faith in writing delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent;

(12) “margin stock” (within the meaning of Regulation U);

(13) Excluded Accounts (other than any account included in such definition solely by virtue of being a
zero balance account);

(14) Equity Interests in Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Immaterial Subsidiaries;

(15) certain segregated deposits that constitute Permitted Liens; and

(16) any asset to the extent granting a security interest in such asset would result in a material adverse
tax consequence to any Permitted Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, as reasonably determined in good
faith by the Issuer and notified in writing to the Notes Collateral Agent; provided that this clause
(16) shall not apply to any intercompany Indebtedness for borrowed money issued in connection
with the Solenis Acquisition;

_provided, however, that Excluded Assets will not include (a) any proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any_
Excluded Assets (except to the extent such proceeds, substitutions or replacements would themselves constitute
Excluded Assets) or (b) any asset of the Issuer or the Guarantors that secures Obligations with respect to the ABL
Credit Agreement or the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided, further, that capitalized terms used in clauses (2)
and (10) above and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the UCC as in effect
on the date hereof in the State of New York.

_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will
depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient
to pay any amounts due on the Notes. The Collateral securing our obligations under the Notes and the Note
Guarantees is shared with other creditors. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to
repay the creditors of Priority Lien Obligations and Parity Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Notes. The
fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors, including, among others,
prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the
availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will be dependent
on numerous factors, including the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner
of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no
readily ascertainable market value or market. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be
sufficient to pay the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees (after
taking into account all of our other Indebtedness that is secured on all or any portion of the Collateral on a senior or
pari passu basis). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the
sale of Collateral securing the Notes and the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees (after
application of any proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral to the Priority Lien Obligations) will rank equally in
right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and
other unsubordinated Obligations, including the Existing Unsecured Notes and trade payables. To the extent that
third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the
assets that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent
or the holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue Additional Notes after the Issue
Date as described herein or otherwise incur Parity Lien Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations that would be
secured by the Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and
ratably by the Collateral or secured on a priority basis with respect to the Current Asset Collateral. The ability of the
holders to realize on the Collateral would also be subject to applicable bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a
bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—The value of the Collateral
securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and the other obligations secured
by an equal and ratable lien on the Collateral or a senior lien on the Current Asset Collateral.”

_Release of Collateral_

226


-----

The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the
Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in part, as to any property or assets constituting Collateral, to enable us to consummate the
disposition of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor) to the
extent permitted under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(2) if such property becomes an Excluded Asset;

(3) as to the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee in
accordance with the Indenture;

(4) as described under “—Intercreditor Arrangements”; or

(5) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes also will be released upon (i) payment in full of
the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, on, the Notes and all other
Obligations with respect to the Notes under the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the Security Documents that are
due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any,
are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described below under “—
Satisfaction and Discharge”) or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes under the
Indenture as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

_Creation and Perfection of Certain Security Interests Post-Closing_

Certain mortgages with respect to the Collateral (including any related title insurance and surveys) may not
be in place on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or
certain other security interests (including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts to the extent required
hereunder) may not be created or perfected on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition
closes on the Issue Date). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness— Security interests
over certain of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the Notes are issued. Any issues that we
are not able to resolve in connection with the granting of such security interests may impact the value of the
Collateral. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the issuance of the Notes increases the risk that the
liens granted by those security interests could be avoided in bankruptcy.” To the extent any such security interest
could not be created or perfected or title insurance or surveys could not be obtained by such date, the Issuer and the
Guarantors will agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all acts and
things that would be required to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created and enforceable and
perfected, to the extent required by the Indenture or the Security Documents, and obtain title insurance and surveys
within 90 days of the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date);
_provided that the Issuer and Guarantors will enter into the Security Documents and file UCC financing statements_
on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date). There will be no
independent assurance prior to issuance of the Notes that all assets or properties contemplated to be mortgaged or
pledged as security for the Notes will be mortgaged or pledged, or that we hold the real or personal property
interests we represent we hold or that we may mortgage or pledge such interests, or that there will be no lien
encumbering such real or personal property interests other than those permitted by the Indenture. Delivery of
mortgages or other documents necessary to create or perfect security interests in other Collateral after the Issue Date
increases the risk that the mortgages or other security interests could be avoidable in bankruptcy.

Additionally, the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the Notes will not
require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Notes
Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the holders of the Notes and the Trustee; provided that no control
agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts shall be required (the “Perfection Exceptions”).

Failure to create and perfect a security interest in the Collateral or to obtain title insurance, as required by
the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the Notes, within the required time period
will constitute an Event of Default (as defined below) if and to the extent provided under clauses (3), (9) or (10)
under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” below. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent on
behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes has any duty or responsibility to see to or monitor the performance

227


-----

of Parent and its Subsidiaries with regard to these matters or to determine whether commercially reasonable efforts
have been made by the Issuer.

_Intercreditor Arrangements_

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to two separate intercreditor agreements. On
the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the Notes Collateral
Agent will enter into a joinder agreement to become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to set forth its
relative rights in the Collateral, which provides for the pari passu nature of their Liens, including any Liens that
may, in the future, secure additional Parity Lien Indebtedness. In addition, on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on
the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the Notes Collateral Agent will, enter into a joinder
agreement to become a party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, which governs the relative rights of the Liens on
the Collateral in favor of the ABL Collateral Agent, the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes
Collateral Agents and the Notes Collateral Agent, and provides for the senior priority of the ABL Collateral Agent
in the Current Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured
Notes Collateral Agents, the Notes Collateral Agent and the representative of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness,
and also provides for the senior priority of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral
Agents and the Notes Collateral Agent in the Fixed Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the ABL
Collateral Agent.

If any other Indebtedness is designated as Parity Lien Indebtedness and is permitted by the terms of the
Indenture to be secured by the Collateral, the representatives of the holders of such other Indebtedness will also
become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture
provide that such intercreditor agreements may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders of
the Notes to, among other things, add other parties.

Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent
(and Trustee, if applicable) to enter into and perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreements, binding the
holders of the Notes to the terms thereof by their acceptance of the Notes.

_Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement_

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” has the right to act
or refrain from acting with respect to any Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent is initially the Term Loan
Collateral Agent and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of Parity Lien
Obligations that are Term Loan Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such
earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date,
the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the authorized representative of the Series of Parity Lien Obligations that
constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Parity Lien
Obligations (excluding the Series of Term Loan Obligations) with respect to such Collateral, but solely to the extent
that such Series of Parity Lien Obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the Term Loan Obligations
then outstanding (the “Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”); provided, however, that if there are two
outstanding Series of Parity Lien Obligations which have an equal outstanding principal amount, the Series of Parity
Lien Obligations with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have the larger outstanding principal amount
for purposes of this definition.

With respect to any Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured
Party shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over,
attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any
action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Collateral.

The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent
was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in
the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and (b) the Controlling
Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral
Agent certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and

228


-----

that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Parity Lien Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Parity Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full
(whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that
Series of Parity Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will be
stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the
Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action (including delivery
by the Controlling Collateral Agent of a notice to the ABL Collateral Agent that purports to commence an ABL
Standstill Period (or similar term defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) thereunder) with respect to such
Collateral or any portion thereof, (2) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent is stayed under the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement actions with respect to such Collateral or any portion thereof or
(3) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor
under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent is initially the Term Loan
Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent will have no rights to take any action under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent
or unless expressly permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal
with the Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or
action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral.
Each of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations also agree that it will not contest or support any other person in
contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity,
attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations in all or
any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the Notes Collateral Agent
and each other authorized representative or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations may file a proof of claim or
statement of interest with respect to the Parity Lien Obligations owed to such party; (ii) the Notes Collateral Agent
and each other authorized representative or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations may (but shall not be
obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of
such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material
respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent
with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the Notes Collateral Agent and each other
authorized representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in
opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or
otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such party, including any claims secured by the
Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Parity Lien
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any holder of Parity Lien
Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement but including the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the payments, proceeds
or distribution of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral received by any authorized
representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations and any such distribution or payment in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding to which the Parity Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement
(subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds, or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) shall,
subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, be applied
among the Parity Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the Parity Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after
payment of all amounts owing to each authorized representative (in its capacity as the agent for the applicable Parity
Lien Obligations) and the Trustee; provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of Parity Lien Obligations and
solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and not any other
documents governing Parity Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire
amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the Parity Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a)

229


-----

and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law
in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series of Parity Lien
Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the Parity Lien
Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

It is the intention of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series that the holders of Parity Lien
Obligations of such Series (and not the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of any other Series) bear the risk of any
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series are
unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity
Lien Obligations), (y) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest
in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security
interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity Lien Obligations) on a basis
ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of
any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations or the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Parity Lien
Obligations that is not Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to
any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect
to any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such
Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations (including,
without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations permitted by
the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement ) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the
extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Parity
Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series are
modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy
Code), any reference to such Parity Lien Obligations or the Parity Lien Documents governing such Parity Lien
Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may institute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or
other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations
seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any
Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may seek to have any Collateral or any part
thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Parity Lien
Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to
any Parity Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any
intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Parity Lien Obligations, then it must hold
such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Parity Lien Obligations and promptly transfer
such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement
with respect to Current Asset Collateral, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise
exercises remedies against any Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending
at the time) the Liens in favor of the other authorized representatives for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the
holders of the Notes and each other Series of holders of Parity Lien Obligations upon such Collateral will
automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Collateral realized therefrom will be
applied as described in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder of Parity Lien Obligations acknowledges that the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor. The
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of DIP Financing (as defined below)
to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the
use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law), each holder of Parity Lien Obligations will agree not to object to any such
DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) and/or to any use of
cash collateral that constitutes Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of
the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security Documents and Indenture to the extent the Controlling

230


-----

Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent) with respect to such Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP
Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing

Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each
Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Collateral on the same terms as the
Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any holders of Parity Lien Obligations constituting
DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu
with the Liens on any such Collateral granted to secure the Parity Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured
Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Collateral as set forth in
the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement ), in each case so long as:

(A) the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such
Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds, products, offsprings, profits, or rents,
as applicable, thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority
vis-a-vis all the other holders of Parity Lien Obligations (other than any Liens of the holders of
Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement
of the insolvency or liquidation proceeding;

(B) the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or
replacement collateral pledged to any holder of Parity Lien Obligations as adequate protection or
otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same
priority vis-a-vis the holders of Parity Lien Obligations as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement (other than any Liens of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP
Financing Liens);

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Parity
Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any holders of Parity Lien Obligations are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the
proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement;

_provided that the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_
secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of
such Series or its representative that do not constitute Collateral; and provided, further, that the holders of Parity
Lien Obligations receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations
receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such holders of Parity Lien
Obligations in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.

The holders of Parity Lien Obligations acknowledge that the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series may,
subject to the limitations set forth in the other Parity Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced,
restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to
time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds of the Collateral set forth in the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the holders of Parity
Lien Obligations of any Series.

_ABL Intercreditor Agreement_

_General_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides, among other things, that, notwithstanding the date, time,
method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing the Obligations under the Notes or
the other Parity Lien Obligations (including the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the
Existing Secured Indentures) granted on the Collateral or of any Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations granted
on the Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of any UCC, or any other applicable law or the ABL Credit
Agreement, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures or the Indenture, or any defect or
deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations, the Notes or the other Parity
Lien Obligations, and whether or not such Liens securing, or purporting to secure, any Priority Lien Obligations or
the Notes or any other Parity Lien Obligations are subordinated to any Lien securing any other obligation of the

231


-----

Issuer, or any other Guarantor or any other Person or otherwise subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or lapsed,
or any other circumstance whatsoever, the ABL Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations, and each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Notes
and the other Parity Lien Obligations, each agrees that (i) any Lien of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Current
Asset Collateral, whether now or hereafter held by or on behalf of the ABL Collateral Agent or any holders of
Priority Lien Obligations or any agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession,
statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on the Current
Asset Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Parity Lien Obligations (including the obligations under the
Notes), and (ii) any Lien of the Parity Lien Representatives on the Fixed Asset Collateral, whether now or hereafter
held by or on behalf of the Parity Lien Representatives, any holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations or
any agent or trustee therefor regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law,
subrogation or otherwise, shall be senior in all respects to all Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing or
purporting to secure any Priority Lien Obligations. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Current
Asset Collateral pledged to secure the Priority Lien Obligations will include certain collateral of foreign subsidiaries
of Parent (the “Foreign Collateral”) that will not secure the Parity Lien Obligations and no Parity Lien
Representative will commence or take any enforcement action with respect to the Foreign Collateral and will be
subject to certain other restrictions with respect to the Foreign Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement
provides that the Fixed Asset Collateral pledged to secure the Parity Lien Obligations will include certain real estate
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (the “Real Estate Assets”) that will not secure the Priority Lien Obligations
and no ABL Collateral Agent will commence or take any enforcement action with respect to the Real Estate Assets
and will be subject to certain other restrictions with respect to the Real Estate Assets. The ABL Collateral Agent, on
behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, and each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of
itself and/or the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, each further agrees that during any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will be enforceable as a subordination
agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other
applicable bankruptcy law, and the ABL Collateral Agent, the Parity Lien Representatives, and the agents for any
other Parity Lien Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations will have the rights to seek adequate protection in such
proceedings in accordance with and subject to certain limitations set forth under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, including with respect to the relative priority of their respective security interests in the Current Asset
Collateral and the Fixed Asset Collateral.

Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent” will have the
right to act or refrain from acting on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations with
respect to any Collateral. The Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is initially the Term Loan Collateral Agent
and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date occurs under
the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

_Exercise of Remedies_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that (x) so long as Priority Lien Obligations remain
outstanding, none of the Parity Lien Representative, nor any other holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien
Obligations may (A) exercise any rights or remedies against the Current Asset Collateral or institute any
enforcement action with respect to such rights or remedies; provided, however, that the Controlling Fixed Asset
Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security
Documents and Indenture to the extent the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent)
or any Person authorized by it may exercise any or all such rights or remedies after the passage of a period of at least
180 days has elapsed since the later of: (A) the date on which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent (or the
applicable Parity Lien Representative) declared the existence of an Event of Default and demanded the repayment of
all the principal amount of any Parity Lien Obligations; and (B) the date on which the ABL Collateral Agent
received notice from the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent of such declaration of an Event of Default and
that the Parity Lien Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of the acceleration thereof
or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable documents (the “Fixed Asset Standstill Period”);
_provided, further, however, that notwithstanding anything in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, in no_
event shall any Parity Lien Representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations (A) exercise any rights or
remedies with respect to (x) the Current Asset Collateral if, notwithstanding the expiration of the Fixed Asset
Standstill Period, the ABL Collateral Agent (or any person authorized by it) or the holders of Priority Lien
Obligations shall have commenced and be diligently pursuing the exercise of their rights or remedies with respect to
all or any material portion of such Collateral (prompt notice of such exercise to be given to the Controlling Fixed
Asset Collateral Agent) or shall be stayed under applicable law from exercising such rights and remedies or (y) the

232


-----

Foreign Collateral, (B) contest or object to any proceeding or action brought by the agents for any Priority Lien
Obligations with respect to the Current Asset Collateral or (C) object to the forbearance by the holders of Priority
Lien Obligations from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights
or remedies relating to the Current Asset Collateral or such Priority Lien Obligations and (y) reciprocal restrictions
apply to the ABL Collateral Agent for enforcing rights and remedies against the Fixed Asset Collateral. Subject to
the foregoing, the ABL Collateral Agent and holders of the senior liens on the Current Asset Collateral and the
Fixed Asset Collateral have the exclusive right (subject to the Fixed Asset Standstill Period) to enforce rights,
exercise remedies and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to the
Collateral in which they hold the senior lien without consultation with any agent or holders of the liens with junior
priority in the same Collateral; provided that the Parity Lien Representatives or the holders of the Notes or any other
Parity Lien Obligations may;

(1) file a claim with respect to the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations; provided that an
insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any
Guarantor;

(2) take any action in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its Lien on any of
the Collateral; provided that such action shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement and shall not be adverse to the priority status of the Liens on the Current
Asset Collateral, or the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority Lien
Obligations to exercise remedies in respect thereof;

(3) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion,
claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise
seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the holders of the Notes, including any claims
secured by the Current Asset Collateral, if any, in each case in accordance with the terms of the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement;

(4) file any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements which assert rights or interests available to
unsecured creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor arising under either any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with, or
prohibited by, the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim,
make other filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with
the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to the obligations under the Notes and
the Fixed Asset Collateral; and

(6) exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral (other than the Foreign
Collateral) after the termination of the Fixed Asset Standstill Period to the extent permitted by the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement.

The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will be subject to similar
restrictions with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each holder of the Notes and the other Parity
Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each holder of Priority Lien Obligations,
agrees that it will not (and waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding
(including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien
held by or on behalf of any of the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations or any of the holders of the Notes or the
other Parity Lien Obligations in the Collateral, the allowability of the claims asserted with respect to the Obligations
under the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, or the Priority Lien Obligations in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding, or the provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; provided that nothing in the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any collateral agent or any holder of

Priority Lien Obligations, holder of the Notes, or holder of any other Parity Lien Obligations to enforce the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement, including the provisions thereof relating to the priority of the Liens securing the
respective obligations.

233


-----

So long as neither the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations nor the discharge of obligations under the
Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations has occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has
been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any
collateral agent or any holders of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations or holders of Priority Lien Obligations
in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off) relating to the Collateral or otherwise
received in contravention of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith
paid over to the appropriate collateral agent with a senior lien on such Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes and the Parity Lien Obligations or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, in the same
form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
Each collateral agent will, under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, be authorized by the other collateral agents to
make any such endorsements as agent for the other collateral agents or any holders of the Notes or Parity Lien
Obligations or holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be. This authorization is coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations and the discharge of obligations under the
Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations.

_Collateral Access Rights_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL Collateral Agent will have access to and a rent
free right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral for the purpose of arranging for and effecting the sale or disposition of
Current Asset Collateral, including the production, completion, packaging and other preparation of such Current
Asset Collateral for sale or disposition for a period, after the commencement of an enforcement period, which begins
on the day that the ABL Collateral Agent provides the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent with the notice of
its election to request access to any mortgaged premises pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and ends on
the earliest of (i) the 180th day after the ABL Collateral Agent obtains the ability to use, take physical possession of,
remove or otherwise control the use or access to the Collateral located on such mortgaged premises following a
collateral enforcement action plus such number of days, if any, after the ABL Collateral Agent obtains access to
such Collateral that it is stayed or otherwise prohibited by law or court order from exercising remedies with respect
to Collateral located on such mortgaged premises, (ii) the date on which all or substantially all of the Current Asset
Collateral located on such mortgaged premises is sold, collected or liquidated, (iii) the date on which the discharge
of the Priority Lien Obligations occurs and (iv) the date on which the event of default that was the subject of the
applicable Enforcement Notice relating to such enforcement period has been cured to the satisfaction of the ABL
Collateral Agent or the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, as applicable, or waived in writing in accordance
with the requirements of the ABL Credit Agreement, Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured
Indentures, the Indenture or documents governing other Parity Lien Indebtedness, as applicable.

Each Parity Lien Representative will grant (to the full extent of its rights and interests), without recourse,
representation or warranty, the ABL Collateral Agent and its agents, representatives and designees (a) a royalty free,
rent free non-exclusive license and lease to use all of the Fixed Asset Collateral constituting intellectual property, to
complete the sale of inventory and (b) a royalty free non-exclusive license (which will be binding on any successor
or assignee of the intellectual property) to use any and all intellectual property, in each case, at any time in
connection with its collateral enforcement action; provided, however, the royalty free, rent free non-exclusive
license and lease granted in clause (a) shall immediately expire upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of
all such inventory.

_Set Off and Tracing_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, all funds
deposited in an account subject to a control agreement that constitute Current Asset Collateral and then applied to
the Priority Lien Obligations shall be treated as Current Asset Collateral and, unless the ABL Collateral Agent has
actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the ABL Collateral Agent through the Deposit
Accounts and Securities Accounts that are subject to such control agreements, are proceeds of or otherwise
constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Parity Lien Representatives and the holders of Parity Lien
Obligations; provided that after the issuance of an Enforcement Notice by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral
Agent, all identifiable proceeds of Fixed Asset Collateral shall be deemed Fixed Asset Collateral, whether or not
held in an account subject to a control agreement.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, any
proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited in an account subject to a deposit account control agreement or a
securities account control agreement, shall not (as between the Parity Lien Representatives, the ABL Collateral

234


-----

Agent, and the respective secured parties) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the
relative priorities in the Collateral.

_Release of Liens_

If in connection with the exercise of the ABL Collateral Agent’s remedies in respect of any Collateral as
provided for in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the
holders of Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, then the
Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the other
Parity Lien Obligations, on the Current Asset Collateral sold or disposed of in connection with such exercise, shall
be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or on
behalf of the holders of the Notes and any other Parity Lien Obligations, promptly shall execute and deliver to the
ABL Collateral Agent or such Issuer or Guarantor such termination statements, releases and other documents as the
ABL Collateral Agent or such Issuer or Guarantor may request to effectively confirm such release. The ABL
Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the ABL
Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with an exercise of remedies with respect thereto by the
Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent. In addition, if in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of any Collateral permitted under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Credit
Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture (other than in connection with the exercise of the
ABL Collateral Agent’s rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral as provided for in applicable provisions of
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement), the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, in each case other
than (A) in connection with the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an event of default under the Indenture, then the Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for
itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, on such Collateral shall be
automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal
provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in
connection with such a sale or other disposition in which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent releases its
Liens on such Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Amendments_

The Indenture and the documents governing any other Parity Lien Obligation may be amended,
supplemented, amended and restated, replaced, refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance
with their terms and the obligations under the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations may be refinanced, in
each case, without notice to, or the consent of the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations,
all without affecting the lien priorities or other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however,
that any such refinancing shall comply with the applicable provision of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and shall
not contravene any provision of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a
reciprocal provision with respect to any amendment of any ABL Documents or refinancing of the Priority Lien
Obligations.

_Certain Matters in Connection with Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings_

Until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall be subject
to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the ABL Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use of “Cash
Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) constituting Current Asset Collateral
on which the ABL Collateral Agent or any other creditor has a Lien or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to
obtain financing to be secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, whether from the holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations or any other Person under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law (“DIP Financing”), then each Parity Lien Representatives, on behalf of itself
and the applicable holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that it will raise no objection to
such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing so long as such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing meets the following
requirements: (i) each Parity Lien Representative and the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations
retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the Cash Collateral use or the DIP
Financing that are materially prejudicial to their interests in the Fixed Asset Collateral, and (ii) the terms of the DIP
Financing (A) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing
documentation or Cash Collateral order and (B) do not require that any Lien of the Parity Lien Representatives on
the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or pari passu with any Lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing
such DIP Financing. To the extent the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu

235


-----

with the Liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirements of clause (ii) above, each Parity Lien
Representative will subordinate its Liens in the Current Asset Collateral to (1) the Liens thereon securing such DIP
Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto), (2) all adequate protection Liens thereon granted to the holders of
Priority Lien Obligations, and (3) to any “carve out” therefrom for professional and United States trustee fees that
has been agreed to by the ABL Collateral Agent, and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in
connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the ABL Collateral Agent or to the extent permitted by the
applicable section of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement). The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides for a similar
restriction on the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations to object to a
proposed DIP Financing that would be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral or to the use of any
Fixed Asset Collateral constituting cash collateral that has been approved by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral
Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security Documents and
Indenture to the extent the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent), provided that
similar conditions with respect to the Current Asset Collateral and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations would be
satisfied in connection therewith.

Until the discharge of the Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, each Parity Lien Representative, on
behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that none of them shall
seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding in respect of the Current Asset Collateral, without the prior written consent of the ABL
Collateral Agent, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Foreign Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement
provides for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien
Obligations to seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity
Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations,
acknowledges and agrees in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that the grants of Liens pursuant to the ABL Security
Documents and the Liens on Fixed Asset Collateral constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens, and because of,
among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral (it being understood that in accordance with the other
provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations do
not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations do not
have any secured claim with respect to Real Estate Assets), the Parity Lien Obligations are fundamentally different
from the Priority Lien Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar
dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further
effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the foregoing sentence, if it is held that the claims of the holders of
the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations in respect of the
Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative
Lien priority set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such Collateral, it being understood that in
accordance with the other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations do
not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral), then each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and
on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself
and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledge and agree that, subject to the Lien priority
and application of proceeds provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, all distributions shall be made as if
there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the
Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Current Asset Collateral is
sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien
Obligations), the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts
distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest, fees, expenses and other claims, all amounts owing
in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the ABL
Credit Agreement arising from or related to a default, whether or not a claim therefor is allowed or allowable in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Current Asset Collateral in respect of
the claims held by the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, with each Parity Lien
Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations,
acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of
Priority Lien Obligations, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Current Asset Collateral to the
extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or
recovery of the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders
of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to a reciprocal provision with respect to distributions from the Fixed Asset

236


-----

Collateral and the potential turn over thereof to the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent by the holders of
Priority Lien Obligations.

Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity
Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations,
acknowledge and agree in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that no holder of Priority Lien Obligations nor any
holder of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations (whether in the capacity of a secured creditor or an
unsecured creditor) shall propose, vote for, or otherwise support directly or indirectly any plan of reorganization or
similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, if, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Issuer or a
Guarantor, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor
are distributed or reinstated (in whole or in part) pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan, both on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and on account of the Notes and the other Parity
Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and
on account of the Parity Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same property, the provisions of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply
with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.

Subject to certain designated provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, each Parity Lien
Representative agrees that it will consent, and will not object or oppose, or support any party in opposing, a motion
to dispose of any Current Asset Collateral free and clear of any Liens or other claims under Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law if the requisite holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement have consented to such disposition of the Current Asset
Collateral, such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the
rights of the Parity Lien Representatives under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law (so long as the right of any holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligation
to offset its claim against the purchase price for any Current Asset Collateral exists only after the Priority Lien
Obligations have been paid in full in cash and/or in such other form of consideration as may be agreed to by the
holders of Priority Lien Obligations), and the terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for
the respective Liens to attach to the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral that is the subject of such disposition,
subject to the Lien priorities in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the other terms and conditions thereof. Each
Parity Lien Representative further agrees that it will not oppose, or support any party in opposing, the right of the
ABL Collateral Agent to credit bid under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any
other applicable bankruptcy law with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, subject to the provision of the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The ABL Collateral Agent and the
holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to reciprocal restrictions on their ability to object to, or credit bid
with respect to, any proposed sale of Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Certain Covenants with Respect to the Collateral_

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents, which will contain provisions relating
to identification of the Collateral and the maintenance of perfected Liens thereon. The following is a summary of
some of the covenants and provisions set forth in the Security Documents and the Indenture as they relate to the
Collateral.

_Maintenance of Collateral_

The Security Documents and/or the Indenture, subject to certain exceptions, will provide that the Issuer and
the Guarantors shall maintain the Collateral in good, safe and insurable operating order, condition and repair
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and to do all other acts as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to maintain
and preserve the Collateral. The Security Documents and/or the Indenture also will provide, subject to certain
exceptions, that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall pay all real estate and other taxes (except such as are being
contested in good faith and by appropriate negotiations or proceedings), and use commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain in full force and effect all material permits and certain insurance coverages.

_After-Acquired Property_

Upon the acquisition by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors after the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the
Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) of any assets (other than Excluded Assets), including, but not
limited to, any real property that qualifies as Collateral or any equipment or fixtures which constitute accretions,

237


-----

additions or technological upgrades to the equipment or fixtures or any working capital assets that, in any such case,
form part of the Collateral, the Issuer or such Guarantor shall execute and deliver (i) with regard to real property that
qualifies as Collateral, the items described under “—Real Estate Mortgages and Filings” below within 90 days of the
date of acquisition of the applicable asset (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to
under the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (ii) with regard to any other after-acquired property to the extent
required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents, any information, documentation, financing statements or
other certificates as may be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest, with the
priority required by the Indenture and the Security Documents, subject only to Permitted Liens and the Perfection
Exceptions, in such after-acquired property and to have such after-acquired property added to the Collateral, and
thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to
relate to such after-acquired property to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

_Further Assurances_

To the extent required under the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors
shall execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further
actions that may be required under applicable law, or that the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee may reasonably
request, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests and Liens
created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Collateral. In addition, to the extent required
under the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, from time to time, the Issuer and the Guarantors will
reasonably promptly secure the obligations under the Indenture and Security Documents by pledging or creating, or
causing to be pledged or created, perfected security interests and Liens with respect to the Collateral to the extent
required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents.

_Impairment of Security Interest_

Neither Parent nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will (i) take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take,
any action which would materially adversely affect or impair the Liens in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and
the holders of Notes with respect to the Collateral unless such action or failure to take action is otherwise permitted
by the Indenture or the Security Documents or (ii) grant any Person, or permit any Person to retain (other than the
Notes Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent, the Term Loan Collateral Agent or the Existing Secured Notes
Collateral Agents), any Liens on the Collateral, other than Permitted Liens. The Issuer and each Guarantor will, at
its sole cost and expense, execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments as necessary, or as the Trustee or
the Notes Collateral Agent reasonably requests, to more fully or accurately describe the assets and property intended
to be Collateral or the Obligations intended to be secured by the Security Documents.

_Real Estate Mortgages and Filings_

With respect to any fee interest in any Premises owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor on the Acquisition
Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or acquired by the Issuer or a
Guarantor after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) that
forms a part of the Collateral (but specifically excluding Excluded Assets), within 90 days of the Acquisition
Closing Date (or of the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or the date of acquisition, as
applicable (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the Term Loan Credit
Agreement) (in each case solely to the extent, and substantially in the form, delivered to the Term Loan Collateral
Agent, but no greater scope):

(1) the Issuer or such Guarantor shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent, as mortgagee or
beneficiary, as applicable, for the ratable benefit of itself, the Trustee and the holders, fully
executed counterparts of mortgages, debentures, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt or other
similar security instruments (each, a “Mortgage”) in accordance with the requirements of the
Indenture and/or the Security Documents, duly executed and acknowledged by the Issuer or such
Guarantor, and otherwise in form for recording in the recording office of each applicable political
subdivision where the Premises to be encumbered thereby is situated, together with such
certificates, affidavits, questionnaires or returns as shall be reasonably required in connection with
the recording or filing thereof and evidence of the completion (or satisfactory arrangements for the
completion) of all recordings and filings of such Mortgage (and payment of any taxes or fees in
connection therewith), together with any fixture filings, as may be necessary to create a valid,
perfected Lien, with the priority required by the Indenture and the Security Documents, subject to
Permitted Liens, against the Premises purported to be covered thereby; provided, however, to the

238


-----

extent any such Mortgage is to be filed in a jurisdiction that charges mortgage, intangibles or
similar taxes in connection with the recording thereof, the amount to be secured by such Mortgage
shall not be more than the Issuer’s reasonable estimate of the fair market value of such property;

(2) the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received mortgagee’s title insurance policies (or a binding
pro forma title insurance policy or marked-up unconditional binder of title insurance) in favor of
the Notes Collateral Agent, and its successors and/or assigns, in the form necessary, with respect
to the Premises purported to be covered by the applicable Mortgages, which shall insure that the
Mortgages constitute a valid Lien on the applicable Premises, with the priority required by the
Indenture and the Security Documents, free and clear of all Liens, defects and encumbrances,
other than Permitted Liens. All such title policies shall be in amounts equal to the estimated fair
market value of the Premises covered thereby as reasonably estimated by the Issuer or any
Guarantor, and such policies shall also include, to the extent available, all such endorsements as
shall be reasonably required in transactions of similar size and purpose to the extent available at
commercially reasonable rates and shall be accompanied by evidence of the payment in full by the
Issuer or the applicable Guarantor of all premiums thereon (or that satisfactory arrangements for
such payment have been made) and that all charges for mortgage recording taxes, filing and
recording fees and all related expenses, if any, have been paid;

(3) if requested by the Term Loan Collateral Agent under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Notes
Collateral Agent shall have received, and the title insurance company issuing the policy referred to
in clause (2) above (the “Title Insurance Company”) shall have received an ALTA survey or other
survey of the sites of the Premises in a manner customary for the type of real property subject to
such survey, dated as of a date that is reasonably satisfactory to the Title Insurance Company by
an independent professional licensed land surveyor reasonably satisfactory to the Title Insurance
Company or, in lieu thereof, existing surveys, together with any affidavits or certificates required
by the Title Insurance Company as shall be sufficient to enable the Title Insurance Company to
remove any standard survey exceptions from the applicable title insurance policy and issue
customary survey-dependent endorsements to the applicable title insurance policy; and

(4) the Issuer or the Guarantors shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent customary local counsel
opinions.

_Foreclosure_

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, but subject in all cases to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreements, the Security Documents will provide for (among other available remedies) the sale
of, or other realization upon, the applicable Collateral by the Notes Collateral Agent and the distribution, after
payment of the outstanding fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent (including, but not
limited to, attorney’s fees and expenses), of the net proceeds of any such sale to the holders of the Notes and other
Parity Lien Indebtedness on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior Liens on the Collateral and the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreements. In the event of realization on the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral
may not be sufficient to satisfy in full the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes.

_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_

In addition to the limitations described above, the right of the Notes Collateral Agent to obtain possession,
exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or
at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy or other insolvency laws if the Issuer or any Guarantor were to
have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar law or statute under debtor relief laws in any
applicable jurisdiction) prior to the Notes Collateral Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or
disposed of the Collateral. For example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code,
creditors, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, are prohibited by the automatic stay from taking various actions in
furtherance of debt collection, including obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or
from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, in each case without prior bankruptcy
court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code generally
permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral) owned as of the date of the
bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is
in default under the applicable debt instruments, subject to certain protections afforded to a secured creditor
(including the right to receive “adequate protection”).

239


-----

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition
of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be
made following the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding (or the length of any delay in making
such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value
of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any point thereafter or whether or to what extent holders
of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through adequate
protection or otherwise.

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect
to any Priority Lien Obligations, to the extent senior to the obligations in respect of the Notes or Parity Lien
Indebtedness (including the obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement on the Current Asset Collateral)) is not
sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes would be “undersecured”
and the holders of the Notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral and would
hold unsecured claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of postpetition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent
the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral on account of which payment or accrual of post-petition interest,
costs, expenses and fees are sought (as well as any obligations secured by a senior lien on such Collateral).

In addition, the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee appointed therefor) or creditors of the Issuer or any
Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent, or the incurrence of
obligations in respect of the Notes, as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, preference or otherwise under the
Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law or any other applicable bankruptcy law. If such a challenge were
successful, the Liens may be avoided, leaving the holders of the Notes with unsecured claims (or potentially no
claims at all) against the applicable entities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—
Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or the guarantees
thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Notes) and, if that occurs, you may not receive any
payments on the Notes.”

_Information Regarding Collateral_

The Issuer will furnish to the Notes Collateral Agent, with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, written
notice of any change in such Person’s (1) legal name, (2) jurisdiction of organization or formation, or (3) identity or
corporate structure within 30 days of such change (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have
agreed to under the Term Loan Credit Agreement with respect to Fixed Asset Collateral, or the ABL Collateral
Agent may have agreed to under the ABL Credit Agreement with respect to Current Asset Collateral). Promptly
upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will make all filings under the UCC and
any other applicable laws that are required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents in order for the
Collateral to be made subject to the Lien of the Notes Collateral Agent under the Indenture and/or the Security
Documents in the manner and to the extent required by the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, and shall
take all necessary action so that such Lien is perfected with the same priority as immediately prior to such change to
the extent required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate attaching
supplemental schedules required under the Security Documents to the extent required under and at the same time as
similar supplemental schedules are delivered to the Term Loan Collateral Agent.

_Refinancings of the Credit Agreements and the Existing Secured Notes_

The obligations under the Credit Agreements and the Existing Secured Indentures and the obligations under
the Indenture and the Notes may be refinanced or replaced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the
consent of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral
Agents, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any Notes (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to
permit the refinancing transaction under a Credit Agreement or any security document related thereto, under the
Existing Secured Indentures or any security document related thereto or under the Indenture and the Security
Documents), all without affecting the Lien priorities provided for in the Security Documents; provided, however,
that the lenders providing or holders of any such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (or an authorized agent or
trustee on their behalf) bind themselves in writing to the terms of the applicable Intercreditor Agreements pursuant
to a written agreement (including amendments or supplements to the applicable Intercreditor Agreements) as
required by the Intercreditor Agreements.

240


-----

In addition, if at any time in connection with or after the discharge of Term Loan Obligations or Priority
Lien Obligations the Issuer enters into any (i) replacement of the Term Loan Credit Agreement secured by all or a
portion of the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis or all or a portion of the Current Asset Collateral
on a second-priority Lien basis, respectively, or (ii) any replacement of the ABL Credit Agreement secured by all or
a portion of the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis or all or a portion of the Fixed Asset Collateral
on a second-priority Lien basis, respectively (and in each case, subject to Permitted Liens), then such prior discharge
of Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, shall automatically be deemed not to
have occurred for all purposes of the Intercreditor Agreements, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the ABL Credit
Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures, the Indenture and the Security Documents, and the Obligations under
such replacement Term Loan Credit Agreement or replacement ABL Credit Agreement shall automatically be
treated as Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, for all purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreements, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of the Fixed Asset
Collateral or Current Asset Collateral (or, in each case, such portion thereof) set forth therein. Notwithstanding any
replacement or refinancing of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the ABL Credit Agreement or the entering into of
a new Term Loan Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement (whether or not such replacement or refinancing of
the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the ABL Credit Agreement, as applicable, immediately follows any prior
discharge of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement previously in existence), the Notes and the
Note Guarantees shall be, in addition to being secured by the other Collateral, secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral
or the Current Asset Collateral, as applicable (it being understood that during the period the Term Loan Credit
Agreement is not in existence that the Notes and the Note Guarantees will continue to be secured by a first-priority
Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Fixed Asset Collateral and a second-priority Lien, subject to Permitted
Liens, on all of the Current Asset Collateral, and during the period the ABL Credit Agreement is not in existence
that the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by a first-priority Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of
the Current Asset Collateral and will continue to be secured by a first-priority Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on
all of the Fixed Asset Collateral).

In connection with any refinancing or replacement contemplated by the foregoing paragraphs, the
Intercreditor Agreements may be amended at the request and sole expense of the Issuer, and without the consent of
the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent (if applicable), the Existing Secured Notes Collateral
Agents, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any Notes, (a) to add parties (or any authorized agent or trustee
therefor) providing any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness in compliance with the Credit Agreements, the
Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture and (b) to establish that Liens on any Collateral securing such
refinancing or replacement Indebtedness shall have the same priority (or junior priority) or, if the Credit
Agreements, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture so permit, senior priority, as the Liens on any
Collateral securing the Indebtedness being refinanced or replaced, all on the terms provided for in the Indenture and
the Security Documents immediately prior to such refinancing or replacement.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering is expected to be consummated on     , 2023, which may be prior to the consummation of
the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to consummation of the Acquisition, concurrently with the closing of the
offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Escrow Issuer will enter into an Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and
the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) (i) the gross proceeds
from the sale of the Dollar Notes into the Dollar Escrow Account (together with any earnings thereon and
investments thereof, the “Dollar Escrowed Funds”) and (ii) the gross proceeds of the sale of the Euro Notes into the
Euro Escrow Account (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively, the “Euro
_Escrowed Funds” and, together with the Dollar Escrowed Funds, the “Escrowed Funds”). The Escrow Issuer will_
grant the Trustee (i) for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Dollar Notes, a first-priority
security interest in the Dollar Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations
under the Dollar Notes and (ii) for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Euro Notes, a firstpriority security interest in the Euro Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the
Obligations under the Euro Notes, in each case, pending disbursement as described below.

Upon a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrow Issuer will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid
interest (and accretion, if any) owing to the holders of each Series of Notes to, but not including, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. Prior to the
Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will have very limited assets other than the Escrowed Funds and the escrowed
proceeds of the offering of the Notes and no operations. The Escrowed Funds will be limited to the gross proceeds
from this offering of the Notes. As a result, an affiliate of Platinum will issue an irrevocable equity commitment
letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and

241


-----

the holders of the Notes, that will require such affiliate of Platinum, (x) in the event that any interest is payable on an
interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined below), to
transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the Dollar Notes, or euro, in the case of the Euro Notes, to
the Escrow Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders of such Notes and
(y) upon receipt of a notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption, to transfer an amount of cash to the Escrow Issuer
that will be sufficient, after taking into account the Escrowed Funds at such time, to fund the redemption of the
Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow
Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is
not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be
subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”

The Escrow Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will
release the Escrowed Funds (the “Escrow Release”) to the Escrow Issuer (the date of such Escrow Release being
referred to as the “Acquisition Closing Date”) upon the presentation by the Escrow Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate
addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to March 15, 2024 (the “Outside Date”), certifying that
(a) the Acquisition will be consummated in accordance in all material respects with the Acquisition Agreement
(without waiver or amendment of the Acquisition Agreement that is, in the aggregate when taken as a whole, in the
reasonable opinion of the Escrow Issuer, materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes; provided
that, (1) no reduction in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the
holders of the Notes, (2) no increase in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the
interests of the holders of the Notes if such increase is not funded with additional long-term Indebtedness
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement), and (3) no modification to
the acquisition consideration as a result of any purchase price adjustment or working capital adjustment expressly
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement as of the date hereof shall constitute a reduction or increase in the
acquisition consideration) and (b) the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will (i) become parties to the Indenture by
means of a supplemental indenture effective upon the date of the Escrow Release and (ii) will become parties to the
Purchase Agreement by means of a joinder agreement (the “Escrow Release Conditions”).

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in our good faith judgment, to be incapable of
being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, (any such event being a
“Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Escrow Issuer will redeem each Series of Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) no later than three business days following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or otherwise in_
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable) (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date”) at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price._

As long as Dollar Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the
Escrow Agent at the Escrow Issuer’s written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written
instruction, the Dollar Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested
in cash. As long as Euro Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the Escrow
Agent at the Escrow Issuer’s written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written
instruction, the Euro Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested
in cash.

“Eligible Escrow Investments” means any of the following securities: (1) investment in obligations issued
or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government, the U.K. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.K. government, any constituent nation
of the U.K. or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or any member of the European Union or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the Outside Date, (2) demand deposits, including
interest bearing money market accounts, time deposits, trust funds, trust accounts, overnight bank deposits, interestbearing deposits, and certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of depository institutions in each case maturing
no later than the Outside Date, (3) investments in commercial paper maturing no later than the Outside Date and
having, at the date of acquisition, a credit rating no lower than A-1 from S&P, P-1 from Moody’s, or F-1 from Fitch,
(4) repurchase obligations maturing no later than the Outside Date entered into with a nationally recognized brokerdealer, with respect to which the purchased securities are obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government
or any agency thereof, which repurchase obligations shall be entered into pursuant to written agreements and (5)
investments in money market mutual funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted thereby from

242


-----

S&P or Moody’s, including those for which the Trustee or an affiliate receives and retains a fee for services
provided to the fund, whether as a custodian, transfer agent, investment advisor or otherwise.

If the Escrow Agent (i) has not received an Officer’s Certificate at or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the Outside Date or (ii) has received an escrow termination notice from the Escrow Issuer prior to the
Outside Date, then the Escrow Agent promptly after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Outside Date or the
date on which it has received an escrow termination notice (as applicable) shall liquidate the Escrowed Funds and,
on or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, release (x) an amount of Escrowed Funds to the Trustee
equal to the Special Mandatory Redemption Price and (y) after payment of any amounts due and owing to the
Trustee or the Escrow Agent, any remaining amount of Escrowed Funds to the Escrow Issuer.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the
Escrowed Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes without
the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. For purposes
of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have consented to or voted in favor of any such waiver
or modification, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Notes shall be calculated by the
Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such other services as may be
selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date that is two
business days prior to the date of such waiver or modification. To the extent such provisions relate to the Escrow
Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, no provisions of the Indenture may be
waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes without the written consent of all
holders of the Notes. By its acceptance of a Note, each holder shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the
Trustee to enter into and perform its obligations, if any, under the Escrow Agreement.

**Activities Prior to the Escrow Release**

The Escrow Issuer is a limited purpose entity. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Escrow Issuer’s
primary activities will be restricted to issuing the Notes, issuing capital stock to, and receiving capital contributions
from direct and indirect parent companies of the Escrow Issuer, performing its obligations in respect of the Notes
under the Indenture and the Escrow Agreement, consummating the Escrow Release and redeeming the Notes and
conducting such other activities as are necessary, advisable or appropriate to carry out the activities described above
or related to the Transactions. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Escrow Issuer will not own, hold or
otherwise have any interest in any assets other than the Escrow Accounts, cash and Cash Equivalents and its rights
under the Notes and the Indenture.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Escrow Issuer shall not engage in any activity or enter into any
transaction or agreement (including, without limitation, making any restricted payment, incurring any debt (except
the Notes), incurring any Liens except in favor of the Escrow Agent, Trustee, the holders of the Notes, entering into
any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or engaging in any transaction with its
Affiliates) except in the ordinary course of business or as necessary, advisable or appropriate to effectuate the
Transactions substantially in accordance with the description of the Transactions set forth in this offering
memorandum, together with such amendments, modifications and waivers that are not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially adverse (after giving effect to the consummation of the Acquisition) to the holders of the
Notes.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Escrow
Issuer) will be parties to the Indenture and will not be controlled by the Escrow Issuer; accordingly, prior to the
Acquisition Closing Date, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Escrow Issuer) will be subject to
the restrictions, agreements or covenants in the Indenture or the Escrow Agreement.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to (a) 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any Additional
Dollar Notes) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to      % of the principal amount of the
Dollar Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Dollar Notes redeemed, to (but not
including) the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Dollar Notes on a relevant record date to receive
interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date), in an amount equal to the cash
proceeds of any Equity Offering; provided that: (1) at least the lesser of (a) 50% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Dollar Notes (including any Additional Dollar Notes) then outstanding or (b) $      million aggregate

243


-----

principal amount of the Dollar Notes (including any Additional Dollar Notes) remains outstanding immediately after
the occurrence of each such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture); and (2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity
Offering; and (b) 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes (calculated after giving effect to the
issuance of any Additional Euro Notes) issued under the Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the
principal amount of Euro Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Euro Notes redeemed, to
(but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Euro Notes on a relevant record date to
receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date), with the cash proceeds of
any Equity Offering; provided that: (1) at least the lesser of (a) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro
Notes (including any Additional Euro Notes) then outstanding or (b) €      million aggregate principal amount of
the Euro Notes (including any Additional Euro Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each
such redemption (except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture); and (2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of
either Series of Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Series of Notes
redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of the redemption notice, and accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on the Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of the
applicable Series of Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on
or prior to the redemption date.

At any time, in connection with any offer to purchase either Series of Notes (including pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer (as defined below) or Asset Sale Offer (as defined below)), if holders of at
least 90% in aggregate principal amount of such Series of Notes outstanding tender such Notes in such offer, the
Issuer or such other Person, upon notice given not more than 60 days following such purchase pursuant to such
offer, may redeem all of the remaining Notes of such Series at a price in cash equal to the price offered to each
holder in such prior offer, plus, to the extent not included in the prior offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, on the Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes
on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption
date. In determining whether the holders of at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes in an offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by
funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be
outstanding for the purposes of such offer.

Prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem during each calendar year commencing with the calendar year
in which the Issue Date occurs up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of each Series of Notes, including any
Additional Notes, at its option, from time to time at a redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal
amount of such Series of Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the
redemption date (subject to the right of holders of Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date falling on or prior to the redemption date).

Except pursuant to the preceding paragraphs, the Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s option prior
to June 1, 2025.

On or after June 1, 2025, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of either
Series of Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the applicable Series of
Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Series of Notes redeemed,
to (but not including) the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on June
1 of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest
on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date:

**Year** **Dollar Notes Percentage** **Euro Notes Percentage**

2025 ................................................................ % %

2026 ................................................................ % %

2027 and thereafter ......................................... 100.000% 100.000%

244


-----

Any redemption of Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be performed by another Person and be subject to
one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if any redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent, the related notice of redemption shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be
delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion),
or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be modified or rescinded in the event that any or all such
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption date, or by
the redemption date so delayed (which may exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice in such case).
Such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been met by providing notice to
the noteholders.

Notes called for redemption become due on the applicable redemption date (to the extent such redemption
date occurs and as such date may be extended or delayed). Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the
redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on the
applicable redemption date (whether or not a business day).

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Notes. Any such purchases may
be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to one or more
tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such consideration as the
Issuer or any such Affiliates may determine. The amount of such purchases may be material. To the extent Notes are
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer, such Notes may be cancelled and all obligations thereunder
terminated.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth under the heading “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer
will not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select by lot. If the Notes are
represented by global notes, interests in such global notes will be selected for redemption in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable; provided that (i) no Dollar Notes in
denominations of $200,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part and (ii) no Euro Notes in denominations of
€100,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part.

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or with respect to global notes, to the extent
permitted or required by the procedures or regulations of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, sent electronically) at
least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Notes to be redeemed at its
registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent more than 60 days prior to a redemption
date if (a) the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the
Indenture or (b) in the case of a redemption that is subject to one or more conditions precedent, the date of
redemption is extended as permitted in the Indenture.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note will state the
portion of the principal amount of that Note that is to be redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of the original Note will be issued in the name of the holder of Notes upon cancellation of the
original Note (or transferred by book entry).

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem a Series of Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10
nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of such Series of Notes (which notice will be irrevocable) at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of such Series of Notes on
a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date)
and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any, then due and which will
become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good
faith that, as a result of:

245


-----

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or other administrative
guidance promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations, or other official administrative guidance (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and
(2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of such Series of Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such Series of Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the
payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by another Guarantor who can make such payment without
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts or by the Issuer), and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking
reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new paying
agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly announced and become effective
on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply (a) to a Guarantor only
after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on such Series of Notes and (b) mutatis
_mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a_
Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to such Series of Notes (or, if
the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a later date, after such later
date).

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be distributed in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the distribution of any notice of redemption of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will
deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth
a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that the
obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures available
to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) to the
effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax
Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it
will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the Notes
or with respect to any Notes Guarantee thereof, as applicable, will be made free and clear of and without
withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then
required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any deduction or
withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note or Notes Guarantee thereof is
made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to
tax (including the jurisdiction of the paying agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is at any relevant time incorporated or organized, engaged
in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law or the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’s interpretation or administration thereof to
be made by any applicable withholding agent in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Note or any Notes Guarantee thereof, including (without limitation) payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional
amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each beneficial

246


-----

owner in respect of such payments (i.e., the person treated as the owner of such payments for purposes of the
applicable Tax), after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding or deduction in respect of such
Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by such beneficial owner in respect
of such payments on any such Note or Notes Guarantee thereof in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
provided, however, that (A) if a beneficial owner is not the holder of the Notes, the Additional Amounts payable to
such beneficial owner in respect of any Tax shall not exceed the Additional Amounts that would have been payable
to such beneficial owner in respect of such Tax had the beneficial owner been the holder and (B) no such Additional
Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed, deducted or withheld but for
the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of
power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been resident for tax purposes,
or being or having been a citizen or domiciliary or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or having a place of management in, or
being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Note or the receipt
of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, the Indenture or a Notes
Guarantee thereof;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by
the holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a reasonable written request of the
Payor addressed to the holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before
any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other certification,
information or reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition
to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax; provided that, in each case,
such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible for the Tax exemption or reduction in question;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Note for
payment (where Notes are in definitive form and presentation is required) more than 30 days after
the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made available for
payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding in respect of a payment
with respect to the Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee thereof;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code as
of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations thereunder or official
interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to current Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code (or any amended or successor version described above) and any intergovernmental
agreement, treaty or convention among governmental authorities (or related laws, rules or official
administrative guidance) implementing such Sections of the Code;

(7) (A) in the case of Dollar Notes, any U.S. federal withholding Taxes and (B) in the case of the Euro
Notes, any U.S. federal withholding Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed or withheld by
reason of the holder (y) being a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of Section
957(a) of the Code related within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code to the Issuer or a
Guarantor, or (z) being an actual or constructive owner of 10 percent or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor entitled to vote; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

247


-----

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction
and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Taxing Authority in accordance with applicable
law. In such event, the Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not
available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Trustee (with a copy to the paying agent). Such copies shall be made available to the holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the paying agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Note or any
Notes Guarantee thereof, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Notes
Trustee and the paying agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and
the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the paying agent to pay
Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less
than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable thereafter). The Notes Trustee and the paying agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without
further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this “Description of Notes” there is mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes or any Notes Guarantee thereof,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, additions to tax or penalties with
respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments in respect of any Notes, any Notes
Guarantee thereof, the Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (limited, solely to the
extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of principal or interest on
the Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5)
through (7)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture, any
transfer by a holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to any Payor and to any
jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes or
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to
the Notes (or any Notes Guarantee thereof) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or, in each case, any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein.

**Issuance in euro; payment on the Euro Notes**

Initial holders of the Euro Notes will be required to pay for the Euro Notes in euro, and all payments of
principal of, premium, if any, and interest, will be payable in euro; provided, that if on or after the Issue Date, (i) the
euro is unavailable to the Issuer due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond its control
or (ii) the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have
adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the
international banking community (clauses (i) and (ii), each a “Euro Unavailability Event”), then all payments in
respect of the Euro Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the end of such Euro Unavailability Event. The amount
payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or, in the event the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro
exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal (or, if not published by the Wall Street Journal, other national

248


-----

news source) on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment in respect of
the Euro Notes so made in U.S. dollars during the continuance of a Euro Unavailability Event will not constitute a
Default or Event of Default under the Euro Notes or the Indenture. In no event shall the Trustee or paying agents be
responsible for monitoring any exchange rates or effecting any conversions.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control after the Issue Date, each holder of Notes will have the right to
require the Issuer to repurchase all or any portion (equal to a minimum denomination of $200,000 or an integral
multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Dollar Notes, or equal to a minimum denomination of
€100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes) of that holder’s Notes
pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the Indenture; provided that any unpurchased portion
of a Note must be in a minimum denomination of (i) $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes and (ii) €100,000 in
the case of the Euro Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment (the “Change of Control
_Payment”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid_
interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased to (but not including) the date of purchase (the “Change of Control
_Payment Date”), subject to the rights of holders of Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an_
interest payment date occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Prior to or within 30 days
following any Change of Control, except to the extent the Issuer has delivered notice to the Trustee of its intention to
redeem Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will mail (or with respect to global
notes to the extent permitted or required by the procedures or regulations of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, send electronically) a notice to each holder (a “Change of Control Offer”), with a copy to the Trustee,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date will be no
earlier than ten days and no later than 90 days (unless delivered in advance of the occurrence of such Change of
Control) from the date such notice is mailed or sent, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and
described in such notice. If such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, such notice shall
state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned upon the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall
describe such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s sole discretion, the Change of Control
Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 90 days after the notice is mailed or delivered,
including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not
occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by
the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed. The Issuer will
comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations
thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a
result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and
regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of
Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an
Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being
purchased by the Issuer.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control
Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book
entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if
any. The Issuer will announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the
Change of Control Payment Date.

249


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions
that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a
takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all
Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) in connection with or in
contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) or a third party has made an offer
to purchase at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a
Change of Control Offer (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher
than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of
the Alternate Offer, or (3) notice of redemption has been given to the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture as described
above under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption
price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may
be made in advance of a Change of Control and/or conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a
result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Indebtedness—Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving
rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.”

The occurrence of a Change of Control under the Indenture may also constitute a default under the Credit
Agreements that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. As a result, following a
Change of Control, the Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes unless all indebtedness outstanding under the
Credit Agreements is first repaid and any other Indebtedness that contains similar provisions is repaid, or we obtain
a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness to provide the Issuer with sufficient cash to repurchase the Notes. In
addition, the Existing Notes have similar requirements regarding the Issuer’s obligation to offer to purchase such
Existing Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale
offer.”

The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with
the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes) prior to the
occurrence of such Change of Control.

**_Asset Sales_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) Parent (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time
of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, in the case of any single transaction that involves
assets having a fair market value of more than the greater of (x) $97.5 million and (y) 7.5% of Consolidated
EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in
the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or
in the footnotes thereto for which internal financial statements are available) of Parent or such
Restricted Subsidiary (or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such
liabilities that would have been reflected on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet

250


-----

(or in the footnotes thereto) (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes
or any Note Guarantee)) that are assumed by the transferee with respect to the applicable
disposition and for which Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall have been validly released
by all applicable creditors in writing,

(b) any securities, notes, other obligations or assets received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary
from such transferee that are convertible by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the applicable Asset Sale;

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary in such
Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to
exceed the greater of (x) $390.0 million and (y) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary that is not
Subordinated Indebtedness received from such transferee; and

(e) accounts receivable of a business retained by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, following the sale of such business; provided that such accounts receivable (1) are not past due
more than 90 days and (2) do not have a payment date greater than 120 days from the date of the
invoices creating such accounts receivable;

(3) to the extent that any consideration received by Parent (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be) in such Asset Sale constitutes property or other assets that are of a type or class that constitutes Fixed Asset
Collateral, such property or other assets are added to the Fixed Asset Collateral securing the Notes in the manner
and to the extent required by the Indenture or any of the Security Documents; and

(4) Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary has complied with the applicable provisions of the Indenture
and the Security Documents.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds at its option:

(1) (i) to repay Priority Lien Obligations of Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor (including Obligations
under the ABL Credit Agreement) and, if such Priority Lien Obligations being repaid is revolving
credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto or (ii) if the
assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, to repay any Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is not a Guarantor;

(2) to repay (i) Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Notes, the Term Loan Obligations and the
Existing Secured Notes or (ii) if the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not
Collateral, unsecured Indebtedness and other unsecured obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor
that rank pari passu with the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee (other than Indebtedness
owed to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided that if Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) shall so reduce Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Issuer shall equally
and ratably redeem or repurchase the Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,”
through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may
be below par), or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an
Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to (but not including) the date
of repayment;

(3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, a Permitted Business, if,
(a) after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent or additional Capital Stock of an existing non-Wholly
Owned Restricted Subsidiary and (b) in the case of any such acquisition of assets, to the extent the
assets are of the type that would constitute Collateral, such assets are thereupon added to the
Collateral following their acquisition;

(4) to make a capital expenditure;

251


-----

(5) to make an investment in any one or more businesses or property, plant or equipment or acquire
property, plant or equipment, in each case that are used or useful in a Permitted Business;
provided that (a) to the extent that such investment, property, plant or equipment are of the type
that would constitute Collateral, such investment, property, plant or equipment is thereupon added
to the Collateral following such investment or acquisition and (b) such investment is made in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing.

Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions set forth in clause (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the preceding paragraph if, (i) within 450 days after the Asset
Sale that generated the Net Proceeds, Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) has entered into and not
abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment or payment in compliance with the provisions
described in the immediately preceding paragraph, and that investment or payment is thereafter completed within
180 days after the end of such 450-day period or (ii) in the event such binding agreement described in the preceding
clause (i) is cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) enters into another such binding commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or
termination of the prior binding commitment; provided that if any second binding commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied within 180 days of such second binding
commitment, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a distribution of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset
Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary to Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary of Parent (i) is (x) prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law, rule or regulation, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or
(z) subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States or (ii)
would have a material adverse tax consequence, as reasonably determined by the Issuer, an amount equal to the
portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant;
_provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which such amount would otherwise have been_
required to be applied pursuant to this covenant, distribution of any of such affected Net Proceeds is no longer
prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, rule or regulation, restricted by any applicable organizational
document or agreement, subject to other organizational or administrative impediment from being repatriated to the
United States, and would not result in a material adverse tax consequences, then an amount equal to such amount of
Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would
be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated, whether or not they are repatriated) in
compliance with this covenant. To the extent that the Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale are attributable to a non-Wholly
Owned Subsidiary, the amount of such Net Proceeds required to be applied in compliance with this covenant shall
not exceed the lesser of (x) an amount corresponding to the proportionate ownership interests in such non-Wholly
Owned Subsidiary or (y) an amount corresponding to the amount of distributions permitted to be made from such
non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary to its direct or indirect parent entity that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary for such
purposes at the time such prepayment is required to be made. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a
consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of
Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require Parent or any Foreign
Subsidiary to repatriate cash or to apply any Net Proceeds described in clause (i) above in compliance with this
covenant in the event that such repatriation is not permitted under applicable local law, rule or regulation, applicable
organizational documents or agreements or other impediment within one year following the date on which the
respective payment would otherwise have been required.

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Proceeds, Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net
Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and the Security Documents. Any Net Proceeds that are not
applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt
any such proceeds not required to be applied or invested as a result of the fourth paragraph of this covenant) will
constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of proceeds offered to holders in accordance with clause (2)
of the second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) made at any time
after the Asset Sale shall be deemed to have been applied as required and shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds
without regard to the extent to which such offer is accepted by the holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $325.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, within 30 days thereof,
the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Notes, any other Parity Lien Indebtedness
(if required by the terms thereof) and, if the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral,
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is not a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or

252


-----

a Restricted Subsidiary) and/or unsecured Indebtedness and other unsecured Obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor
that rank pari passu with the Notes (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) that, in each
case, contains provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase, prepay or
redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, to purchase, prepay or redeem on a pro rata basis the maximum
principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and such other Indebtedness
(plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred
in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price
in any Asset Sale Offer, in the case of the Notes, will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to (but not including) the date of purchase, prepayment or
redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest
payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date, and will be payable in cash. The Issuer may satisfy the
foregoing obligations with respect to such Excess Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with
respect to such Excess Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make
an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds.

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer (any such amount, “Retained
_Declined Proceeds”), the Issuer may use those Retained Declined Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited_
by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and other pari passu
Indebtedness, as applicable, tendered in (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale
Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer will select the Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and such
other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts tendered or required to be
prepaid or redeemed and thereafter the Trustee will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (subject to
the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with respect to the global notes) based on the
principal amount tendered (with, in each case, such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Issuer so that
only Notes in minimum denominations of (i) in the case of Dollar Notes, $200,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000
in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of Euro Notes, €100,000, or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in
each case, will be purchased; provided that any unpurchased portion of a Note must be in a minimum denomination
of (i) in the case of Dollar Notes, $200,000 or (ii) in the case of Euro Notes, €100,000. Upon completion of each
Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale
provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Credit Agreements, the Existing Secured
Indentures and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of
certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. The exercise by the
holders of Notes, the holders of Existing Secured Notes and holders of Existing Unsecured Notes of their right to
require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes and Existing Unsecured Notes, respectively,
upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change
of Control or Asset Sale itself does not cause a default, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the
event a Change of Control or Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes,
Existing Secured Notes or Existing Unsecured Notes, we could seek the consent of lenders under the Credit
Agreements or such other Indebtedness to the purchase of Notes, Existing Secured Notes or Existing Unsecured
Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain a consent or
repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes, Existing Secured Notes or
Existing Unsecured Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes, Existing Secured Notes and
Existing Unsecured Notes would constitute an Existing Event of Default under the Indenture, and will constitute an
event of default under the Existing Secured Indentures and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, respectively, which
could, in turn, constitute a default under the Credit Agreements and such other Indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s
ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes, the holders of the Existing Secured Notes and the holders of Existing
Unsecured Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a
change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

Because the Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are secured by the Current Asset Collateral, and
since the definition of “Net Proceeds” excludes all amounts in respect of any Asset Sale that are used to repay any

253


-----

Indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, it is unlikely that any
meaningful amount of Net Proceeds will be generated from any Asset Sale of Current Asset Collateral so long as the
ABL Credit Agreement remains outstanding.

The Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with the
written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes) prior to the date by which the
Issuer is required to make such Asset Sale Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Acquisition Closing Date (or following the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes
on the Issue Date):

(1) a Series of Notes has Investment Grade Ratings from both of the Ratings Agencies; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter and subject to the provisions of the second
succeeding paragraph, (i) the Note Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (to
the extent that guarantees by the Guarantors of all other Priority Lien Obligations and Parity Lien Indebtedness are
substantially concurrently released, and the Liens on the Collateral securing such Priority Lien Obligations and
Parity Lien Indebtedness are also substantially concurrently released) and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under
the following sections in this offering memorandum (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) will be suspended
with respect to such Series of Notes:

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; but only to the extent related to properties
or assets of Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries that do not constitute Collateral;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”; and

(8) clause (4) of the covenant described below under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Board of Directors of the Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may not designate any of Parent’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries” unless the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer
would have been able, under the terms of the Indenture, to designate such Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries
if the Suspended Covenants were not suspended. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated,
the failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (as defined below) (including any
action taken or omitted to be taken with respect thereto and including any actions taken at any time pursuant to any
contractual obligations arising during the Suspension Period) will not give rise to a Default or Event of Default
under the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Series of Notes no longer have an Investment Grade
Rating from both of the Ratings Agencies, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of
such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”). The period of time between the suspension of covenants as
set forth above and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” All Indebtedness incurred
(including Acquired Debt) and Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued during the Suspension Period will be

254


-----

deemed to have been incurred or issued in reliance on the exception provided by clause (2) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt.” Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant will be made as if the
“Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect prior to, but not during, the period that the “Restricted Payments”
covenant was suspended as set forth above. For purposes of determining compliance with the covenant described
above under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the Excess Proceeds from all Asset Sales not
applied in accordance with such covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero after the Reversion Date. In addition,
for purposes of the covenant described under “— Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements
entered into by Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of Parent during the Suspension Period prior
to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (12) of the second paragraph of “—
Transactions with Affiliates,” and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such
Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been
entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant
described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” or any
provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and during the
Suspension Period.

Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Future Guarantees” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on which any
guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be
deemed to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension
Period and Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or
breach of any of the Suspended Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Indenture with
respect to the applicable Series of Notes, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments
or obligations following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; provided that
such contractual commitments or obligations were entered into during the Suspension Period and not in
contemplation of a reversion of the Suspended Covenants; provided, further, that, to the extent any such
commitment or obligation results in the making of a Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made
under clause (c) of the first paragraph or under the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted
Payments” and, if not permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted
under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” and shall be
deducted for purposes of calculating the amount pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not be less than zero).

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Suspension
Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor the ratings of the Notes, independently
determine or verify if such events have occurred or notify the holders of Notes of any Suspension Period or
Reversion Date. The Trustee may provide a copy of such Officer’s Certificate to any holder of Notes upon written
request.

There can be no assurance that either Series of Notes will ever achieve an Investment Grade Rating or that
any such rating will be maintained.

**_Restricted Payments_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of Parent’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries) (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than
Disqualified Stock) of Parent and other than dividends or distributions payable to Parent or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries);

255


-----

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving Parent) any Equity Interests of Parent or
any direct or indirect parent of Parent;

(3) make any voluntary or optional payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Indebtedness of Parent, the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor in an outstanding aggregate principal amount greater than the greater of (x) $130.0
million and (y) 10.0% of Consolidated EBITDA that is contractually subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes or to any Note Guarantee, except any such payment on Indebtedness
permitted under clause (6) or (7) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and a payment of interest
when due or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or the purchase, redemption, repurchase,
defeasance, acquisition or retirement for value of any such Indebtedness within 365 days of the
Stated Maturity thereof; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(a) solely in the case of clause (2) below, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would
occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;

(b) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
Restricted Payment has been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, the
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been less than
or equal to 6.25 to 1.00; and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments
made by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries since November 9, 2021 (including Restricted
Payments permitted by clause (3) of the next succeeding paragraph and excluding Restricted
Payments permitted by all other clauses of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum,
without duplication, of:

(1) the greater of (x) $650.0 million and (y) 50.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA;

(2) an amount (which may not be less than zero) equal to 50% of the
Consolidated Net Income of Parent for the period (taken as one accounting period) from
July 1, 2021 to the end of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal
financial statements of Parent are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if
such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 0% of such deficit); plus

(3) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and Fair Market
Value of property other than cash (as determined in accordance with the second
succeeding paragraph), received by Parent after November 9, 2021 as a contribution to its
common equity capital or from the issue or sale of Qualifying Equity Interests of Parent
or any direct or indirect parent of Parent (excluding, without duplication, Designated
Preferred Stock, the Cash Contribution Amount, Excluded Contributions, the New Equity
Contribution and the New Perpetual Preferred Equity Investment), or from the issue or
sale of Disqualified Stock of Parent or debt securities of Parent, in each case that have
been converted into or exchanged for Qualifying Equity Interests of Parent (other than
Qualifying Equity Interests and convertible or exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt
securities sold to a Subsidiary of Parent); plus

(4) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of
property other than cash (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding
paragraph) received by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from (A) the sale or
disposition (other than to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Restricted
Investments made after November 9, 2021 and from repurchases and redemptions of such
Restricted Investments from Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries by any Person (other

256


-----

than Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and from repayments of loans or advances that
constituted Restricted Investments made after November 9, 2021; (B) the sale (other than
to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) of the Capital Stock of an Unrestricted
Subsidiary; (C) a distribution or dividend from an Unrestricted Subsidiary, to the extent
that such amounts were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net Income of Parent
for such period; (D) any Restricted Investment that was made after November 9, 2021 in
a Person that is not a subsidiary at such time that subsequently becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent; and (E) any returns, profits, distributions and similar amounts
received on account of any Permitted Investment made after November 9, 2021 subject to
a dollar-denominated or ratio-based basket (to the extent in excess of the original amount
of such Investment) and without duplication of any returns, profits, distributions or
similar amounts included in the calculation of such basket; plus

(5) in the event that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Parent designated as
such after November 9, 2021 is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or has been
merged or consolidated with or into or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is liquidated
into, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after November 9, 2021, an
amount (which may not be less than zero) equal to 100% of the Fair Market Value of
Parent’s Restricted Investment in such Subsidiary (as determined in accordance with the
second succeeding paragraph) as of the date of such redesignation, combination or
transfer (or of the assets transferred or conveyed, as applicable), after deducting any
Indebtedness associated with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so designated or combined or
any Indebtedness associated with the assets so transferred or conveyed (other than in each
case to the extent that the designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary
constituted a Permitted Investment); plus

(6) the aggregate amount of Retained Declined Proceeds since November
9, 2021;

_provided, that for purposes of clauses (c)(3) through (c)(6) above for the period from November 9, 2021 to the_

2028 Secured Indenture.

Parent’s Restricted Payment capacity pursuant to the foregoing clause (c) as of March 31, 2023 was
approximately $650.0 million.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any
similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent to the holders of its Equity Interests so
long as Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives at least its pro rata share of such
dividend or distribution;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of
the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of Parent) of, Equity Interests of

utilized for any such Restricted Payment will not be considered to be net proceeds of Qualifying
Equity Interests for purposes of clause (c)(3) of the immediately preceding paragraph;

(3) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 90 days after the date
of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date

(4) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness

reclassify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant or the definition of “Permitted Investment” and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the
definition of “Permitted Investment” as of the date of such reclassification. If Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment that, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, in the good
faith determination of the Issuer, would be permitted under the requirements of the Indenture, such Restricted

260

Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Indenture notwithstanding any subsequent
adjustment made in good faith to Parent’s financial statements affecting Consolidated Net Income.

date of determination or its incurrence or issuance, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under the Term Loan Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be
deemed to have been incurred in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1)(a) of the definition of “Permitted
Debt” and may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion or amortization of original
issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same
terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the
payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of preferred stock or
Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or
Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant or the covenant set forth under “—Liens”; provided, in each such
case, that the amount thereof shall be included in Fixed Charges of Parent as accrued. For purposes of determining
compliance with any U.S. dollar- denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance of
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or the liquidation
preference of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be utilized, calculated
based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of
term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving or delayed draw Indebtedness, or first issued, in the
case of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or, in each case, at the option of the borrower or issuer of such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the date on which the rate of interest and other pricing terms of
such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock are determined or the date of determination; provided, that
if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock issued to Refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a
foreign currency (or in a different currency from such Indebtedness so being incurred or Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock being issued), and such refinancing would cause the applicable clauses of the definition of

267


-----

“Permitted Debt” (or categories of Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by reference to a percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of
such refinancing, such clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” (or categories of Permitted Liens) measured by
a dollar amount or by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness or liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock
or preferred stock does not exceed (i) the outstanding or, in the case of revolving Indebtedness, committed, principal
amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being
Refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of Additional Refinancing Amounts incurred or payable in connection
with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent may incur or issue pursuant
to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency
values.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness, delayed
draw facility or other committed debt financing incurred under such ratio-based basket, Parent may elect (which
election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), at any time, to either (x) give pro forma effect to
the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness, in which case such committed amount may
thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, without further compliance with any
ratio-based component of any provision of the Indenture, or (y) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of the actual
amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw facility or other committed debt financing, in which
case, the ability to incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness will be subject to such ratio-based
basket (to the extent being incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each such incurrence. For purposes of
determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of any
particular Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued pursuant to and in compliance with,
this covenant, if any commitments in respect of revolving or deferred draw Indebtedness are established in reliance
on any clause of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA, at the Issuer’s option, on the date of the initial borrowing of such Indebtedness or entry into the definitive
agreement providing the commitment to fund such Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of
the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness (such committed amount, a “Grower Tested Committed Amount”)
may thereafter be borrowed and reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, irrespective of whether or not
such incurrence would cause such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded and such Grower Tested
Committed Amount shall be deemed outstanding pursuant to such basket so long as such commitments are in effect.
If any Indebtedness is incurred or any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued to Refinance Indebtedness (or
unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness) initially incurred (or established) or Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock issued (or to Refinance Indebtedness incurred (or commitments established) or Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock issued) to Refinance Indebtedness initially incurred (or commitments initially established) or
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock initially issued in reliance on any clause or clauses of the definition of
“Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or a ratio-based basket at the
time of incurrence or issuance, and such refinancing would cause such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be
exceeded or ratio to be unmet if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated
EBITDA or ratio shall not be deemed to be exceeded or unmet (and such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock shall be deemed permitted) so long as the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such
Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the principal amount or
liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being Refinanced, plus Additional
Refinancing Amounts in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, if, on any
date, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions
(A) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock as permitted by a ratio-based or ratio-referent
clause or provision and (B) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under a non-ratiobased or non-ratio-referent clause or provision, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such date with respect
to any incurrence under the applicable ratio-based or ratio referent clause or provision without giving effect to the
incurrence under such non-ratio-based or non-ratio-referent clause or provision made in connection with such
transaction or series of related transactions.

If Indebtedness originally incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock originally issued in reliance
upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Ratio Incremental Amount under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time,

268


-----

then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1)
so long as the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with
such refinancing.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Liens_**

Parent will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind (other than Permitted Liens), securing Indebtedness of
Parent, the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, on any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired or
any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom; provided that, Parent, the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
may create any Lien upon any property or assets that are not at such time Collateral in order to secure any Priority
Lien Obligations or Parity Lien Indebtedness (other than customary liens on cash collateral in connection with the
ABL Credit Agreement and other revolving credit facilities), so long as it concurrently grants a first-priority Lien
upon such property or assets that would constitute Fixed Asset Collateral or a second-priority Lien upon such
property or assets that would constitute Current Asset Collateral, in each case as security for the Notes or the Note
Guarantees, such that the property or assets subject to such Lien will constitute Collateral under the Indenture and
the Security Documents, subject, in each case, to local law limitations and Permitted Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be deemed
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release of the Lien that gave rise to the
obligation to secure the Notes, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any Note Guarantee, the termination and
discharge of such Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or
transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent that is governed
by the provisions of the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”) to any Person not
an Affiliate of Parent of the property or assets secured by such Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such
Lien.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described in the definition of
“Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any
combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets
the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later
divide, classify or reclassify, such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner
that complies with this covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien or such item
of Indebtedness secured by such Lien in one of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and such Lien
securing such item of Indebtedness will be treated as being incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such clauses
or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the incurrence thereof, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors
to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on

good faith, which determination shall be conclusive) and in the case of subclause (ii) either (x) the
Issuer determines (in good faith) that such encumbrance or restriction will not affect the Issuer’s

maintenance covenant relating to such Indebtedness;

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction;

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any preferred stock in
receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common

limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof, the District of Columbia or, in the case of Parent, the Cayman Islands. In addition, Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary may change its name.

All references to “Parent” or “Issuer,” as applicable, in this “Description of Notes” shall be deemed to
include any successor entity that assumes all of the obligations of Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, under the Notes

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease,

$97.5 million and (y) 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any
direct or indirect parent of the Issuer); and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving

of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) to the holders of the Notes in any
material respect than the original agreement as in effect on the Issue Date;

Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, except for guarantees of Indebtedness in respect of
borrowed money, and (y) pledges of Equity Interests of Unrestricted Subsidiaries;

(16) any issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise
pursuant to, or the funding of, employment arrangements, stock option and stock ownership plans
or similar employee benefit plans approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect parent of the Issuer, or of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent, as appropriate, in good faith;

(17) the entry into any tax-sharing arrangements between Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
and any of their direct or indirect parents; provided, however, that any payment made by Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under such tax-sharing arrangements is, at the time made,
otherwise permitted by the covenant described above under “—Restricted Payments”;

(18) transactions with Unrestricted Subsidiaries, customers, clients, lessors, landlords, suppliers,
contractors, or purchasers or sellers of goods or services that are Affiliates, in each case, in the
ordinary course of business and otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Indenture that are
fair to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, or made in the reasonable determination of senior
management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer;

(19) transactions between Parent and any Person that is an Affiliate solely due to the fact that a director
of such Person is also a director of Parent or any direct or indirect parent of Parent; provided,
_however, that such director abstains from voting as a director of Parent or such direct or indirect_
parent, as the case may be, on any matter involving such other Person;

(20) payments by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to or on behalf of the Principals for any
financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment

the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer;

any such fees or expenses); and

(24) transactions undertaken in good faith (as certified by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of Parent in an Officer’s Certificate) for the purpose of improving the consolidated tax efficiency
of Parent and its Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in
the Indenture.

**_Future Guarantees_**

If, after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date),
(a) any Subsidiary of Parent (including any newly formed, newly acquired or newly redesignated Restricted
Subsidiary, but excluding any Securitization Entity and any Excluded Subsidiary) that is not then a Guarantor
guarantees or incurs any Indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement or (b) Parent otherwise elects to have
any Restricted Subsidiary become a Guarantor, then, in each such case, Parent shall cause such Restricted
Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture to the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the Indenture providing for a Note Guarantee by such
Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Indenture and applicable to the other
Guarantors; provided that, in the case of clause (a), such supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered to
the Trustee within 20 business days of the date that such Indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement has
been guaranteed or incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary.

Each Note Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Note Guarantee, as it relates to such Restricted
Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or
the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Notes) and, if that occurs, you may not
receive any payments on the Notes.”

Each Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue Date if the
Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) shall also become a party to the applicable Security Documents and shall as
promptly as practicable execute and deliver such security instruments, financing statements, mortgages, deeds of
trust and other related real estate deliverables (in substantially the same form as those executed and delivered with
respect to the Collateral on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue
Date) or on the date first delivered in the case of Collateral delivered after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the
Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) (to the extent, and substantially in the form, delivered on the
Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or the date first delivered,
as applicable (but no greater scope)) as may be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected firstpriority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute Fixed Asset Collateral
and a perfected second-priority security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute
Current Asset Collateral, in either case, as security for such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee and as may be necessary to
have such property or assets added to the Collateral as required under the Security Documents and the Indenture,
and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such properties
and assets to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

For the avoidance of doubt, Diversey Holdings, Ltd. and its subsidiaries (excluding any Securitization
Entity and any Excluded Subsidiary) shall only be required to provide a Note Guarantee within 20 business days
after any such entity guarantees or incurs any Indebtedness under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.

Each Note Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture described under “—Note Guarantees.”

**_Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

After the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the
Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may designate any Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation would not cause a Default. If such
Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate Fair Market Value of all outstanding
Investments in such Restricted Subsidiary by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be deemed to be an
Investment made as of the time of determination or the designation and will reduce the amount available for
Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under “—Restricted Payments” or under one or more
clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Issuer. That designation will only be
permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if such Restricted Subsidiary otherwise meets the
definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

276


-----

Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct
or indirect parent of the Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under “—
Restricted Payments” or under one of more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” If, at any time, any
Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will
thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Indenture and any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of
Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis
as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary shall be evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied
with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.”

**_Reports_**

The Indenture will provide that so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide the Trustee
and, upon request, to holders of Notes a copy of all of the information and reports referred to below:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year (or such longer period as may be permitted by the
Commission pursuant to the reporting requirements for a non-accelerated filer), annual audited
consolidated financial statements of Parent that would have been required to be contained in an
Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act if Parent had been a reporting company
under the Exchange Act for such fiscal year (but only to the extent similar information is presented
in this offering memorandum), including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to the periods presented and a report on the
annual financial statements by Parent’s independent accountants (all of the foregoing financial
information to be prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the corresponding financial
information included in this offering memorandum);

(2) within 45 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or such
longer period as may be permitted by the Commission pursuant to the reporting requirements for a
non-accelerated filer), unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements of Parent (including a
balance sheet and related statements of profit and loss and statement of cash flows) that would
have been required to be contained in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act if
Parent had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act for the interim period as of, and for
the period ending on, the end of such fiscal quarter (but only to the extent similar information is
presented in this offering memorandum), including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (all of the foregoing financial information to be
prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information included
in this offering memorandum), subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of
footnotes; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified for filing current reports on Form 8-K by the
Commission, current reports containing substantially all of the information that would be required
to be filed in a current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act (as in effect on November 9,
2021) pursuant to Items 1.01, 1.03, 2.01, 2.03, 2.04, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01, 5.02(a) through (c) (other
than compensation information), and 5.03(b) (in each case, excluding the financial statements, pro
forma financial information and exhibits, if any, that would be required by Item 9.01) of Form 8-K
if Parent had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that no such
current report will be required to be furnished if Parent determines in its good faith judgment that
such event is not material to holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or
prospects of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if the Issuer determines in

277


-----

its good faith judgment that such disclosure would otherwise cause material competitive harm to
the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or contains any trade secrets, privileged or confidential information
obtained from another Person or competitively sensitive information;

_provided, however, that in addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuer will be required to make_
available to the holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes, bona fide market makers in the Notes affiliated
with any initial purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the
Notes) such information by (i) posting to its website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or
of a Subsidiary of Parent) or on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system, in each case,
subject to the extensions provided for in clauses (1) and (2) above, within 15 days after the time the Issuer would be
required to provide such information pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3) above, as applicable, or (ii) otherwise
providing substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) (it being
understood that, without limitation, making such reports available on Bloomberg or another comparable private
electronic information service shall constitute substantially comparable availability). The Issuer may condition the
delivery of any such reports to such holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes, bona fide market makers
in the Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of
investment in the Notes) on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained
therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any
purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such
reports (and the information contained therein) and information; and the Issuer may deny access to any
competitively-sensitive information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any holders,
bona fide prospective investors in the Notes, bona fide market makers in the Notes affiliated with any initial
purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Notes) that is a
competitor of Parent and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of
such information and reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to Parent and its Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Issuer will not be required to furnish any information, financial
statements, certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the Commission with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, or (iii) Rule
3-01(e), Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (b) such reports will not be required to
contain any segment reporting, (c) such reports shall not be required to present compensation required by Item 402
of Regulation S-K or otherwise or beneficial ownership information; and (d) the information and reports referred to
in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be required to include any exhibits required
by Item 15 of Form 10-K, Item 6 of Form 10-Q or Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the holders of
the Notes if the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer has (i) filed such reports with the Commission via
the EDGAR (or successor) filing system or if such reports are otherwise publicly available, or (ii) posted such
reports on the Issuer’s (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of Parent) website. The
Trustee will have no responsibility to determine whether such posting has occurred.

For so long as any Subsidiaries of Parent have been designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required to be provided by this covenant will include a reasonably
detailed summary presentation (which need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors), either on the face of the
financial statements, in the footnotes thereto, in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” or other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of Parent.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any Notes
are outstanding, it will furnish to holders of the Notes and to prospective investors, upon their request, the
information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or any successor
provision).

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information and other information and
documents required to be provided as described above may be, rather than those of Parent, those of (a) any
predecessor or successor of Parent or any entity meeting the requirements of clause (b) or (c) of this paragraph, (b)
any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent that, together with its consolidated Subsidiaries, constitutes substantially all

278


-----

of the assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (“Qualified Reporting Subsidiary”) or (c) any direct or
indirect parent of Parent; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such Qualified Reporting
Subsidiary of Parent or such direct or indirect parent of Parent, the same is accompanied by consolidating
information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary of Parent) or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuer or a third party, that
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary
or such parent entity (as the case may be), on the one hand, and the information relating to Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information
referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by Parent’s independent
accountants.

So long as Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(a) within 15 business days after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant, use commercially reasonable
efforts to hold a conference call, at a time selected by the Issuer, to discuss such reports and the
results of operations for the relevant reporting period (it being understood that any such call may
be combined with any similar call held for any of Parent’s or the Issuer’s other lenders or security
holders); and

(b) post to its or the Issuer’s website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or of
a Subsidiary of Parent) or on Intralinks or any comparable password-protected online data system,
which will require a confidentiality acknowledgment, prior to the date of the conference call
required to be held in accordance with clause (a) of this paragraph, announcing the time and date
of such conference call and either including all information necessary to access the call or
informing holders, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with any initial purchaser and
securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the
applicable password or other login information.

Any Person who requests or accesses such financial information required by this covenant will be required
to represent to the Issuer (to the reasonable good faith satisfaction of the Issuer) that:

(1) it is a holder, a Beneficial Owner of the Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the Notes or a
bona fide market maker in the Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser or a bona fide securities
analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such information confidential and will not communicate the information to any Person
and not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of Parent and
its Subsidiaries; and

(4) it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is principally engaged in a
Permitted Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenue from operating a Permitted
Business.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Issuer to comply with any of its obligations
hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will not constitute an Event of
Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder. To the extent any
information is not provided within the time periods specified in this covenant and such information is subsequently
provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default
with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

The delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only
and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of any information
contained therein.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

The Indenture shall provide that, as it relates to any action being taken in connection with a Limited
Condition Transaction, for purposes of (i) determining compliance with any provision of the Indenture that requires

279


-----

the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Total Debt
Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio and Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, or (ii) testing availability
under baskets set forth in the Indenture (including baskets determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or
Total Assets, as applicable), in each case, at the option of Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in
connection with any Limited Condition Transaction to be evidenced by delivery of an Officer’s Certificate to the
Trustee, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder shall be
made (1) in the case of any acquisition (including by way of merger) or similar Investment (including the
assumption or incurrence of Indebtedness in connection therewith), at the time of (or, in the case of any calculation
or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which such calculation is made at the time of) either (x) the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to
such acquisition or Investment, (y) the public announcement of an intention to make an offer in respect of the target
of such acquisition or Investment or (z) the consummation of such acquisition or Investment, (2) in the case of any
Restricted Payment, at the time of (or, in the case of any calculation or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or
as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such calculation is made at the time of) (x) the
irrevocable declaration of such Restricted Payment or (y) the making of such Restricted Payment and (3) in the case
of any voluntary or optional payment or prepayment on or redemption or acquisition for value of any Indebtedness
subject to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments,” at the time of (or, in the case
of any calculation or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently ended
period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made at the time of) (x) delivery of irrevocable (which may be
conditional) notice with respect to such payment or prepayment or redemption or acquisition of such Indebtedness
or (y) the making of such voluntary or optional payment or prepayment on or redemption or acquisition for value of
any Indebtedness (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, for the Limited Condition Transaction (and the other transactions to
be entered into in connection therewith), Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to
take such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket, such ratio, test or
basket shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT
Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test
Date would have failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket,
including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of Parent or the Person subject to such
Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets,
tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations;
_provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if financial statements for one or more subsequent_
periods of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole
discretion, to re-determine all such financial ratios or tests, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently
ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such
date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the LCT Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and
financial metrics. If the Issuer has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection
with any calculation of any ratio, test or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or
Permitted Liens, the making of Restricted Payments, the making of any Permitted Investment, mergers, the
conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent, the prepayment, redemption,
purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of Indebtedness, or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary (each, a
“Subsequent Transaction”) following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such
Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement, public announcement or
irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, revoked or expires without consummation
of such Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining whether such Subsequent Transaction is
permitted under the Indenture, any such ratio, test or basket shall be required to be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis
assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes;

280


-----

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption, offer to purchase or otherwise) of
the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Notes;

(3) failure by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after notice by the Trustee to the
Issuer or by the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding to the Issuer and the Trustee to comply with any of the agreements in the Indenture
(other than a default referred to in clause (1) or (2) above) or the Security Documents; provided
that in the case of a failure to comply with the Indenture provisions described under “—Certain
Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach shall be 120 days after
written notice described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness
owed to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Affiliate) of Parent, any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or the Issuer (or the payment of which is
guaranteed by Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or the
Issuer), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the
Indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on any
such Indebtedness at final Stated Maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace
periods) (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express
maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with
the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates at least the
greater of (x) $325.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(5) failure by Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or the Issuer to
pay final non-appealable judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction
aggregating in excess of the greater of (x) $325.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA
(other than any judgments covered by indemnities or insurance policies issued by reputable
companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed, for a period of 60 days, after the
applicable judgment becomes final and non-appealable;

(6) except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee of Parent or a Significant Subsidiary of
Parent is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any reason to
be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of the Indenture), or Parent or any
Significant Subsidiary of Parent, or any Person acting on behalf of Parent or such Significant
Subsidiary of Parent, as applicable, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Note Guarantee
and any such Default continues for 10 days;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Indenture with respect to Parent, any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer;

(8) failure by the Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption as described under “—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption;”

(9) any material provision of any Security Document or Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the
Notes, at any time, (a) ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements or (b) is
declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) the Issuer or any
Guarantor contests in writing the validity or enforceability of any material provision of any
Security Document or Intercreditor Agreement or (z) the Issuer or any Guarantor denies in writing
that it has any further liability under the Indenture or any Security Document or Intercreditor
Agreement or gives written notice to revoke or rescind any Security Document or the perfected
first-priority or second-priority Liens, as applicable, created thereby with respect to the Notes,

281


-----

other than in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements; or

(10) any Security Document covering a material portion of the Collateral for any reason (other than
pursuant to the terms thereof) ceases to create a valid and perfected first-priority or second-priority
Lien, as applicable, on, and security interest in, any material Collateral covered thereby with
respect to the Notes, subject to Permitted Liens, except (a) to the extent that any such perfection or
priority is not required pursuant to the Indenture and the Security Documents or results from the
failure of the Notes Collateral Agent to maintain possession of certificates actually delivered to it
representing securities pledged under the Security Documents or (b) as to Collateral consisting of
real property, to the extent that such losses are covered by a title insurance policy in favor of the
Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and such
insurers have not denied or failed to acknowledge coverage.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to
either Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries of Parent that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer, all outstanding
Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee if given by holders of Notes) may declare all
the Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. In case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, for purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have directed the Trustee or the
Notes Collateral Agent, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Notes shall be calculated by
the Trustee or its agent using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such other services
as may be selected by the Trustee or its agent in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on
the date that is two business days prior to the date of such direction. The Trustee shall have no liability for making
such calculation. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of
Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to
the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in clause (4) under the first paragraph of “—
Events of Default and Remedies” (excluding any resulting payment default under the Indenture or the Notes), the
declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if such Indebtedness is paid or otherwise
acquired or retired or the holders of all Indebtedness described in clause (4) have rescinded or waived the
declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 20 business days of the date of such declaration of
acceleration of the Notes, and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any
judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of
principal or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or
waived and all amounts owing to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent have been paid.

The Indenture will provide that if a Default is deemed to occur solely as a consequence of the existence of
another Default (the “Initial Default”), then, at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default that resulted solely
because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any
holders of Notes unless such holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent, as applicable, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee and/or Notes Collateral Agent against any
loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest, if any, when due, no
holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes (subject to the Intercreditor
Agreements) unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing;

282


-----

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written
request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder or holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral
Agent security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as
applicable, against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to
the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or
Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or
interest, if any, on, the Notes (except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes that became
due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes).

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders
(other than any holder that is a Regulated Bank, an initial purchaser or its Affiliate (in each case, as evidenced by
delivery of an officer’s certificate to the Trustee from such initial purchaser or Affiliate certifying as to its status as
an initial purchaser or Affiliate thereof)) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written
representation from each such holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder
is DTC, the Common Depositary or any of their respective nominees, that such holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”),
which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default, shall be deemed repeated
at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In
addition, each Directing Holder is deemed at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction to covenant to provide the
Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such noteholder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification
_Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC, the Common Depositary or any of their respective nominees,_
any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner
of the notes in lieu of DTC, the Common Depositary or any of their respective nominees and DTC and the Common
Depositary, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification
Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that the Issuer has instituted
litigation with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the
cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending
a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the
delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an
Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with
respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of
Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy
stayed until such time as the Issuer provides the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate that the Verification Covenant
has been satisfied; provided that the Issuer shall promptly deliver such Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee upon
becoming aware that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied. Any breach of the Position Representation (as
evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee) shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes
held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly
provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event
of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have
received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default; provided, however, this shall

283


-----

not invalidate any indemnity or security provided by the Directing Holders to the Trustee which obligations shall
continue to survive.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of bankruptcy or similar
proceedings shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing two paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction,
Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officer’s Certificate or other document delivered to it pursuant to
the foregoing paragraphs, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position

Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated
Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise
and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to
the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether
any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture
or any other agreement or whether or not any holder is a Regulated Bank.

With their acquisition of the Notes, each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the
delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this provision.
Each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the
Trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the
Trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or arising out of or in
connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.

Other than in connection with actions resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
of the Trustee, the Issuer waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and agrees not to
commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for
any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or arising out of or in connection with following
instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee will treat all holders equally with respect to their rights under this
“Events of Default and Remedies” provision. In connection with the requisite percentages required under the
Indenture to exercise remedies, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat all outstanding Notes equally irrespective of any
Position Representation in determining whether the requisite percentage has been obtained with respect to the initial
delivery of the Noteholder Direction.

The Issuer agrees that any and all other actions that the Trustee takes or omits to take in connection with
the foregoing net short language and all fees, costs and expenses of the Trustee and its agents and counsel arising as
a result of, or in connection with, the application of such provision shall be covered by the Issuer’s indemnification
obligations set forth in the Indenture.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually an Officer’s Certificate regarding compliance with
the Indenture within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30,
2023). Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 30 days of becoming aware of such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has
been cured or waived within such 30 day period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of
Default, its status and what action the Issuer or any Guarantor propose to take with respect thereto.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Equity Holders, including Members**

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or equity holder, including
members, of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, as such, will have any liability
for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Note Guarantees, the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations
or their creation. Each holder of Notes by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities
under the federal securities laws.

284


-----

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may at any time elect to have all of the Issuer’s obligations discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes of a Series, all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Note Guarantees of
such Series and the Liens with respect to such Series released (“Legal Defeasance”), except for:

(1) the rights of holders of Notes of such Series to receive payments in respect of the principal of
premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the Notes of such Series when such payments are due
from the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Notes of such Series concerning issuing temporary
Notes, registration of transfer of the Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the
maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture, and the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provision of the Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including the obligation to make Change of Control Offers
and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to
comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or Event of Default with respect to a Series of Notes. In
the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all Events of Default described under “—Events of Default and Remedies”
(except those relating to payments on the Notes, covenants that are not subject to Covenant Defeasance or
bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes of such Series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to a Series of Notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the
Notes of such Series, (a) in the case of Dollar Notes, (i) cash in U.S. dollars in an amount, (ii) noncallable U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of
and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in amounts or (b) in the
case of the Euro Notes, (i) cash in euro in an amount, (ii) non-callable euro-denominated
Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and interest thereon will be in an
amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in amounts, in each case, as will be sufficient, without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment
bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium
on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the outstanding Notes of such Series to the stated date for
payment thereof or to the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and all interest, if any,
accrued to such dates, and the Issuer must specify whether the Notes of such Series are being
defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption date;

(2) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee, (a) in the case of Legal Defeasance, an opinion of counsel to
the effect that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable
U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of
counsel will confirm, that the beneficial owners of outstanding Notes of such Series will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not
occurred; and (b) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, an opinion of counsel to the effect the
beneficial owners of outstanding Notes of such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been in the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such

285


-----

deposit (and any similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of
Liens to secure such borrowings);

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Indenture and the
agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which
the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is a party or by which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is
bound;

(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made
by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes of such Series over the other
creditors of the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors
of the Issuer or others; and

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance
have been complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as otherwise provided in this “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”, the Indenture, the Escrow
Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Notes or the Note Guarantees may be
amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes other than Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes), and any existing Default or Event of
Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest,
if any, on, the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance
with any provision of the Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements,
the Notes or the Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes other than Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates
(including, without limitation, Additional Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation,
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that (x) if
any such amendment or waiver will only affect one Series of Notes (or less than all Series of Notes) then
outstanding under the Indenture, then only the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes
of such Series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or waiver by its terms
will affect a Series of Notes in a manner different and materially adverse relative to the manner such amendment or
waiver affects other Series of Notes, then the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes of
such Series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for Notes) shall be required.

Without the consent of each holder of the then outstanding Notes affected, an amendment, supplement or
waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement
or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Note or alter or waive any of the
provisions relating to the dates on which the Notes may be redeemed or the redemption price
thereof with respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than any change to the notice periods
with respect to such redemption);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any
Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest,
if any, on, the Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of a series of Notes by the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

286


-----

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the
rights of holders of Notes to receive payments of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if
any, on, the Notes;

(7) subject to the final paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,”
modify the obligation of the Issuer to repurchase Notes under “—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders,” after the date of an event giving rise to such repurchase obligation;

(8) release Parent or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from any of its obligations under
its Note Guarantee or the Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions;

(10) make any change to, or modify, the ranking of the Notes in respect of right of payment in a
manner that would adversely affect the holders of the Notes; or

(11) waive or modify in a manner materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes the
provisions relating to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory
Redemption.

In addition, without the consent of the holders of at least 66[2]/3% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer
or exchange offer for, the Notes), no amendment, supplement or waiver may (1) have the effect of releasing all or
substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens created pursuant to the Security Documents (except as permitted by
the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements) or changing or altering the
priority of the security interests of the holders of the Notes in the Collateral under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement
or the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, (2) make any change in the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreements or the provisions in the Indenture dealing with the application of proceeds of the Collateral that would
adversely affect the holders of the Notes or (3) modify the Security Documents or the provisions of the Indenture
dealing with Collateral in any manner adverse to the holders of the Notes in any material respect other than in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements; provided that
(x) if any such amendment, supplement or waiver will only affect one series of Notes (or less than all series of the
Notes) then outstanding under the Indenture, then only the consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Notes) shall be required.

A Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or its respective Affiliates hold the Note;
_provided that in determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes_
have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under the Indenture, Notes
beneficially owned by the Issuer or its respective Affiliates shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors and
the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Indenture, the Escrow
Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Notes or the Note Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to holders of Notes
and Note Guarantees in the case of a merger, consolidation, amalgamation or Division or sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Notes or
that does not adversely affect the rights under the Indenture of any holder in any material respect;

(5) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable;

287


-----

(6) to conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes, the Note Guarantees, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreements or the Escrow Agreement to any provision of this “Description of
Notes”;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with the limitations set forth in the
Indenture;

(8) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Note Guarantee with respect
to the Notes, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements in accordance with the terms
of the Indenture;

(9) to add or release Note Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Indenture and to make,
complete or confirm any grant of Collateral permitted or required by the Indenture or any of the
Security Documents or Intercreditor Agreements, or any release of Collateral pursuant to the terms
of the Indenture or any of the Security Documents or Intercreditor Agreements;

(10) to secure additional extensions of credit and add additional secured creditors holding other Parity
Lien Indebtedness so long as such Parity Lien Indebtedness is not prohibited by the provisions of
the Indenture or any other then-existing Parity Lien Indebtedness; or

(11) to add additional assets as Collateral.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. Until an
amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a holder is a continuing consent by such holder and every
subsequent holder of all or part of the related Note. Any such holder or subsequent holder may revoke such consent
as to its Notes by written notice to the Trustee or the Issuer, received thereby before the date on which holders of the
requisite principal amount of Notes have consented to such amendment or waiver.

In addition, the holders will be deemed to have consented for purposes of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements to any of the following amendments and other modifications to the Security Documents or
Intercreditor Agreements:

(1) (a) to add other parties (or any authorized agent thereof or trustee therefor) holding Parity Lien
Indebtedness that is incurred in compliance with the ABL Credit Agreement, the Term Loan
Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures, the Indenture, the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements and (b) to establish that the Liens on any Collateral securing such Parity
Lien Indebtedness shall be pari passu under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement with the Liens
on such Collateral securing the Obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note
Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement in effect
immediately prior to such amendment or other modification;

(2) to establish that the Liens on any Collateral securing any Indebtedness replacing the Term Loan
Credit Agreement or the Existing Secured Indentures permitted to be incurred under the Indenture
shall be pari passu to the Liens on such Collateral securing any Obligations under the Indenture,
the Notes and the Note Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement in effect immediately prior to such amendment or other modification;

(3) to establish that the Liens on any Current Asset Collateral securing any Indebtedness replacing the
ABL Credit Agreement permitted to be incurred under the Indenture shall be senior to the Liens
on such Current Asset Collateral securing any Obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the
Note Guarantees, and that the Liens on any Fixed Asset Collateral securing any such Indebtedness
shall be junior to the Liens on such Fixed Asset Collateral securing any Obligations under the
Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior to such amendment or other modification; and

(4) upon any cancellation or termination of the ABL Credit Agreement without a replacement thereof,
to establish that the Current Asset Collateral (in addition to the Fixed Asset Collateral) shall secure
the Obligations under the Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees on a first-priority basis,

288


-----

subject to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior to such
amendment or other modification.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment, waiver, modification or deletion of the provisions described
under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,”
shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of any
payment on or with respect to, or to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements with respect to a Series of Notes
will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to the Notes of such Series issued thereunder (except for
certain rights of the Trustee, which shall survive) and any Collateral then securing the Notes of such Series shall be
automatically released, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Notes of such Series that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen
or destroyed Notes of such Series that have been replaced or paid and Notes of such
Series for whose payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the
Issuer or discharged from such trust, have been cancelled or delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or

(b) all such Notes of such Series not previously delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation have become due and payable, will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year or have been called for redemption or are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving
of a notice of redemption in the name and at the expense of the Issuer and the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee in a
manner that is not revocable, (a) in the case of Dollar Notes, (i) cash in U.S. dollars in an
amount, (ii) non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled
payments of principal of and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination
thereof in an amount, or (b) in the case of the Euro Notes, (i) cash in euro in an amount,
(ii) non-callable euro-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of
principal of and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in an
amount, in each case, as will be sufficient (in the case that Government Securities have
been deposited, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm
or firm of independent public accountants certified in writing to the Trustee), without
consideration of any reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire
Indebtedness on the Notes of such Series for principal of, premium on, if any, and
interest, if any, on, the Notes of such Series to the date of maturity or redemption;

(2) the Issuer, Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has paid or caused to be paid all sums then due and
payable by the Issuer and Guarantors under the Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the
deposited money toward the payment of the Notes of such Series to maturity or to the redemption
date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Calculation of U.S. Dollar-Denominated Restrictions**

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction herein, the U.S. dollar equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-U.S. dollar currency shall be calculated using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or
such other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date such non-U.S. dollar amount is incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Concerning the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Indenture will contain provisions that
limit the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received
in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions
with the Issuer and the Guarantors; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest as defined in the Trust Indenture
Act it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee (if
the Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes will have the right to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee
or the Notes Collateral Agent, subject to certain exceptions. The Indenture will provide that in case an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and powers under
the Indenture, to use the same degree of care in their exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, neither the Trustee nor the Notes
Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Indenture at the
request or direction of any holder of Notes, unless such holder has offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee
and/or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee or the Notes
Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense.

Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be responsible for, and make no representation as
to the existence, genuineness, value or protection of, any Collateral, for the legality, effectiveness or sufficiency of
any Security Document or for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any Liens securing the
Notes. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be responsible for filing any financing or
continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or
otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any Lien or security interest in the Collateral.

By their acceptance of the Notes, the holders of the Notes will be deemed to have authorized the Notes
Collateral Agent to enter into and to perform each of the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements,
including any amendments or supplements thereto permitted by the Indenture.

**Maintenance of Listing**

After the Issue Date, the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the
listing of the Euro Notes on the Exchange for so long as the Euro Notes are outstanding; provided that if the Issuer is
unable to obtain admission to listing of the Euro Notes on the Exchange or if at any time the Issuer determines in its
sole discretion that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (prior to the
delisting of the Euro Notes in the event that they were previously listed on the Exchange) obtain a listing of the Euro
Notes on another “recognized stock exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United
Kingdom (in which case, references in this covenant to the Exchange will be deemed to be refer to such other
“recognized stock exchange”). In no event will this covenant require the Issuer to obtain or maintain the listing of
the Euro Notes on any exchange that requires financial reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal
periods required by the Commission.

**Governing Law; Jury Trial Waiver**

The Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. The Security Documents will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York; however, the mortgages will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the state in which the applicable Premises is located. The Indenture
provides that the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee, and each holder of a Note by its acceptance thereof,
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to the Indenture, the Notes or any transaction contemplated thereby.

The Issuer has not qualified and does not expect to qualify the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. The
Indenture will accordingly not be subject to the Trust Indenture Act, and may not contain provisions corresponding
or similar to certain provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that would otherwise apply if the Indenture were so
qualified, including §314(a) and §316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

taken on or prior to, or to be taken by Parent (or any successor thereto) or any Restricted Subsidiary within 24
months of, the date of such pro forma calculation, net of the amount of actual benefits realized or expected to be
realized during such period that are otherwise included in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA from such
action; provided that (i) such cost savings, expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies are
reasonably identifiable (as determined in good faith by a responsible financial or accounting officer, in his or her

months after the date of the relevant action or event or after the consummation of any change that is expected to
result in such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements or synergies, (ii) the aggregate
amount added in respect of the foregoing (or otherwise added to Consolidated Net Income or Consolidated
EBITDA) shall no longer be permitted to be added back to the extent the cost savings, operating expense reductions,
operating improvements and synergies have not been achieved within 24 months of the action or event giving rise to
such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies and (iii) no cost savings,
expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies shall be added pursuant to this definition to the extent

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on
Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”) under the Securities Act will be initially represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the
Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Notes representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes”) will
be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of
DTC. On the Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro Rule 144A Global
Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the
United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be initially represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Notes
representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the
custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Regulation
S Global Note representing the Euro Notes (the “Euro Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance
with the Common Depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the
nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, in the case of the
Dollar Global Notes, and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, or persons that hold
interests such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the Indenture
and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in the book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their respective participants, as applicable. The
Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and minimum denominations of
€100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with
the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
“holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or the Common Depositary for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered to be the sole holder
of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor the Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered Notes in
certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) if:

    - DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
depositary for the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor; or

333


-----

    - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either DTC,
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered
form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of
the owner(s) of the Book-Entry Interest and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon
directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such
Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend is
not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustee, the paying agent, the registrar and the transfer agent
shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be
liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer or as otherwise provided in the Indenture, and
such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of
the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to the Dollar Notes) and
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a
Definitive Registered Note relating to the Euro Notes).

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, we will issue and the Trustee (or its appointed
agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our requirements are met. We
or the Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity
bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Trustee and us to protect us, the Trustee, the paying agent and the
registrar appointed pursuant to the Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered
Note is replaced. We may charge for the expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture,
we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase such
Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only in accordance with the Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the
transfer restrictions applicable to the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominees), as applicable will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary
will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common
Depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustee to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to
reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the
amount received by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and/or

334


-----

Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by
lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational
procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount (in the case of
the Dollar Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) at maturity may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any,
interest and additional interest, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the paying agent, which will in turn make such
payments to DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will distribute such payments to participants
in accordance with its customary procedures.

Under the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the registrar, the transfer agent and the paying
agent will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustee, the registrar, the transfer agent or the paying agent or any of
our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant or
indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or any
participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

    - the records of the custodian or Common Depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations
of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the paying agent, the transfer
agent, the registrar or the initial purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any
currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign
exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global Notes will be paid to holders of
interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in Euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves the right to
exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to
their respective participants.

335


-----

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures
may change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any
reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed in “Notice to
Investors.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or Rule
144A under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange.”
Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a BookEntry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and
accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a
Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note
and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form
provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions
applicable to the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Notices**

So long as the Global Notes are held on behalf of a clearing system, notices required to be given to
noteholders may be given by their being delivered to that clearing system and will be deemed to have been given to
the noteholders on the date of delivery to such clearing system.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the
respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Trustee, the paying agent, the
registrar, the transfer agent or the initial purchasers take any responsibility for these operations or procedures and we
urge investors to contact DTC or its participants directly to discuss these matters.

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by DTC
and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee, the paying agent, the transfer
agent, the registrar nor any of our or their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking
Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve
System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing

336


-----

agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides
asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market
instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement
amongst direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic
computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC,
National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered
clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also
available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and
clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Euro Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear
or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered
form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders
on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests in respect of the Euro Notes will trade through participants of Euroclear or
Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to
establish at the time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open
for business.

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may

337


-----

find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or
in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

338

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential U.S. federal income tax effects. The effects of U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not
discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of
the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing
interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could
adversely affect a holder. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a position contrary to that discussed
below regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to Notes held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to Notes purchased for cash at
original issue and at their “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which
a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash (other than sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar
persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers)). This discussion
does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including
the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the impact of the requirement under
Section 451(b) of the Code on certain holders to conform the timing of income accruals with respect to the Notes to
such holders’ applicable financial statements. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders
subject to special rules, including, without limitation:

    - former U.S. citizens or former long-term residents of the United States;

    - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

    - U.S. Holders (as defined herein) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

    - U.S. Holders that hold their Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries;

    - persons holding Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a
conversion transaction or other integrated investment;

    - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

    - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

    - brokers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

    - traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities
holdings;

    - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

    - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or S corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes
(and investors therein);

    - tax-exempt entities or governmental entities; and

    - persons deemed to sell Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of such
partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, any entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes considering an investment in the Notes and the partners in such
partnership should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.**
**PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE**
**APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS**
**AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF**
**THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT**
**TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR**
**UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.**

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be obligated to pay amounts with respect to the Notes in excess of
the stated interest and principal payable on the Notes, or to make payments on the Notes in advance of their
scheduled payment dates (see “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and
“Description of Notes—Repurchase at the option of Holders—Change of Control”). These obligations may
implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” Although the
issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the Notes should not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination will be binding on a holder unless such holder explicitly
discloses on a statement attached to the holder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the
acquisition date of the Notes that such holder’s determination is different. Our determination, however, is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenges this position, and the Notes are treated as contingent payment
debt instruments because of such contingencies, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation might, among other
things, be required to accrue interest income on the Notes at a higher rate than the stated rate of interest on the Notes
and to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as
capital gain. This discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.

**_Effect of Escrow Release and Related Transactions_**

As described in “Description of Notes,” if this offering closes prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes
into separate segregated escrow accounts, which will be released and used as part of the financing for the
Transactions and for the other purposes described further in “Use of Proceeds.” As part of consummation of the
Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will merge with and into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately
continuing as the surviving entity and assuming the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the
Indenture. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and the remainder of this
discussion assumes, that the transactions that will occur in connection with the Escrow Release of the offering
proceeds and the Escrow Merger should not result in a taxable event to holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If this position is respected, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation would not recognize any income, gain
or loss in connection with such transactions. It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view and seek
to treat such holders as exchanging the Notes for “new” Notes in a deemed taxable exchange for U.S. federal income
tax purposes. If the IRS successfully asserted that position, such holders would be required to recognize any gain or
loss in connection with such exchange and would have a new holding period and a new tax basis in the “new” Notes
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, such “new” Notes may have OID. U.S. Holders should consult
their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of the transactions related to the
release of the escrow proceeds and the Escrow Merger.

**Tax Consequences Applicable to U.S. Holders**

**_Definition of a U.S. Holder_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is or is treated as:

    - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

    - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District
of Columbia;

    - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

    - a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court over its administration and with
respect to which one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of
the Code) have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (2) has a valid election in
effect to be treated as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Stated Interest_**

The stated interest on a Note generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time such
interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax accounting for U.S.
federal income tax purposes.

U.S. Holders of Euro Notes will be subject to additional rules relating to the receipt of foreign currency. A
U.S. Holder of Euro Notes that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income the
U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest payment on the Euro Notes (including any amounts received
upon the Disposition (as defined below) of a Euro Note that are attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest)
based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into
U.S. dollars on such date. Such a cash-method U.S. Holder generally will not recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment on the Euro Notes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on the Euro Notes
in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

    - The average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof within the
taxable year, in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year; or

    - At such U.S. Holder’s election, the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or in
the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year, the last day of the portion of the
accrual period within each taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business
days of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S.
Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

Such a U.S. Holder using the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference (if any) between (i) the value of the euros
received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt and (ii) the
U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange
gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss but generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest
income received on the Euro Notes.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition_**

Subject to the special rules discussed below with respect to foreign currency, a U.S. Holder will generally
recognize a gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (a
“Disposition”) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received for the Note in cash or other property
valued at fair market value (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable
as interest to the extent not previously included in taxable income) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. Holder paid for the
Note. Subject to the discussion of foreign currency gain or loss with respect to Euro Notes below, any gain or loss

341


-----

will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more
than one year at the time of the Disposition and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital
gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at a reduced rate.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Dollar Note generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. Holder
paid for the Dollar Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Euro Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro
purchase price, as applicable, calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase.

If there is a Disposition of a Euro Note for an amount denominated in euro, a U.S. Holder’s amount
realized generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euro received in such Disposition (less any amounts
attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously
included in taxable income), calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of the Disposition. If the
Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market (as determined under applicable Treasury regulations), a
cash-method U.S. Holder is required to determine the U.S. dollar value of the euro received in such Disposition by
translating the euro received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the Disposition, and an accrualmethod U.S. Holder may elect the same treatment for the euro received. This election by accrual-method U.S.
Holders must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss upon the Disposition of a Euro Note as a result
of fluctuations in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Gain or loss attributable to such fluctuations will equal the
difference (if any) between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price of the Euro Note,
determined using the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder acquired the Euro Note, and (ii) the U.S.
dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price in euro of the Euro Note, determined using the spot rate of exchange
on the date of the Disposition of the Euro Note (or, possibly in the case of a cash-method U.S. Holder or an electing
accrual-method U.S. Holder, if the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market (as determined under
applicable Treasury regulations), the spot rates of exchange on the settlement date of such Disposition). The foreign
currency gain or loss (together with any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to accrued but unpaid stated
interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the Disposition
of the Euro Note. Any such foreign currency gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or loss.

**_Transactions in Euros_**

Euros received as interest on, or on a Disposition of, the Euro Notes, as applicable, will generally have a
tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time such amount is received. The amount of gain or loss recognized
on a Disposition of such euros will be equal to the difference between (1) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair
market value in U.S. dollars of the other property received in such Disposition, and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis in such euros. Any such gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder that purchases the Euro Notes with previously owned euros will generally recognize gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such euros and the
U.S. dollar fair market value of such Euro Notes on the date of purchase. Any such gain or loss generally will be
ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. The conversion of U.S. dollars to
euros and the immediate use of such euros to purchase the Euro Notes generally will not result in any exchange gain
or loss for a U.S. Holder.

**_Reportable Transaction Reporting_**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in a “reportable transaction”(as
defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure statement on IRS
Form 8886. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from
the Euro Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax reporting obligations, if any, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886, with respect to the ownership or Disposition of the Euro Notes or any related
transaction such as the receipt of stated interest or a Disposition of any euros received in respect of the Euro Notes
and the substantial penalties for non-compliance.

342


-----

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting on payments of stated interest on a Note and
proceeds from the Disposition of a Note. A U.S. Holder may be subject to backup withholding (currently at a rate of
24%) in respect of payments of the forgoing amounts if such holder is not otherwise exempt and:

    - the holder fails to furnish the holder’s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is
ordinarily his or her social security number;

    - the holder furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;

    - the applicable withholding agent is notified by the IRS that the holder has become subject to backup
withholding because such holder previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends;
or

    - the holder fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer
identification number and that the IRS has not notified the holder that the holder is subject to backup
withholding.

Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt
organizations.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their
qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.

**Tax Consequences Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, interest paid on a Note to a Non-U.S.
Holder that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United
States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax provided that:

    - the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own stock possessing 10% or more of the
total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of the Issuer;

    - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual or
constructive stock ownership; and

    - either (1) the Non-U.S. Holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent
under penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person and provides its name and address; (2) a
securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in
the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the Note on behalf of the Non-U.S. Holder
certifies to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the financial
institution between it and the Non-U.S. Holder, has received from the Non-U.S. Holder a statement
under penalties of perjury that such holder is not a United States person and provides a copy of such
statement to the applicable withholding agent; or (3) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its Note directly
through a “qualified intermediary” (within the meaning of applicable Treasury regulations) and certain
conditions are satisfied.

If a Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the requirements above, interest paid on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder
that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States
will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to a reduction in or an
exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable income tax treaty. To claim such

343


-----

entitlement, the Non-U.S. Holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form
W-8 BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from
withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the
Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.

If interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade
or business within the United States, the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be exempt from U.S. federal withholding
tax, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. To claim the exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder must
furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable documentation),
certifying that interest paid on a Note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the
Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

Any effectively connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income
basis at the regular graduated rates, in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a
branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively
connected earnings and profits, as adjusted for certain items.

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the
payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable
withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for an exemption from withholding, or a reduced
rate of withholding, under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by
timely filing a valid claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any Disposition (excluding any amount allocable to
accrued and unpaid interest, which generally will be treated as interest subject to the rules discussed above in “—
Payments of Interest”) unless:

    - the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
United States; or

    - the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year of the Disposition and certain other requirements are met.

Any gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a
net income basis at the regular graduated rates, in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder,
unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be
subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on
its effectively connected earnings and profits, as adjusted for certain items.

Any gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), but may be offset by certain U.S. source
capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder, if any (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United
States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax treaties that may
provide for different rules.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest generally will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the Non-U.S. Holder
certifies its non-U.S. status as described above under “—Payments of Interest.” However, information returns are
required to be filed with the IRS with respect to any interest paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any
tax was actually withheld.

Proceeds of the Disposition of a Note may be subject to backup withholding and/or information reporting,
unless the applicable withholding agent receives the statement described above or the holder otherwise establishes

344


-----

an exemption. However, a Disposition of a Note paid outside the United States and conducted through a non-U.S.
office of a non-U.S. broker without certain specified connections to the United States generally will not be subject to
backup withholding or information reporting.

Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions
of an applicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is
established.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_FATCA_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and related U.S. Treasury guidance, commonly known
as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), interest on the Notes received by non-U.S. financial
institutions and certain non-U.S. non-financial entities (including, in some instances, where such an institution or
entity is acting as an intermediary) may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30% unless, in each
case, such institutions and entities satisfy certain reporting, compliance and withholding requirements. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements.

Under proposed Treasury regulations, gross proceeds from a Disposition of Notes (including a retirement
or redemption of Notes) are not subject to FATCA withholding. In its preamble to such proposed Treasury
regulations, the IRS has stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed Treasury regulations until final
Treasury regulations are issued.

Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding
under FATCA to their investment in the Notes.

345


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition of the Notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975
of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar
to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, or any Similar Law (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation
to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the
ERISA Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm
that such acquisition and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other
violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or whether an exemption would be applicable to any such purchase
of Notes. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any Guarantors or any of
their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan
with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide
impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and
materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not
directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment
in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each
prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed
present. The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan
and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and
a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or
disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without
limitation, the Issuer the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified
person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or
holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an initial purchaser or a Guarantor is
considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

346


-----

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”)
that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or
holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers,
although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. In addition to
the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code exempt certain transactions
between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or
an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any
investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction) solely by reason of
providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no
more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not,
however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that
even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these
exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any
other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable.
There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,
may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a
governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its
counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if
necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the
Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or
holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or violation of
any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with
their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such
investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules
of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to
whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for any Plan in general or whether such investment is appropriate
for any particular Plan.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by the acquisition and/or holding of a Note, or any interest in a Note, each purchaser and
subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) such purchaser or subsequent
transferee is not acquiring or holding the Notes for or on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Note, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of, any Plan or (ii)(a)
the acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Note by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation
under any applicable Similar Laws and (b) none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary to such purchaser or
transferee or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.

otherwise transferred except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and in
each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (5) below.

(2) You acknowledge that this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from

(4) You acknowledge that neither we nor the initial purchasers nor any person representing us or the
initial purchasers have made any representation to you with respect to us or the offering of the Notes, other than the
information contained in this offering memorandum. Accordingly, you acknowledge that no representation or
warranty is made by the initial purchasers as to the accuracy or completeness of such materials. You represent that
you are relying only on this offering memorandum in making your investment decision with respect to the Notes.
You agree that you have had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as you have

that the disposition of your property or the property of that investor account or accounts be at all times within your

within the seller or account’s control and to compliance with any applicable state
securities laws. You will notify any subsequent purchaser, and each subsequent purchaser
is required to notify any subsequent purchaser from it, of the resale restrictions set forth
in the preceding sentence.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined herein) may continue until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate of the

transfer of Notes under clauses (d) and (e) above the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee; and

PROVISIONS OF ERISA OR THE CODE (COLLECTIVELY, “SIMILAR LAWS”), OR OF
AN ENTITY WHOSE UNDERLYING ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO INCLUDE
“PLAN ASSETS” OF ANY SUCH PLAN, ACCOUNT OR ARRANGEMENT, OR (2)(A)
THE ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND SUBSEQUENT DISPOSITION OF THIS
SECURITY BY SUCH HOLDER WILL NOT CONSTITUTE A NON-EXEMPT
PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF
THE CODE OR A SIMILAR VIOLATION UNDER ANY APPLICABLE SIMILAR LAWS

behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by you to acquire or hold the Notes, or any interest therein, constitutes
assets of, any Plan or (ii)(a) the acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Notes by you will not
constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar

customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article
4(1) of MiFID II.

(10) You represent that you are not a “retail investor” in the United Kingdom. For purposes of this
paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of:

(a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms
part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended; or

of UK MiFIR.

(11) You understand and acknowledge that:

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

BofA Securities, Inc. and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as representatives of each of the initial
purchasers of the Dollar Notes listed below (the “Dollar Notes Representatives”) and Merrill Lynch International
and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are acting as representatives of each of the initial purchasers of the Euro Notes
listed below (the “Euro Notes Representatives” and, together with the Dollar Notes Representatives, the
“representatives”). Subject to the terms and conditions of a purchase agreement, dated the date of this offering
memorandum, by and among the Issuer and the representatives, on behalf of each initial purchaser listed in the table
below, each initial purchaser has severally and not jointly agreed to purchase from the Issuer, and the Issuer has
agreed to sell to such initial purchaser, the principal amount of the Notes of the applicable series set forth opposite
its name below.


**Principal Amount** **Principal Amount**

**Initial Purchasers** **of Dollar Notes** **of Euro Notes**

BofA Securities, Inc. ...................................................... $ €
Merrill Lynch International ............................................
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ...........................................
BMO Capital Markets Corp. ..........................................
HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ..........................................
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. ........................................
Citigroup Global Markets Inc. .......................................
Citigroup Global Markets Limited. ................................
Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. .......................................
Nomura Securities International, Inc. ............................
Total ............................................................................... $ €

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers are subject to certain
conditions precedent and that the initial purchasers are committed, severally and not jointly, to take and pay for all
of the Notes, if any are taken. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase
commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be
terminated. The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed, to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities
in connection with this offering, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the
initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

**Commissions and Discounts**

We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they initially propose to offer and sell each series of
Notes at the offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. If all of the Notes of a series are
not sold at the initial offering price, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and other selling terms
without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates or other registered
broker-dealers or selling agents.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities law and
may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the
Notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A, or
pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be
deemed to have made by its purchase certain acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set
forth under “Notice to Investors.”

In connection with sales outside of the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not
offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as a part of the initial purchasers’
distribution at any time or (2) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date
the Notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such Notes in
reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on

352


-----

offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms
used in this paragraph have the meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of the Restricted Period referred to in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” an
offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance
with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**New Issue of Notes**

Each series of Notes will be a new issue of notes for which there is currently no public trading market. The
Issuer does not intend to list the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. The Issuer
intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange following the consummation of this offering. There is no
assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to
trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of
the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to
trading. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that following the completion of this offering, they
presently intend to make a market in the Notes after the completion of the offering. They are not obligated to do so,
however, and the ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may be impacted by changes in any
regulatory requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to,
the Notes (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under
the Exchange Act and its application to debt securities). Any market-making activities with respect to the Notes may
be discontinued at any time without any notice. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance as to the development of
any market or the liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop,
the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a
discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, or
our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. Also, the offering
of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right
to reject any order in whole or in part. The Notes will trade separately from the Existing Notes, will have a different
ISIN and CUSIP than the Existing Notes and will not be fungible with the Existing Notes.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or
otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may overallot this offering, creating a
syndicate short position. The initial purchasers may bid for and purchase the Notes in the open market to cover
syndicate short positions. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase the Notes in the open market to
stabilize the price of the Notes. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above the
price that would otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any
representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may
have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that
the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum,
without first obtaining the prior written consent of the representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to
contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the Notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the
purchase agreement.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, investment banking and commercial banking, financial advisory,
lending, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage
activities. Certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed,
currently perform, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for us,
for which they have received customary compensation and may provide such services and receive customary

353


-----

compensation in the future. Certain of the relationships involve transactions that are material to us or our affiliates
and for which the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have received significant fees.

An affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. acts as administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement, an
affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC acts as an administrative agent under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and,
in each case, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates act as lenders under the Credit Agreements. In
addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be lenders under the Existing Diversey Credit
Agreement and will be entitled to receive customary fees in connection therewith and may receive a portion of the
proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to repay such indebtedness. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers
and/or their affiliates may be holders of the Existing Diversey Notes and may receive a portion of the proceeds of
the offering of the Notes used to redeem such indebtedness. In addition, the initial purchasers or their affiliates have
made commitments to us with respect to a senior secured bridge facility to finance a portion of the Acquisition.
These commitments under such bridge facility will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross cash
proceeds of this offering. Affiliates of certain initial purchasers may also participate in the offering of the Notes.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their respective customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of
the Issuer. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold,
or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge,
and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of
short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which will be the     business day following the date of this offering
memorandum (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+    ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two
business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in
T+    , to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes during such period should consult their own advisors.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently, no key information document
required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the
basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Regulation from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum
is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the UK. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as
it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the
“EUWA”), and as amended; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as
a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (“UK MiFIR”). Consequently no key information document
required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as
amended (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful. This offering memorandum
has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the UK will be made pursuant to an exemption under
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (the “UK
Prospectus Regulation”) and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This
offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

This document is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”),
(ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”)
of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the UK, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement
to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the issue or
sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons
together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This document is directed only at relevant persons and must not be
acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this
document relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs only Target Market**

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of any initial purchaser that considers itself a

##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]                        

###### Note 1  Business Background

 General Description of the Business
 Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. (hereafter "Olympus" or "the Company"), doing business as "Solenis" from November 9, 2021, is an exempted limited partnership registered and domiciled under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Olympus and several other holding companies and partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC ("Platinum"), all of which are organized under Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P, a Cayman exempted limited partnership. 
 The Company was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of consummating the purchase of the Consolidated Operations of Solenis UK International Limited (the "Acquisition" or the "Transaction"). The Company also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of receiving the contribution of Innovative Water Global Corporation (doing business as "Sigura", i.e. the "Contribution") immediately subsequent to the Acquisition on November 9, 2021.
 Accordingly, the conclusion of the Acquisition and Contribution results in the consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses (under the Solenis umbrella) from November 9, 2021 within these financial statements as presented under the "Successor" periods.
 Olympus was formed under a group of holding companies. Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings II, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership. Olympus Water Holdings II L.P. holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings III, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership. Olympus Water Holdings III holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus. These holding companies and partnerships are collectively referred to as the "Holding Companies". The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above. 
 Olympus owns 100% of the shares of Olympus Water US Holding Corporation domiciled in the United States of America (the "US"), and 100% of the shares of Olympus Water UK Holding Limited domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the "UK");
 Olympus Water US Holding Corporation owns 100% of the equity interest of Solenis Holdings LLC domiciled in the US, and all of its wholly-owned direct subsidiaries;
 Acquisition of Solenis and Contribution of Sigura
 On November 9, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the Solenis business pursuant to the terms of the SPA, dated July 3, 2021, between CD&R Seahawk Holdings, L.P. BASF Nederland B.V., and Solenis UK International Limited (the “Agreement”).

###### Immediately following the acquisition of Solenis, the Contribution was effectuated for a value of $500.0 million.  The contribution was made from Platinum Equity Fund IV ("Fund IV"; which had owned 100% of the Sigura business) to Platinum Equity Fund V ("Fund V"). In consideration of the Contribution, Fund IV obtained a minority equity position in the combined business controlled by Fund V (which controls Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.). 
 The Acquisition and Contribution were both separately determined to represent an accounting change of control and are accounted for as business combinations under ASC 805 using the acquisition method of accounting.
 The following table summarizes the fair values of the net assets acquired as of the November 9, 2021 Acquisition and Contribution dates ($ in thousands):

###### The financial statements have been presented on a comparative basis. For periods prior to the Acquisition, the Company is referred to as the Predecessor where as periods subsequent to the Acquisition are referred to as the Successor. Due to the Acquisition and the application of "push-down accounting", different bases of accounting have been used to prepare the Predecessor and Successor financial statements. A "black-line" separates the Predecessor and Successor financial statements to highlight the lack of comparability between these periods.
 Nature of Operations
 Solenis is a leading supplier of specialty chemicals and services to the pulp and paper, mining, food and beverage, power generation, refining, chemical processing, general manufacturing, municipal and pools markets. It offers chemical and equipment technologies and services designed to help customers improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect plant assets and minimize environmental impact. 

 Solenis has 49 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries. The Company markets and distributes its products and services directly and through third-party distributors in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.

 Solenis’ business principally consists of three operating segments: (1) Consumer, (2) Industrial (which integrates Solenis's prior Industrial Water business and the operating results of its Reverse Supply Agreements with BASF as well as Sigura's Industrial business) and (3) Pools. A brief description for each of these operating segments is as follows:

 Consumer Solutions – The Consumer ("CS") business manufactures and sells a broad array of process chemistry for the pulp and paper industry. These products are designed to deliver benefits such as enhanced operational efficiencies, system cleanliness and superior performance in a wide variety of manufacturing operations globally.
 Industrial Solutions – The Industrial Water ("IS") business offers specialized chemicals for the utility water treatment market including influent water, boiler water, cooling water and effluent water treatments and process additives.
 Pools - The Pools Solutions ("PS") business offers water care products and value-added services offered for residential and commercial pools and spas in consumer channels such as Mass Retail, Professional Dealer and Commercial and services top consumer brands in pool care markets.
 Solenis’ results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, can have a significant effect on operations. While Solenis maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Solenis could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to environmental remediation or other matters.

###### Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies

##### Our significant accounting policies are those that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, as well as those that involve significant judgments or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022.

###### Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

 Cash and cash equivalents represent cash deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash which has a legal restriction regarding its use or withdrawal is classified as Restricted cash and is classified as Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The below table reconciles Cash and cash equivalents to Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 (amounts in thousands):

**As of March 31,** **As of March 31,**

**2023** **2022**

Cash and cash equivalents, as reported $ 187,190 $ 144,230

Restricted cash, included in other assets 3,997 1,724

Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 191,187 $ 145,954

###### Announced Accounting Standards
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The guidance requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, but early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact this standard would have on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to the Company's processes around the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables.
 In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-07, "Compensation - Stock Compensation - Determining the Current Price of an Underlying Share". The guidance allows a nonpublic entity to determine the current price input of equity-classified share-based awards issued to both employees and non-employees using the reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method. The guidance is effective prospectively for all qualifying awards granted or modified during fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

|2023|2022|
|---|---|
|Cash and cash equivalents, as reported $ 187,190 Restricted cash, included in other assets 3,997|$ 144,230 1,724|
|Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 191,187|$ 145,954|


-----

##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]                        

###### In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-09, "Discount Rate for Lessees That Are Not Public Business Entities". Topic 842 currently provides lessees that are not public business entities with a practical expedient that allows them to elect, as an accounting policy, to use a risk free rate as the discount rate for all leases. The amendments in this Update allow those lessees to make the risk-free rate election by class of underlying asset, rather than at the entity-wide level. An entity that makes the risk-free rate election is required to disclose which asset classes it has elected to apply a risk-free rate. The amendments require that when the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable for any individual lease, the lessee use that rate (rather than a risk free rate or an incremental borrowing rate), regardless of whether it has made the risk-free rate election. For entities that have adopted Topic 842 as of November 11, 2021, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.
 In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, "Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations". The purpose of this ASU is to provide transparency around supplier related financing given the lack of current explicit disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard.
 Note 3  Revenue Recognition

 Solenis provides specialty chemical solutions designed to help improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect existing assets, and mitigate environmental impact. The Company has a broad product portfolio across its three segments with a large customer and end-market footprint. In addition to its product portfolio, Solenis also provides support services via its service engineers and application experts and provides access to chemical feed equipment as needed. 
 The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are fulfilled which is when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Solenis allocates the overall contractual consideration to each performance obligation using stand-alone selling prices when available, or will allocate consideration in the absence of stand-alone selling prices by estimating the cost of fulfilling a performance obligation and applying a markup based upon market-participant expectations. Based on the nature of the Company's operations and the structure of its customer contracts, performance obligations are typically fulfilled commensurate with the delivery of product. 
 Solenis' limited number of existing long-term contracts, reliance on accepted purchase orders to determine transaction price, and terms and conditions which require payment upon the fulfillment of product specific performance obligations, limits the potential for material contract assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022 the Company has recorded contract assets and liabilities of $0.

###### below, Solenis entered into a long-term supply agreement with Kolb to ensure continuity of supply as the manufacturing facilities supplying finished goods to the acquired customers were retained by Kolb. 

 The company has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and has preliminarily allocated the fair value of the consideration transferred (cash of $20.0 million; no other consideration transferred) based on management's estimates of fair value. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, $0 of which is deductible for tax purposes. Residual goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired, which cannot be individually identified and separately recognized. The fair values of intangible assets were estimated using an income approach, with the excess earnings method used for customer relationships and the relief from royalty method used for trademarks and tradenames.  Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. Adjustments to these measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as new information related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date may be identified. The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the net assets acquired as of the February 28, 2023 acquisition date (in thousands):

###### Acquisition of Grand Invest Group

 On February 6, 2023, Solenis Colombia S.A.S. (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company), acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of GI Industria Peru S.A.C., Grupo Andino de Inversiones S.A.C., and Andino Servicios y Montajes Industriales S.A.C., (collectively the "Grand Invest Group"), a Peruvian chemicals distributor and service provider serving a variety of industries in Peru and the broader Latin American market. This acquisition provides opportunity for Solenis to expand further into the Peruvian market where it currently has a limited presence. Total consideration transferred at closing was $24.0 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. In addition to the consideration transferred at closing, the former owners are entitled to incremental compensation based on post- closing financial performance of Grand Invest during a two-year earnout period commencing on February 6, 2023, with an estimated range between $0 and and $12.4 million. As the sellers are required to remain employees of the Company and are required to render service to Solenis during the earnout period, any incremental consideration due to the former employee-owners will be accounted for when incurred as compensation costs.

 On September 9, 2022, Innovative Water Care Global Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Clearon Corporation, an American producer and distributor of pool treatment chemicals serving primarily the North American market. As disclosed within our September 30, 2022 financial statements, net cash conveyed at closing was $287.2 million, which includes $50 million paid into escrow

###### for contingent consideration to be earned by the sellers based on specific manufacturing volume targets during the calendar year ending December 31, 2023. Subsequent to the issuance of the September 30, 2022 financial statements but within the measurement period, Solenis determined that certain customer relationships projected to deliver current period cash flows were lost in the transition from seller to buyer which should have been known and reflected in the opening balance sheet. This unexpected customer attrition resulted in lower sales demand which has reduced Solenis' need for incremental production volumes which are otherwise required to achieve the $50 million earnout paid into escrow at closing. In addition, incremental quantitative and qualitative data points provided by employees of the acquired production facility during the measurement period resulted in a revised fair value determination of the fixed assets recorded to the opening balance sheet. In totality, these data points resulted in reductions to acquired Customer relationship intangibles, reductions to the purchase price via increases in the Contingent consideration receivable, and increases in the value of personal property at the acquired production facility. Note that the impact to the Consolidated Statement of Operations as a result of these changes in the prior year would have impacted both depreciation and amortization expense but would be immaterial to all relevant periods.

###### Generally, the Company sells products to select, pre-approved customers whose businesses may be affected by changes in economic and market conditions. 
 Note 6  Sale of Trade Receivables
 On March 21, 2022, the Company executed an extension of the existing RPA with ING Luxembourg ("ING"), which was originally executed on March 26, 2018 and amended on March 20, 2020. While no other material terms have been revised, the expiration of the RPA was amended to January 31, 2024. Additionally, on March 22, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the RPA to include Solenis Polska Sp. z.o.o. (a Polish subsidiary of the Company; "Solenis Poland") as an originator and servicer such that trade receivables generated within Poland can be included within the scope of the facility. 
 Through the Accounts Receivable Financing facilities, the Company sells eligible short-term trade receivables on the initial transfer date in exchange for consideration inclusive of cash conveyed to Solenis (referred to as the Initial Purchase Price, or "IPP") and a beneficial interest in the receivables collected by ING (referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price, or "DPP"). The Company continues to service the receivables sold in connection with the arrangement. The RPA requires Solenis to pledge its cash collection accounts for the underlying receivables to ING whereby neither the receivables sold to ING nor the future cash collections on the sold receivables are assets of Solenis post-transfer.
 Through maturity, ING purchases new receivables from Solenis on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the jurisdiction, in exchange for incremental DPP. These amounts are settled monthly against sold receivables which were previously collected. 
 The DPP is carried at fair value, which is remeasured weekly to take into account activity during the period (the Company's interest in the newly-transferred receivables and collections on previously transferred receivables attributable to the DPP), as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional discussion surrounding the fair value of the DPP.
 Receivables are sold to ING with the condition that Solenis indemnify ING in the event of non-collection. Consequently, non-collections on sold receivables could expose the Company to losses. The maximum potential loss surrounding this transaction is equal to the face amount of receivables sold. The Company has evaluated the probability of loss, concluding the risk of material losses associated with this sale is remote.
 Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold during the Successor three months ended March 31, 2023 and three months ended March 31, 2022 were less than $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold during the Successor six months ended March 31, 2023, Successor period from November 9, 2021 to March 31, 2022 and Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 were less than $0.1 million, $0.7 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.

###### As discussed within Note 1, the Acquisition and Contribution resulted in the recognition of residual Goodwill of $2.1 billion. Subsequent to the opening balance sheet date for Olympus, the Company closed five additional acquisitions, four of which were accounted for within the scope of ASC 805, resulting in the recognition of incremental goodwill. Activity related to the residual Goodwill recognized during the six months ended March 31, 2023 is specific to two current year acquisitions, as well as measurement period adjustments related to an acquisition closed during the year ended September 30, 2022. These transactions include:
 On February 28, 2023, the Company acquired the paper process chemicals assets of Kolb Distribution, Ltd., a manufacturer and distributor of paper process chemicals, surfactants and chemical intermediates. Total consideration transferred was $20 million which was ascribed to net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805.  Residual goodwill ascribed to the acquisition was $2.6 million, of which $0 is deductible for tax purposes. 
 On February 6, 2023, the Company acquired Grand Invest Group, a Peruvian chemicals distributor and service provider. Total consideration transferred was $23.3 million which was ascribed to net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805. Residual goodwill ascribed to the acquisition was $8.8 million, of which $0 is deductible for tax purposes. 
 On September 9, 2022, the company acquired Clearon Corporation, an American producer and distributor of pool treatment chemicals. Total net consideration transferred as of September 30, 2022 was $261.3 million which was ascribed to the net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805. After the September 30, 2022 financial statements were issued, but within the measurement period, management revised the purchase price allocation for Clearon as discussed within Note 4, resulting in a reduction to Goodwill of $22.1 million during the six months ended March 31, 2023. 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2023, management identified potential impairment triggering events specific to its Pools reporting unit, driven by recent customer attrition and a renegotiation of a below-market supply agreement for key raw materials. Accordingly, management determined that a quantitative impairment test should be performed specific to the Goodwill ascribed to the Pools reporting unit. Management's assessment used an income approach through which risk-adjusted cash flows were projected and discounted using market specific

###### to ensure continuity of supply in future negotiations. As a result of the change in the projected cash flows available to Solenis resulting from the agreement, management determined that the straight-line amortization method no longer best approximates the pattern of value transfer given increasing value erosion in future periods and will accelerate amortization via a reduced useful life resulting in a change in accounting estimate in accordance with ASC 250-10. Note that the change in accounting estimate resulted in incremental amortization expense within Cost of sales of $6.4 million, and $12.8 million, during the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, respectively. 

 During the Successor three and six months ended March 31, 2023, Solenis recognized an impairment charge of $4.8 million specific to the book value of certain capitalized IPR&D projects which were subsequently abandoned during the period. All remaining projects for which costs were capitalized in connection with the Acquisition and Contribution remain in-process as of March 31, 2023.

###### The fair values of Solenis' primary term debt instruments are based on estimates using quoted market prices and pricing models that take into account the present value of future cash flows as of the respective balance sheets date. The Company believes that these instruments qualify as Level 2 measurements. The carrying amounts of the remainder of Solenis' debt and finance lease obligations approximate fair value due to their primarily short-term nature. 

 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

 Successor

 In order to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, Solenis may seek offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company entered into two interest rate cap agreements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's USD and EUR term loans. The three-year interest rate cap agreement specific to the USD term loan and incremental USD term loan has a notional value of $1,389.6 million. The two-year interest rate cap agreement on the EUR term loan has a notional value of $545.0 million (500 million EUR). As a result of these agreements, the variable interest rate on the USD and EUR term loans are subject

###### to a strike rate of 5% SOFR and 4% EURIBOR, respectively. These contracts commence in June 2023 and have been designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges. 

 The Company maintains a variety of long-term supply agreements with BASF, it's legacy JV partner during the Predecessor period. Certain of these supply agreements were extended at or around the closing of the the Acquisition and Contribution, and are accounted for as embedded finance leases as of, and during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. Refer to Notes 11 and 14 for further discussion. 

 Predecessor

 During the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million. As a result of these arrangements, the Company collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.26%, 3.12%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36-month period from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022.

 For the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021 Solenis reclassified expense of $9.2 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Non operating (income) expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 While Solenis partially mitigated the market driven interest rate risk on its term debt through the use of interest rate swaps, the Company has historically experienced significant foreign exchange risk on its First Lien Euro Loans. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had First Lien Euro Loans of $899.8 million (EUR 777.2 million). To mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with these loans on a go-forward basis, management determined to pursue solutions without incurring the cost or underlying risks associated with derivative financial instruments.

 Effective April 1, 2021, the Company determined to utilize an intercompany Euro denominated note between two downstream consolidated subsidiaries to act as a hedging instrument in response to the foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's consolidated EUR net asset exposure (i.e. the "hedged item"). The intercompany note will act as a "net investment hedge" through which changes in the USD equivalent of the intercompany note will be recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) rather than through the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as is common for foreign currency denominated monetary instruments. The use of an intercompany note is permissible under ASC 815-20, Derivatives, only to the extent that the intercompany note reflects the consolidated foreign exchange risk of the consolidated company, and the entity party to the third-party debt instrument is the counterparty to the intercompany note designated as a hedging instrument. As of April 1, 2021 and through November 8, 2021, Solenis meets both of these criteria required to assume a net investment hedge.

 Each month, Solenis redesignates a specific amount of Euro denominated intercompany notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro net assets. The Company's designation is limited to the lowest value in the subset of data points among: 1) The total Euro value of the intercompany note outstanding, 2) The total Euro value of Solenis' consolidated First Lien Euro Loans, and 3) The total Euro value of Solenis' net assets in consolidated subsidiaries that utilize a Euro functional currency. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had designated EUR 777.2 million of its intercompany Euro notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate

###### the foreign currency risk associated with the Company's $816.1 million of consolidated Euro net assets (relative to total First Lien Euro Loans of EUR 777.2 million). No reclassifications of Other comprehensive income (loss) specific to the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the next 12 months. 

 During the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021, the Company deferred incremental unrealized gains on its EUR term loans of $1.1 million to Other Comprehensive Income. In connection with the settlement of its existing debt for the Olympus closing which removes the underlying hedged item critical to ensure the effectiveness of the Net Investment Hedge, the Company reclassified the $10.4 million and $1.1 million of unrealized gains deferred in the collective Predecessor periods (total of $11.5 million) to realized gains within Non operating expense (income), net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021.

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING agreed to continue serving non-US markets for a maximum capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum RPA capacity carried by MUFG was $75.0 million to serve the US market. The RPA agreement with MUFG was scheduled to expire in March of 2022. 
 In connection with the Acquisition, Solenis fully repaid its outstanding obligations to MUFG of $46.7 million, inclusive of accrued interest through November 8, 2021 of $0.1 million. The reduction of Solenis' principal obligations was recognized as a net increase to Accounts Receivable and Sold Receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of $46.6 million, while the $0.1 million of interest expense was recognized via Interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021. As of November 9, 2021, Olympus remains party to the ING RPA and will continue to sell receivables in

###### certain European markets and Canada. Various amended RPAs with ING have been executed since March 20, 2020, with a current expiration date of January 31, 2024. Refer to Note 6 for additional details.
 Initial consideration received through the Accounts Receivable Financing included a subordinated interest in transferred receivables collected, referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price. The DPP is carried at fair value and is remeasured weekly to reflect activity during the period (i.e. the Company's interest in subsequently-transferred receivables and collections on receivables previously sold to ING or MUFG) as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. The fair value of the DPP is predicated upon the underlying receivables which have been transferred to ING or MUFG. As the underlying receivables represent the Company's customers with the highest credit quality and are generally collectible within 90 days, the Company expects the fair value of the DPP to be equal to its face value.
 Receivables under the Accounts Receivable Financing are transferred to ING or MUFG daily, weekly, or monthly in accordance with the prevailing agreement for each jurisdiction. The consideration for the transfer of these receivables is incremental DPP to be settled at each settlement date, as defined in the RPAs. 
 As the receivables transferred to ING and MUFG do not have an active market for equivalent or similar assets, the Company's fair value assessment is predicated upon its own history of collection surrounding the specific customers' receivables which have been transferred. Accordingly, such inputs qualify as Level 3 inputs. Due to the high credit quality and the relatively short-term nature of the underlying receivables, fluctuations in credit quality are expected to have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the DPP.
 Note 13  Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation

 Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments

 In connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture with BASF on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a number of "take or pay" contracts (the "Supply Agreements") through which BASF will make certain materials required to service acquired BASF legacy customers available to Solenis based upon a combination of legacy BASF volumes for these materials and available manufacturing capacity. The term of these agreements is either three (the "Medium Term"), or eight years (the "Long Term"). Upon maturity, each of the Medium Term agreements will automatically extend for 12 months on a revolving basis unless either party provides 24 months notice of their intention to exit the agreement. There is no penalty for either party to exit provided the 24 month notice period is met. Upon maturity, each of the Long Term agreements will expire immediately unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Solenis and BASF.

 Given the substantial capital and working capital requirements necessary to maintain available capacity and meet Solenis' purchasing requirements, the Company is required to remit minimum monthly payments (the "Fixed Manufacturing Costs") designed to cover BASF's plant overhead costs specific to the impacted production lines. The monthly payments are fixed and determinable, based on allocations of BASF's heritage costing structure relative to expected production and volumes and vary only based upon annual changes in inflation rates observable in the public domain.

###### During the Successor six months ended March 31, 2023, Successor period ended March 31, 2022 and the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 total Fixed Manufacturing Costs incurred were $35.3 million, $29.5 million and $6.6 million respectively.

 Future minimum Fixed Manufacturing Costs as of the Successor period ended March 31, 2023 are as follows (in thousands):

**Future Minimum Commitment Payments**

2023 $ 37,640

2024 75,280

2026 75,280

2027 53,965

Thereafter 78,261

Total $ 395,706

###### Due to the nature of Solenis' business, the Company is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety. The total reserves for environmental remediation reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. 

 Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites. 

 In connection with the JV, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis. During the diligence process related to the acquisition, Solenis performed diligence related to potential environmental or other contingent liabilities. As no probable or estimable exposure existed at the acquisition date, Solenis is not indemnified with

##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]                        

###### respect to any environmental or other contingent matters. As of both the Successor period ended March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company does not have material contingent obligations which are both probable and estimable related to these production facilities, transferred employees, or other real property acquired from BASF. 

 As of both the Successor periods ended March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company has recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, related to two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. These reserves are included as part of other non-current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Given the limited time frame over which remediation activities are expected to be performed, the Company has not discounted any projected future cash outflows in determining these reserves as of March 31, 2023.

 Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million relates to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million relates to management's best estimate for potential exposure related to ground contamination at the Company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a potential Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management's best estimate of total expenses to be incurred, made with the assistance of a third-party specialist. 

 Indemnification assets associated with environmental remediation claims are recorded on the Successor Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of Other assets in the amount of $1.0 million as of both March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. 

 Other Legal Proceedings

 In addition to the matters described above, there are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings that are pending or threatened. Such actions seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. 

 The Company has accrued for legal reserves of $3.4 million and $2.8 million as of Successor period ended March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. While Solenis cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, the Company believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions.

 During the predecessor and successor periods, the income tax benefit was primarily attributable to the pre-tax loss at varying statutory rates, the movement of previously established valuation allowances, and adjustments related to the closing of the Transaction.

###### Note 16  Hyperinflationary Economies
 On May 16, 2018 and on March 16, 2022, the International Practices Task Force categorized Argentina and Turkey, respectively, as countries with highly-inflationary economies. Accounting Standards Codification 830, Foreign Currency Matters, requires entities domiciled in these jurisdictions to change their functional currency to the reporting currency of its parent entity on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter after this determination has been made. 
 The Company consolidates wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkey for which the functional currency of these entities has historically matched their respective local currencies. Solenis Argentina, S.A. ("Solenis Argentina") and Solenis Turkey Kimya Limited Sirketi ("Solenis Turkey") sell direct to end customers exclusively in their domestic markets. The Company does not have manufacturing facilities in either subsidiary and accordingly, the majority of its net assets are current to support local distribution activities. Revenues specific to Solenis Argentina and Solenis Turkey are presented below in the aggregate during periods in which local economies were deemed hyperinflationary (in thousands):

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Management of Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.

**_Opinion_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.
and its subsidiaries (Successor) (the "Company"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income
(loss), of partner's equity and of cash flows for the period from November 9, 2021 to September 30, 2022,
including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements").

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for the period from November 9, 2021 to September 30, 2022 in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**_Basis for Opinion_**

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America (US GAAS). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors'
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are
required to be independent of the Company and to meet our other ethical responsibilities, in accordance
with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**_Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and
fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether
due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or
events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern for one year after the date the financial statements are available to be issued.

**_Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that
includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance
and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect
a material misstatement when it exists.

-----

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from
error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually
or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial
statements.

In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we:

###### ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.
 ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,
whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.

###### ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is
expressed.

###### ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the
consolidated financial statements.

###### ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate,
that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a
reasonable period of time.

We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related
matters that we identified during the audit.

To the Management of Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Solenis UK International Limited
and its subsidiaries (Predecessor) (the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;
this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation
and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

**_Auditors’ Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company's
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Note 1  Business Background

 General Description of the Business

 Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. (hereafter "Olympus" or "the Company"), doing business as "Solenis" from November 9, 2021, is an exempted limited partnership registered and domiciled under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Olympus and several other holding companies and partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC ("Platinum"), all of which are organized under Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P, a Cayman exempted limited partnership whose partners are certain investment vehicles advised by Platinum and members of the Solenis management team.

 The Company was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of consummating the purchase of the consolidated operations of Solenis UK International Limited (the "Acquisition" or the "Transaction"). The Solenis business was formerly owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R"), BASF SE, and management. The Company also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of receiving the contribution of Innovative Water Global Corporation (doing business as "Sigura", i.e. the "Contribution"). The Sigura business was formerly 100% owned by affiliates of Platinum and was contributed to Olympus immediately subsequent to the Acquisition on November 9, 2021 and both qualified and were accounted for as Business Combinations under ASC 805.

 Olympus was formed under a group of holding companies. Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings II, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership. Olympus Water Holdings II L.P. holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings III, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership. Olympus Water Holdings III holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus. These holding companies and partnerships are collectively referred to as the "Holding Companies". The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above.

 The Company acquired the consolidated operations of Solenis UK International Limited through a series of acquisition steps defined as the "Alternative Transaction Structure" (the "ATS") in the Securities Purchase Agreement ("SPA") effective November 9, 2021. The ATS resulted in the following legal ownership structure:

 Olympus owns 100% of the shares of Olympus Water US Holding Corporation domiciled in the United States of America (the "US"), and 100% of the shares of Olympus Water UK Holding Limited domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the "UK");

 Olympus Water US Holding Corporation owns 100% of the equity interest of Solenis Holdings LLC domiciled in the US, and all of its wholly-owned direct subsidiaries;

 Olympus Water UK Holdings Limited owns 100% of the shares (membership interest) of:
 • Olympus Water Canada Acquisition ULC which was formed for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the equity interest in Solenis Canada ULC;
 • Olympus Water France Acquisition SaS which was formed for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis France;
 • Olympus Water Germany Acquisition GmbH which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the membership interest of Solenis Germany Administrative GmbH and all of its wholly-owned direct and


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### indirect subsidiaries, as well as, 100% of the Limited Partner interest in Solenis Germany GmbH & Co KG and all of its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries;
 • Olympus Water Italy Acquisition S.r.l which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis Italia Holdings S.r.l and all of it's wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries;
 • Olympus Water Sweden Acquisition AB which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis Sweden Holdings AB and all of it's wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries;
 • Olympus Water Spain Acquisition S.L. which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis Hispania S.A. and all of its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries;
 • Olympus Water Dutch Acquisition B.V. which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the members interest in Solenis Holdings I Cooperatief U.A. and all its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, as well, as 100% of the member interest of Solenis Holdings II Cooperatief and all of its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, and;
 • Solenis UK Industries Limited and all of its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries

 Upon the execution of the acquisition steps, Platinum acquired all of the capital stock and equity interests of the entities comprising the legacy Solenis operations from Solenis UK Holdings Limited. Economic control and legal ownership of the Solenis UK Holdings Limited and Solenis UK International Limited legal entities were retained by CD&R and had no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents prior to the Acquisition.

 Immediately following the Acquisition, the Contribution which included all of Sigura's direct and indirect subsidiaries was contributed to Olympus Water Holdings I, LP, and ultimately to Olympus Water US Holding Corporation by affiliates of Platinum Equity. Accordingly, the conclusion of the Acquisition and Contribution results in the consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses (under the Solenis umbrella) from November 9, 2021 within these financial statements as presented under the "Successor" periods.

 Prior to the formation of the Company, the business existed under the "Predecessor" entity known as Solenis UK International Limited (the "Legacy Topco") and was domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Legacy Topco was formed on August 31, 2018 for the specific purpose of consummating a Joint Venture (the "Joint Venture", "JV", or "JVFA") between BASF SE ("BASF") a German-based chemical manufacturer and distributor, and the Solenis business, which was 97% owned by CD&R and 3% owned by management immediately prior to the JV. The Predecessor entity has financial statements as of and for periods prior to the Acquisition. 

 The purchase price for the Acquisition was funded by (i) an equity contribution of $1.96 billion into the Holding Companies by entities affiliated with Platinum, (ii) an equity contribution of $24.8 million by certain members of management, (iii) gross proceeds from borrowings under Term Loan facilities of $1.69 billion, and (iv) gross proceeds from borrowings under the secured and unsecured bonds of $2.10 billion. Olympus Water US Holding Corporation is the legal borrower under the Secured and Unsecured Bonds and related Term Loan facilities. The Bonds and Term Loan facilities are fully described in Note 12.

 Acquisition of Solenis and Contribution of Sigura

 On November 9, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the Solenis business pursuant to the terms of the SPA, dated July 3, 2021, between CD&R Seahawk Holdings, L.P. BASF Nederland B.V., and Solenis UK International Limited (the “Agreement”). The estimated purchase price was based on an enterprise value of $5.25 billion, less certain adjustments made pursuant to the Agreement, including retained finance leases, pension and other liabilities, tax adjustments and other fees, which includes the repayment of the Solenis Existing Indebtedness (other than the ING Receivables Purchasing agreement, which will remain in place following the consummation of the Acquisition), including any breakage fees associated therewith, at closing which resulted in


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### a net cash purchase price of $5.1 billion exclusive of any cash acquired. The purchase price was subject to post- closing adjustments for (i) differences between estimated and actual Net Working Capital at closing, (ii) differences between estimated and actual Net Indebtedness at closing and (iii) differences between the estimated and actual unfunded pension liabilities for certain pension obligations that the Company assumed. 

 Immediately following the acquisition of Solenis, the Contribution was effectuated for a value of $500.0 million. The contribution was made from Platinum Equity Fund IV ("Fund IV"; which had owned 100% of the Sigura business) to Platinum Equity Fund V ("Fund V"). In consideration of the Contribution, Fund IV obtained a minority equity position in the combined business controlled by Fund V (which controls Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.).

 The Acquisition and Contribution were both separately determined to represent an accounting change of control and are accounted for as business combinations under ASC 805 using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

 The following table summarizes the fair values of the net assets acquired as of the November 9, 2021 Acquisition and Contribution dates ($ in thousands):

**Purchase Price Allocation - November 9, 2021**

Cash $ 192,418

Current assets 1,202,340

Property, plant & equipment 1,052,676

Intangible assets 2,690,880
Deferred tax assets 119,193

Goodwill 2,114,441

Restricted cash 1,791

Other assets 133,646

Total assets 7,507,385

Current liabilities 719,129

Deferred taxes 411,381

Employee benefit liabilities 100,575

Short term and long-term debt assumed 483,715

Other liabilities 226,937

Total liabilities 1,941,737

Net assets acquired 5,565,648

Less: cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired via the acquisition and contribution 194,209

Less: Non-cash consideration via contribution 500,000

Total net cash conveyed at closing $ 4,871,439

###### The determination of Goodwill was recognized for the Acquisition and Contribution as the excess of the purchase price over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired for purposes of creating a standalone entity, which cannot be individually identified and separately recognized.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### The fair values of intangible assets were estimated using an income approach, either the excess earnings method (customer relationships) or the relief from royalty method (technology, trademark and trade name, and process know how), multi-period excess earnings method (in process research and development), and with and without method (supply agreements). Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. Under the multi- period excess earnings method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its projected useful life. Under the with and without method, fair value is measured by estimating future earnings associated with the supply agreement over its projected useful life and comparing that value to an estimate of future earnings without the supply agreement. These intangible assets collectively enable us to manufacture and develop new products to meet the evolving business needs as well as competitively produce our existing products.

 The fair value of real properties acquired was based on the consideration of their highest and best use in the market. The fair values of property, plant, and equipment, other than real properties, were based on the consideration that unless otherwise identified, they will continue to be used “as is” and as part of the ongoing business. In contemplation of the in-use premise and the nature of the assets, the fair value was developed primarily using a cost approach. The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessing factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition.

 In connection with the Acquisition, the Company incurred expenses of $47.9 million during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. These expenses are reflected in Acquisition and transaction related expenses within Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the Olympus entities incurred $75.0 million of pre-deal transaction expenses prior to September 30, 2021 which are reflected within beginning accumulated deficit. In addition to deal-related transaction costs which were expensed as incurred, the Company also incurred debt financing costs of $165.6 million and $4.2 million of original issue discount which were capitalized at closing and will be amortized on an effective interest method basis over the term of the related debt instruments.

 In anticipation of the closing of the Acquisition, the Solenis business extinguished obligations of $65.6 million as part of its pre-closing settlements which included $46.7 million to settle remaining balances due under the MUFG Accounts Receivable Financing Facility, $13.7 million related to interest-rate swaps, and $5.2 million related to foreign exchange derivatives. Additionally, Solenis incurred Acquisition related expenses of $57.7 million and time and performance related share-based incentive compensation of $17.8 million which is inclusive of employer related taxes. These costs are reflected in the Predecessor period within Total operating expenses and Non operating income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 As of September 30, 2022, the measurement period with respect to the Acquisition and Contribution has been closed.

 Basis of Presentation

 Olympus' consolidated financial statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Olympus, including all Holding Companies. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

 The financial statements have been presented on a comparative basis. For periods prior to the Acquisition, the Company is referred to as the Predecessor where as periods subsequent to the Acquisition are referred to as the Successor. Due to the Acquisition and the application of "push-down accounting", different bases of accounting

Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, can have a significant effect on operations. While Solenis maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Solenis could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to environmental remediation or other matters.

 Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies

 Use of Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties

 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include impairment of long- lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computation of income tax provision, and calculation of reserves, including those for environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.

 Russia and Ukraine Conflict

 Geopolitical events such as the recent conflict between Russia, Ukraine and members of the "North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or "NATO" could have significant effects on the business which include restrictions on sales and distribution activities, supply chain disruptions, and limitation on the Company's ability to repatriate funds. Solenis conducts operations in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded. Should the Company fail to comply knowingly or unknowingly with sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations, Solenis could be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of licenses, or a cessation of operations, as well as damage to the Company's image and reputation. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to quickly and completely adapt it's business model to changes that could result from these recent events, and any such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### As of September 30, 2022 and through the date these financial statements were available to be issued, the conflict has not materially impacted the Company's consolidated operations. Total Net sales of the Company's entities in Russia represent 2.6%, 2.0%, 2.4%, and 2.2%, of the Company's consolidated Net sales during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, and the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, respectively. Total assets and Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's entities in Russia represented 3.0% and 11.9%, and 2.0% and 5.0% of the Company's consolidated total assets and Cash and cash equivalents as of the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, and as of the Predecessor period ended September 30, 2021, respectively.

 Principles of Consolidation and Combination

 Solenis' Consolidated Financial Statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Solenis, including all Holding Companies for both the Predecessor and Successor periods as defined.

 Investments in companies in which Solenis, directly or indirectly, owns up to 50% of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result, Solenis’ share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Solenis' share of these companies’ shareholders’ equity is included in Investments in equity affiliates in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 Successor

 The Company was formed on June 29, 2021. The results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the period from June 29, 2021 until November 8, 2021 (period prior to the Acquisition date) consists of acquisition and start-up costs related to the Acquisition and Contribution. On November 9, 2021, the Company consummated the acquisition of the historical Solenis UK International Limited business and received the contributed legacy Sigura business from other Platinum affiliates. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Solenis as of September 30, 2022 and related consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the period through September 30, 2022 and consolidated statements of cash flows and of changes in partners’ equity for the period through September 30, 2022 are labeled as “Successor.” The Successor financial statements as of September 30, 2022 and for the period through September 30, 2022 reflect acquisition accounting and other transaction related adjustments resulting from the Acquisition and Contribution, as well as results of the consolidated legacy Solenis and legacy Sigura operations effective as of November 9, 2021.

 Predecessor

 The accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Solenis UK International Limited as of September 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income and cash flows for the period from October, 1, 2021 through November 8, 2021 and the years ended September 30, 2021, September 30, 2020, include transactions directly attributable to the closing of the Acquisition and the repayment of certain financial obligations extinguished prior to closing and are labeled as “Predecessor”. As a result of the application of acquisition accounting as of the closing date of the Acquisition, the financial statements for the Successor period and the Predecessor periods are presented on a different basis, and are therefore not comparable. The visible

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### "black-line" within these face financial statements and accompanying footnotes presents the demarcation of these different bases of presentation.

 During the Predecessor periods, standalone financial statements were historically prepared for Solenis UK International Limited. The Predecessor financial statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities that are considered to comprise the Solenis UK International business.

 Foreign Currency Translation

 For both the Predecessor and Successor periods, the reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive loss.

 In circumstances where the economy in which one of the Company's subsidiaries operates is determined to be highly inflationary, the functional currency for the entity is changed to the U.S. dollar on a prospective basis. Refer to Note 23 for discussion surrounding the Company's operations in economies which have been determined to be highly inflationary.

 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

 Cash and cash equivalents represent cash deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash which has a legal restriction regarding its use or withdrawal is classified as Restricted cash and is classified as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The below table reconciles Cash and cash equivalents to Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (amounts in thousands):

**As of September 30,**

**2022** **2021**

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company's best estimate of losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. Accounts receivable are written down or off when a portion or all of such account receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense is recorded as a component of Selling, general and administration expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Additionally, Solenis maintains various global credit insurance policies which serve to partially indemnify the Company from the risk of loss related to uncollectible trade receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on a gross basis, independent of any considerations regarding potential indemnification assets resulting from successfully submitted claims under the Company's credit insurance policies. This indemnification asset is recorded as a component of Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related benefit available to the Company for successfully submitted claims is recorded as a contra-expense as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Inventories, net

 Inventory of the Successor acquired in the Acquisition and Contribution was recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Inventories on hand purchased subsequent to the Acquisition are valued the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method. Inventories deemed to have costs greater than their respective market values are reduced to net realizable value as a loss in the period recognized. Inventories on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory based on anticipated demand and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.

 Property, Plant and Equipment

 Property, plant and equipment of the Successor acquired via the Acquisition and Contribution was recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent additions to property, plant & equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives by asset class are summarized below for both the Successor and Predecessor period:

Buildings and building improvements 5 to 30 years
Machinery and equipment 2 to 15 years
Software 2 to 5 years

###### The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines, and technological obsolescence.

 Recorded values of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows (assets held for use) or net realizable value (assets held for sale). There were no impairment charges for property, plant & equipment during the Successor period or either of the Predecessor periods.

 Depreciation expense is presented as a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, depending upon the use of the underlying asset.

###### Revenue Recognition

 For the Successor period ending September 30, 2022, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2021 through November 8, 2021 and the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2021, revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 606. For the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2020, revenues were recognized in accordance with ASC 605. As the Company did not record an adjustment through retained earnings in transition, there are no quantifiable variances in revenue recognition between standards or periods.

 Refer to Note 3 for a detailed discussion of the Company's contracts, performance obligations, and revenue recognition patterns.

 Expense Recognition

 Cost of sales includes material and production costs, as well as the costs of inbound and outbound freight, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, internal transfers, and all other distribution network costs. Selling, general and administrative expense includes sales and marketing costs, advertising, customer support, environmental remediation and administrative costs.

 The Company does not sell products with warranties. Accordingly, there are no liabilities for product warranties.

 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are reported as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses were $17.3 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, $0.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million for the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

 Research and Development

 Research and development costs incurred during the normal course of business are expensed as incurred. In- process research development projects acquired in a business combination are recorded as intangible assets at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent costs related to acquire in-process research and development assets are expensed as incurred.

 Litigation

 The Company accrues for liabilities related to litigation matters when available information indicates that the liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

 Income Taxes

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 Where the Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company provides for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings.


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Additionally, the Company accrues for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The current portion of unrecognized tax benefits is included within Trade and other payables and the long-term portion is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Value Added Taxes ("VAT")

 Solenis is subject to VAT in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company’s collective global VAT positions do not have a right of offset and are netted by jurisdiction for financial statement presentation purposes. The Company provides for gross asset, and gross liability positions within Prepaid expenses and other assets, and within Accrued expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company presents the net change in its global VAT positions within Other assets and liabilities.

 Accounting for Business Combinations

 The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date fair values. As applicable, any excess purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recorded as Goodwill.

 The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, involves an assessment of the factors including, but not limited to the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and an appropriate discount rate at the closing date of an acquisition. For non-observable market values, the Company determines fair value using acceptable valuation principles.

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets

 In accordance with ASC 350, impairment tests are performed for goodwill and in-process research and development assets annually as of July 1 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level.

 The Company assigns goodwill to individual reporting units at the date of acquisition based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination. This assessment is based solely on the pre-acquisition expectation of revenue and free cash flow by reporting unit.

 When conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit (or asset, specific to any in-process research and development assets) is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.

 When determined necessary under the qualitative assessment, Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The latter is determined using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for goodwill are employed and include, but are not limited to, projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors and the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### The Successor holds certain intangible in process research and development assets classified as indefinite until the abandonment or completion of the associated research and development efforts. If abandoned, these assets will be impaired. If the activities are completed, the useful life of the assets will be determined and amortized prospectively. 

 Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives and asset classes are as follows for the Successor Period and Predecessor Period, respectively:

**_Successor_**
Customer relationships 12 to 15 years
Trademarks and trade names 10 to 15 years
Proprietary process know how 10 to 15 years
Intellectual property 10 years
Supply and reverse supply agreements 3 to 8 years

**_Predecessor_**
Customer relationships 5 to 20 years
Trademarks and trade names 3 to 20 years
Proprietary process know how 8 to 15 years
Intellectual property 3 to 15 years
Supply and reverse supply agreements 3 to 8 years
Other intangibles 3 years

###### The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 The carrying value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, to be held and used is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value and is based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies including present value techniques.

 Commitments, Contingencies and Environmental Costs

 Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.

 Accruals for environmental remediation are recognized when it is probable, when a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded at estimated present values based on experience, assessments and current technology, without regard to any third-party recoveries (which are recorded as assets) and are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and remediation efforts advance.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits

 The Company has certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations for current and former employees of non-US subsidiaries.

 Defined benefit plans specify an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. These benefits are then discounted to determine the present value of the obligations and are then adjusted for the impact of any unamortized prior service costs. The net obligation is then determined with reference to the fair value of the plan assets (if any). The discount rate used to determine the present value of existing obligations is typically the yield on bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have maturity dates approximating the term of the obligations.

 Share-based Compensation

 The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for all options and other arrangements within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718. Awards are classified as equity if such options are settled in shares and classified as liabilities if they are settled in cash. Share-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized using the "straight-line attribution method" over the employee’s requisite service period for service awards and on a tranche-by-tranche basis for awards with performance or market driven vesting conditions. Awards classified as liabilities are measured for fair value at each reporting date on a "mark to market" basis, with any changes to fair value recognized currently in earnings based on the extent of the requisite service period elapsed. The fair value of awards classified as liabilities are presented as a component of Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 For additional information on the Company`s share-based compensation arrangements, refer to Note 17.

 Fair Value Measurements

 U.S. GAAP defines a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 The following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value for assets and liabilities:

 Level 1- Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

 Level 2- Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs);

 Level 3- Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities which are valued based on management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability; and

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Net Asset Value ("NAV")- The Company invests in funds which are not quoted on an active market. These funds are valued based on the underlying fair value of the funds investments less the funds liabilities or net asset value.

 Derivatives

 The Company is exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, changes in commodity prices and credit risk. In the Predecessor periods, the Company utilized interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuating interest rates on its long term debt and net investment hedging to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro denominated net assets and third-party debt. Refer to specific discussion of these arrangements within Note 14. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as part of Cash Flows from Operations in the Predecessor period only.

 Sale of Accounts Receivable

 The Company accounts for sales of trade receivables when control is relinquished. Whether control has been relinquished requires among other considerations, an evaluation of the relevant legal constructs and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the receivables transferred. Assets obtained and liabilities incurred in connection with the transfers reported as sales are initially recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

 Accounts receivable sold are deemed transferred to a counterparty in accordance with the prevailing purchase agreement applicable to the relevant jurisdiction. In situations where cash is immediately received from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, such cash is classified as cash received from operating activities. In situations where cash is not received immediately from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, the transfer is deemed to represent a non-cash investing activity whereby the receivable is sold for a subordinated interest in future cash collections. Ultimate collections of cash on the subordinated interest in future cash collections are treated as cash flows from investing activities.

 Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

 In February 2016, the FASB announced new lease accounting guidance in ASU 2016-02, "Leases" ("ASC 842"). Under the new guidance, lessees are required to measure and capitalize future payment obligations greater than one year as a lease liability, while recognizing the offsetting ability to use, or control a specified leased asset during the lease term as a right-of-use ("ROU") asset. The adoption timeline of the new standard has been amended and deferred though the current required adoption date for private issuers is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Given the significant investment in new controls, procedures and documentation requirements, the Company had previously planned to meet an earlier adoption timeline prior to the one-year deferral noted in ASU 2020-05 and as such, adopted ASC 842 on October 1, 2020 utilizing a modified retrospective approach and elected the package of practical expedients at the transition date.

 The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in a material change to the Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the gross-up of operating lease liabilities and the related ROU assets, though the other related face statements are not significantly impacted. The adoption of ASC 842 required adjustments to record the initial lease liabilities and ROU assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Despite the use of the modified retrospective approach, the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was deemed to be immaterial especially as leases previously recognized as capital leases under ASC 840 are recognized as finance leases in transition and as such, no changes were recorded to the Company's Accumulated deficit as of October 1, 2020.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### On October 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", using the modified retrospective adoption method. This standard attempts to align the revenue recognition frameworks put forth by the FASB and IASB and eliminate some of the industry specific guidance that has led to revenue recognition discrepancies in practice for economically similar transactions. In substance, the standard speaks to a principles driven approach through which an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASC 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance previously codified under ASC 605, though the principles described within ASC 605 remain largely unchanged in the revised standard. The adoption of the standard results in incremental disclosure requirements regarding the disaggregation of revenue, discussion of the allocation of consideration to the Company's performance obligations and the pattern of recognition associated with those obligations.

 Despite the transition, no adjustments to retained earnings on a cumulative basis or other adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets were deemed necessary. In general, there is no quantitative impact associated with the Company's adoption of the standard given the limited complexity of the Company's business model. Using the practical expedients provided for under the modified retrospective adoption method, ASC 606 was applied through the specific lens of the Company's existing contracts as of October 1, 2020, and those which were entered into subsequent to the adoption date. Comparative financial information has not been evaluated and continues to be presented under ASC 605. Refer to Note 3 for discussion.

 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, "Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement". The update removed the disclosure requirements from Topic 820 for the valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements. Adoption of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of the update. Retrospective application is required upon adoption. Solenis adopted the standard during the year ended September 30, 2021.

 Announced Accounting Standards

 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The guidance requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, but early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact this standard would have on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to the Company's processes around the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables.

 In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-07, "Compensation - Stock Compensation - Determining the Current Price of an Underlying Share". The guidance allows a nonpublic entity to determine the current price input of equity-classified share-based awards issued to both employees and non-employees using the reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method. The guidance is effective prospectively for all qualifying awards granted or modified during fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

 In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-09, "Discount Rate for Lessees That Are Not Public Business Entities". Topic 842 currently provides lessees that are not public business entities with a practical expedient that allows them to elect, as an accounting policy, to use a risk free rate as the discount rate for all leases. The amendments in this Update allow those lessees to make the risk-free rate election by class of underlying asset, rather than at the entity-wide level. An entity that makes the risk-free rate election is required to disclose which


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### asset classes it has elected to apply a risk-free rate. The amendments require that when the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable for any individual lease, the lessee use that rate (rather than a risk free rate or an incremental borrowing rate), regardless of whether it has made the risk-free rate election. For entities that have adopted Topic 842 as of November 11, 2021, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

 In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, "Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations". The purpose of this ASU is to provide transparency around supplier related financing given the lack of current explicit disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard.

 Note 3  Revenue Recognition

 Solenis provides specialty chemical solutions designed to help improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect existing assets, and mitigate environmental impact. The Company has a broad product portfolio across its three segments with a large customer and end-market footprint. In addition to its product portfolio, Solenis also provides support services via its service engineers and application experts and provides access to chemical feed equipment as needed.

 The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are fulfilled which is when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Solenis allocates the overall contractual consideration to each performance obligation using stand-alone selling prices when available, or will allocate consideration in the absence of stand-alone selling prices by estimating the cost of fulfilling a performance obligation and applying a markup based upon market-participant expectations. Based on the nature of the Company's operations and the structure of its customer contracts, performance obligations are typically fulfilled commensurate with the delivery of product.

 Arrangements with customers vary based upon customer needs and requirements and as such, long-term written contracts that provide for a measurable transaction price at commencement are an exception. In certain instances, terms and conditions between the Company and its customers are reflected in master service agreements ("MSAs"). When relevant, Solenis considers MSAs to provide customers with options to purchase goods and services through which no material rights are conveyed. Accordingly, the Company typically considers accepted purchase orders to represent customer contracts through which legal rights and obligations are formalized and a transaction price becomes measurable. In normal course, Solenis invoices the customer when title to and risk of loss of the product have been transferred. Payment terms vary by geography but are typically between 30 and 90 days subsequent to the fulfillment of a product specific performance obligation. Given the limited duration of payment terms, the Company does not have significant financing components.

 Solenis' limited number of existing long-term contracts, reliance on accepted purchase orders to determine transaction price, and terms and conditions which require payment upon the fulfillment of product specific performance obligations, limits the potential for material contract assets and liabilities. As of the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and the Predecessor period ended September 30, 2021 the Company has recorded contract assets and liabilities of $0.

 Solenis elected the practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, as such amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are recognized within Net sales, and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as Cost of sales. Amount billed for sales and use taxes, value added taxes and other


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### transactions taxes are presented on a net basis and excluded from the presentation of Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 The nature of the Company’s business gives rise to variable consideration, including discounts, customer rebates and rights of return on product sales that decrease the transaction price and reduces revenue. These amounts are estimated based upon the most likely amount of consideration to which the customer will be entitled. All estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and the Company’s best judgment at the time to the extent it is probable, that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. All estimates for variable consideration are reassessed periodically.

 Based on the structure of compensation arrangements with sales employees and the period of performance for contracts being less than one year, costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are expensed as incurred.

###### Acquisition of SCL GmbH ("SCL")

 On January 18, 2022, Solenis Germany GmbH & Co. KG (a German distributor and consolidated subsidiary of the Company) completed the purchase of 100% of the outstanding shares of SCL for an enterprise value of 19.8M EUR subject to closing adjustments for working capital and net indebtedness. Prior to the transaction, SCL sold DMA3 (a raw material critical to polyacrylamide production) to a limited number of customers which included Solenis. In addition to retaining other third party customer relationships, Solenis plans to utilize the additional DMA3 production capacity as an insourcing synergy to further expand into the polyacrylamide market. Despite SCL’s prior relationship as a Solenis vendor, there were no outstanding payables or receivables due between the parties at closing. In addition to the purchase price conveyed in cash, the Company has recorded a payable at closing representing a purchase price adjustment due to the sellers of $0.1 million and capitalized total transaction costs of $1.0 million to facilitate the acquisition.

 SCL controls no inventory, has no legal ownership of any tangible assets or intellectual property and has no employees other than its owners. However, SCL is party to a supply agreement through which it obtains access to DMA3 at cost for which the underlying contract represents an intangible and right-of-use asset. In accordance

###### Conversion of Nanjing Option to Long-Term Supply Agreement

 On April 30, 2021, Solenis Shanghai Chemicals Company Limited (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, i.e. "Solenis Shanghai") and BASF Specialty Chemicals Nanjing Company Limited ("BASF Nanjing") agreed to convert the Company's $59.9 million deposit with BASF to a long-term supply agreement (the "LTSA"). The LTSA will provide Solenis Shanghai with an uninterrupted, eight year supply of finished goods required to serve former BASF customers acquired via Solenis' acquisition of the BASF Paper and Water business in January 2019. The $59.9 million deposit was originally conveyed via Solenis Holdings Top I B.V. (a consolidated Dutch subsidiary of Solenis) to BASF Nederland B.V. ("BASF NL") in January 2019, representing the estimated residual fair value of BASF Nanjing's manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China. The deposit was conveyed with the intention between the parties of transferring asset titles and operating permits from BASF to Solenis on, or prior to, January 31, 2022, upon which the existing three-year supply agreement between BASF Nanjing and Solenis Shanghai is scheduled to expire. The deposit was originally conveyed while the parties sought to perfect their intentions of transferring legal ownership on the basis that three years would be sufficient to achieve their original intentions. Despite the intent of both parties, the possibility of permit transfer appears to be remote and as such, the parties agreed to utilize the option consideration to create a new eight year supply agreement that will supersede the existing three year agreement. In consideration of the new LTSA, BASF NL returned the $59.9 million deposit to Solenis Holding Top I B.V. who in-turn provided funds to Solenis Shanghai such that funds could be conveyed locally to BASF Nanjing in China. In addition to $59.9 million of the initial deposit, Solenis Shanghai conveyed an incremental $5.0 million of cash representing embedded realized foreign exchange losses from the initial transaction and local transfer taxes. As of October 1, 2021 and in consideration of the cash paid by Solenis Shanghai, the LTSA is effective and a corresponding reclassification from Acquisition-related deposits to an embedded lease right-of-use asset, and an intangible asset (amortizable over the term of the eight-year agreement) was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As such and on a recurring basis, Solenis performs an analysis of its bad debt positions to determine potential indemnification under these policies. For the Successor period as of September 30, 2022 and Predecessor Period as of September 30, 2021, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, reflected within Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, Solenis recorded benefits of $0.9 million, less than $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.7 million respectively, as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Note 6  Sale of Trade Receivables

 On March 26, 2018, the Company sold certain accounts receivable under the terms of a Receivables Purchase Agreement ("RPA" or "Accounts Receivable Financing") with ING Luxembourg ("ING"). The RPA carried a maximum capacity of $120.0 million and was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. 

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING will continue to service non-US markets with a maximum funding capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum funding capacity carried by MUFG to serve the US market is $75 million.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### In connection with the Acquisition, Solenis fully repaid its outstanding obligations to MUFG of $46.7 million, inclusive of accrued interest through November 8, 2021 of $0.1 million. The reduction of Solenis' principal obligations was recognized as a net increase to Accounts Receivable and Sold Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $46.6 million, while the $0.1 million of interest expense was recognized via Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021. As of November 9, 2021, Olympus remains party to the ING RPA and will continue to sell receivables in certain European markets and Canada.

 On March 21, 2022, the Company executed an extension of the existing RPA with ING. While no other material terms have been revised, the expiration of the RPA was amended to January 31, 2024.

 Through the Accounts Receivable Financing facilities, the Company sells eligible short-term trade receivables on the initial transfer date in exchange for consideration inclusive of cash conveyed to Solenis (referred to as the Initial Purchase Price, or "IPP") and a beneficial interest in the receivables collected by ING (referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price, or "DPP"). The Company continues to service the receivables sold in connection with the arrangement. The RPA requires Solenis to pledge its cash collection accounts for the underlying receivables to ING whereby neither the receivables sold to ING nor the future cash collections on the sold receivables are assets of Solenis post-transfer.

 Through maturity, ING purchases new receivables from Solenis on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the jurisdiction, in exchange for incremental DPP. These amounts are settled monthly against sold receivables which were previously collected.

 The DPP is carried at fair value, which is remeasured weekly to take into account activity during the period (the Company's interest in the newly-transferred receivables and collections on previously transferred receivables attributable to the DPP), as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. Refer to Note 14 for additional discussion surrounding the fair value of the DPP.

 Receivables are sold to ING with the condition that Solenis indemnify ING in the event of non-collection. Consequently, non-collections on sold receivables could expose the Company to losses. The maximum potential loss surrounding this transaction is equal to the face amount of receivables sold. The Company has evaluated the probability of loss, concluding the risk of material losses associated with this sale is remote. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 were $0.7 million, while losses were less than $0.1 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million during the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, and for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

###### Successor:

 As discussed within Note 1, the Acquisition and Contribution resulted in the recognition of residual Goodwill of $2.1 billion. Subsequent to the opening balance sheet date for Olympus, the Company closed three additional acquisitions, two of which were accounted for within the scope of ASC 805, resulting in the recognition of incremental goodwill. These transactions include:

 On September 9, 2022, the company acquired Clearon Corporation, an American producer and distributor of pool treatment chemicals. Total net consideration transferred was $261.3 million which was ascribed to the net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805. Residual goodwill ascribed to this acquisition was $85.1 million, of which $0 is deductible for tax purposes.

 Additionally, on May 6, 2022, the Company acquired Neu Kimya, a Turkish producer and distributor of water treatment chemicals primarily serving Oil and Gas customers in Turkey and throughout the Middle East. Total net consideration transferred was $25.6 million which was ascribed to the net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805. Residual goodwill ascribed to this acquisition was $5.8 million, of which of which $0 is deductible for tax purposes.

 Predecessor:

 During the year ended September 30, 2021, Solenis deconsolidated the net assets of Solenis Trinidad and Tobago Limited ("Solenis Trinidad") resulting from a loss of control in anticipation of a full liquidation of the net assets of the entity. As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recognized a loss of $18.0 million reflected within Non-operating (income) expense, equal to the difference between the fair value of Solenis' residual non- controlling interest and the previously consolidated net assets of Solenis Trinidad. As a component of the overall loss recorded, Solenis wrote-off $12.8 million of Goodwill. Refer to Note 24 for additional details.

###### Note 11 Leases

 The Company leases office and lab spaces, warehouses, fleet vehicles, IT equipment and certain equipment for use in plant locations. Solenis' lease portfolio primarily includes non-cancellable agreements which contain automatic extensions, escalating or inflation-linked adjustments to base rental payments, implied or explicit references to non-lease components, and lessor incentives where relevant particularly with respect to large office locations in the United States and Europe. As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted ASC 842 as of October 1, 2020 which requires the capitalization of all fixed future payment obligations greater than one year as lease liabilities, while recognizing the offsetting ability to use or control a specified asset during the lease term as an


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### ROU asset. Through September 30, 2020, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, which required only the capitalization of capital (now known as "finance") leases. Under ASC 840, assets controlled under capital leases agreements were reflected within Property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while expenses incurred were recognized as either Depreciation expense or Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Dissimilar to finance leases, operating leases were not previously recognized as obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets though expenses incurred were reflected in either Cost of sales, or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the cost incurred.

 In adopting ASC 842, the Company elected the package of practical expedients in transition which allow primarily for prior conclusions under ASC 840 such as whether non-cancellable agreements contain leases and whether the classification of a given lease is either operating or finance to be carried forward. In determining the opening balance of operating and finance lease liabilities and ROU assets at the transition date, the Company first determined all future fixed payments associated with lease components as well as any unamortized deferred rent or lease incentives; capitalized values were then determined by applying a discount rate equal to the Company's incremental borrowing rate based consistently upon the remaining lease periods and any inflation-linked indexes known at the transition date.

 For new leases, at contract inception, Solenis reviews the facts and circumstances of an arrangement to determine if the contract is a lease under ASC 842. Primarily, the Company follows the guidance codified in ASC 842-10-15 and considers the following criteria: (1) Whether the contract identified a specific asset for use either explicitly or implicitly and if substitution rights exist, (2) If the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the asset, and (3) If the Company has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset. If determined to contain a lease, the Company proceeds to determine whether the lease is classified as either an operating or finance lease based on an underlying assessment of the substance of ownership and control similar to the finance lease assessment previously completed under ASC 840. Once classification has been determined, the Company will assess the lease term equal to the non-cancellable period of the agreement, together with all of the periods covered by options which are reasonably certain to be exercised. Once classification and term have been identified, total future fixed minimum payments are assessed based on explicitly noted payments inclusive of known escalations, discounts and payment holidays. These future payment streams are then allocated to lease and non-lease components based on the relative standalone price of each.

 To determine the present value of the future payments assessed as lease components, the Company discounts future fixed payments based upon the rate implicit in the lease agreement or based on the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. When determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers the credit profile of the stand-alone legal entity party to the agreement, the impact of any centralized treasury activities, yields on government or corporate bonds of similar duration as the lease term, as well as any country or currency specific risk premiums. The present value of these obligations is then carried as a lease liability offset by an ROU asset. Minimum lease payments under operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term where as finance lease ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and the related interest expense is recognized on an effective interest method basis. Payments associated with fixed minimum non-lease components are primarily recognized on a straight-line basis while variable payments are expensed as incurred.

 Most leases within the Company's portfolio are classified as operating leases under ASC 842. These leases primarily include agreements for offices, labs and internally managed warehouses. The current portion of Solenis' operating lease liabilities are included within Accrued expenses, while the long-term portion of the Company's operating lease liabilities, and all of its operating lease ROU assets are presented as stand-alone items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases primarily include fleet vehicles, IT equipment, and embedded lease ROU assets for which the useful life of the related asset is primarily consumed during the lease term. Finance lease liabilities are presented within Current portion of long-term debt and finance leases, and Long term debt and

###### Note 12  Debt and Finance Lease Obligations

 In connection with the Acquisition on November 9, 2021, Olympus fully repaid the gross obligations of the Predecessor company's outstanding First Lien Dollar, First Lien Euro, and Second Lien Credit Facility which totaled $2.4 billion as of November 8, 2021. Cash proceeds to extinguish the Predecessor's external debt were made available via Olympus' new term debt and bond offerings which totaled $3.78 billion exclusive of deferred financing costs and original issue discount. As the Predecessor's external debt was paid by Olympus at closing and the debt was not assumed by the buyer, the cash proceeds utilized to extinguish the debt are considered to be a component of the purchase price transferred by Olympus at closing and are presented within Investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

 In connection with the extinguishment of the Predecessor's third party debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discount of $59.5 million were written off and recognized as a loss in the Predecessor period within Non operating (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, realized foreign exchange losses of $17.3 million and previously unsettled accrued interest through November 8, 2021 were expensed in the Predecessor period within Other operating income (expense) and Interest expense, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In connection with the Contribution, Olympus assumed Sigura's $451.0 million of gross external debt. Immediately subsequent to the contribution, Olympus utilized $451.0 million of its term debt and bond proceeds to extinguish the external debt assumed via the Contribution of Sigura.

 On April 6, 2022, Olympus Water US Holding Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) obtained an incremental $300 million tranche (the "Incremental Term Loan USD") to its existing USD denominated term loans ("Term Loan USD"). Total net proceeds of the incremental tranche were $291.6 million which is inclusive of a $6.0 million original issue discount and deferred financing costs of $2.4 million. The sources of the Incremental Tranche were used to pay down $200 million of ABL revolver borrowings that were outstanding as of April 5, 2022. Obligations under the Incremental Term Loan USD accrue interest and are payable quarterly at a rate equal to three-month SOFR plus a spread of 4.6%. Principal payments of $0.75 million are due quarterly, beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The Incremental Tranche matures on November 8, 2028 consistent with the Company's other existing term loans.

 On August 30, 2022, Olympus Water US Holding Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) obtained an incremental $325 million secured USD denominated note (the "Incremental Secured Notes USD"). Total net proceeds from the offering were $309.1 million, inclusive of $12.6 million of deferred financing costs and an original issue discount of $1.3 million. The Incremental Secured Notes USD mature on October 1, 2027 and incur fixed interest of 7.125% per annum, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1. Net proceeds from the Incremental Secured Notes USD were utilized to acquire Clearon on September 9, 2022. Refer to further discussion within Note 4.

###### or (b) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the ABL then in effect, subject to borrowing base capacity.

 Borrowings under the ABL are limited by borrowing base calculations based on the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and unrestricted cash, minus the amount of any applicable reserves. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either an adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or, at the Company's option, a base rate plus an applicable margin. The Company may only borrow on the ABL only up to the lesser of (i) the level of our then-current borrowing base and (ii) our committed maximum borrowing capacity of $500 million. Subject to certain conditions, the ABL may be expanded by up to the greater of (a) the greater of (i) $250 million and (ii) a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA.

 The following fees are applicable under the ABL: (a) an unused line fee of (i) 0.375% per annum of the unused portion of our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any swingline loans) when the average daily unused portion of such facility is less than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the ABL or (ii) 0.250% per annum of the unused portion of the ABL when the average daily unused portion of such facility (excluding any swingline loans) is equal to or greater than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the ABL, (b) letter of credit fees of (i) a participation fee equal to the applicable margin for adjusted Eurodollar rate loans, as applicable, in each case, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit under the ABL and (ii) a fronting fee equal to 0.125% on the average daily amount of undrawn and unreimbursed letters of credit per annum and (c) certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders, letter of credit issuers and agents thereunder. Subject to customary provisions for discretionary and protective overadvances, the Company will be required to make prepayments under the ABL at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of the outstanding loans and letters of credit under the ABL exceeds the then applicable borrowing base.

 The ABL contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the Company's ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates or certain burdensome agreements, modify governing documents or certain junior debt documents or change our line of business.

 The ABL requires the maintenance of a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.00 to 1.00 (tested for the four fiscal quarter period ending on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financials have been delivered, and at the end of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter) during any period commencing on the date when Adjusted Availability is less than the greater of (a) 10% of the Line Cap and (b) $25 million and ending on the date on which Adjusted Availability has exceeded the greater of 10% of the Line Cap and (b) $25 million for at least 30 consecutive calendar days. The ABL provides that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated. Such events of default include payment defaults to the lenders thereunder, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments, pension-plan events reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, certain change of control events and other customary events of default, subject to certain materiality levels, default triggers, cure and grace periods and/or baskets.

 The Company incurred $7.5 million of Deferred Financing fees in connection with the ABL. Deferred financing fees for the ABL are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet within Other Non-Current Assets.

 As of the Successor Period September 30, 2022 the Company's borrowing capacity under the ABL was $376.4 million, with no borrowings outstanding.

 Equipment Financing

 On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a $25.0 million equipment financing (leaseback) arrangement with a third party maturing on December 31, 2023. In accordance with ASC 840-40-25-4 (superseded by ASC 842-10-65-1 in transition), "Sale-Leaseback Transactions", the transaction was accounted for as a financing arrangement and is reflected as debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of both September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2021. Solenis did not account for this transaction as a "sale" as the Company retains the risks and benefits of ownership during the term of the arrangement and has a bargain-purchase option at maturity to re- acquire legal title to the collateralized assets. In connection with the transaction, the Company paid $0.5 million in deferred financing fees which were capitalized at the transaction date and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement.

 Deferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount

 The composition of Deferred Financing Costs and the Original Issue Discount which remain capitalized as of September 30, 2022 are derived from a variety of sources. Specifically, those sources are as follows:

 • Financing costs and original issue discount incurred directly with the Term Loan Agreement, Incremental Term Loan USD, and ABL in addition to the Secured, Incremental Secured, and Unsecured bond offerings completed on October 1, 2021, November 9, 2021, April 6, 2022, and August 30, 2022, respectively;

###### On July 31, 2014, International and Solenis Holdings 3 LLC, then a subsidiary of International, entered into a First Lien Credit Agreement ("First Lien Credit Agreement due 2021"), comprised of a $630.0 million loan ("First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021"), a €230.0 million loan ("First Lien Euro Loan due 2021"), and a $200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolving Credit Facility due 2019"). On that same day, International and Solenis Holdings 3 LLC entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement comprising a $470.0 million loan (the "Second Lien Credit Agreement due 2022"). Subsequent to these transactions, the Company entered into two additional term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement due 2021: one for €85 million during the second quarter of 2015 and one for €100 million during the third quarter of 2016. These agreements are collectively referred to as the "Old Debt".

 On June 26, 2018, Solenis Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the First Lien Credit Agreement (the "First Lien Credit Agreement") which includes a $200 million Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), and a Second Lien Credit Agreement through which the Company borrowed aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion, with original maturity dates of December 2023, and June 2024 for the First Lien Credit Agreement, and Second Lien Credit Agreement, respectively. The First and Second Lien Credit Agreements were consummated to provide net proceeds which facilitated the Joint Venture between Solenis and BASF and allow for an extension of the terms of each of the credit agreements and the Revolving Credit Facility. These agreements are collectively referred to as the "New Debt". The proceeds from each of these borrowings were used in combination with one another to repay the remaining principal balance on the Company's Old Debt.  As part of the closing of the Joint Venture on January 31, 2019, the Company borrowed an incremental $170 million and €330 million under the First Lien Credit Agreement, and increased the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility from $200 million to $375 million, at which time the Company borrowed an incremental $124 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. The closing of the Joint Venture also extended the maturity date of all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement (except for the Revolving Credit Facility) by

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### 18 months, from December 26, 2023 to June 26, 2025, and extended the maturity date of the Second Lien Credit Agreement by 24 months, from June 25, 2024 to June 26, 2026.

 For both the June 26, 2018 refinancing and the incremental borrowing on January 31, 2019 the Company applied the guidance prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discounts related to the original borrowing. All deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with portions of the debt determined to be modified were allocated to the First Lien Credit Agreement due 2025 and Second Lien Credit Agreement due 2026 to be amortized over the life of the associated agreements.

 On February 5, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to supplement its First Lien Credit Agreement which resulted in incremental gross proceeds of $150 million and €100 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on its Revolving Credit facility by the same amount as the incremental proceeds. An incremental debt discount of $1.3 million and incremental deferred financing costs of $1.6 million were capitalized consistent with the guidance prescribed above within ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments. All other terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement remained consistent, including but not limited to, the outstanding indebtedness thereunder being due June 26, 2025.

 On March 1, 2021, the Company and its syndicate of lenders agreed to reduce the fixed component of Solenis' debt service costs by 0.25% with respect to the First Lien Euro Loan while replacing the variable rate floor of 0.5% with zero (the "Repricing"). As the Euro London Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") remains negative as of September 30, 2021, this agreement reduced the Company's debt service costs on its First Lien Euro Loan by 0.75%. The transaction is accounted for as a modification. As such, the Company capitalized incremental deferred financing costs of $1.0 million related to lender fees paid in connection with the transaction.

 First Lien Credit Agreement

 Obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned UK subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"), and, solely by recourse to the equity of the Company, by Solenis UK Industries Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Solenis Holdings Sub II B.V. (collectively, the "Holdings Guarantors"). The First Lien Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions, as well as the equity of the Company held by the Holdings Guarantors. Principal is paid on the last day of each quarter in an amount equal to $2.8 million and €2.0 million for the First Lien Dollar Loan and First Lien Euro Loan, respectively.

 Interest rates on all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement are variable. The First Lien Dollar Loan carries an interest rate of 4.00%, plus the greater of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or 0%. Beginning on March 1, 2021 in connection with the Repricing, The First Lien Euro Loan carries an interest rate of 4.00% plus the greater of the EURIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months.

 Term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement mature on June 26, 2025. The Company is permitted to prepay all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time. The First Lien Loans are subject to mandatory prepayments equal to 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, beginning in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company made a mandatory principal prepayment of $12.4 million based on the calculation of 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow during the year ended September 30, 2020. 


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### The obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are effectively senior to all of the Company's Second Lien Debt and unsecured debt, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations.

 The Revolving Credit Facility allowed maximum borrowings of $375.0 million and would have matured on June 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was at the election of the Borrower, ABR plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum.

 Second Lien Credit Agreement

 The Second Lien Credit Agreement carries the same guaranty and security package as the First Lien Credit Agreement. No principal payments are due in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement until maturity. The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on June 26, 2026.

 The Company is permitted to prepay the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. Prepayments made prior to June 26, 2020 would have incurred a 2% penalty of the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2020 but prior to June 26, 2021 would have incurred a 1% penalty on the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2021 are free of penalty. The prepayment penalty is assessed regardless of whether or not the prepayment was mandatory or voluntary. Through November 8, 2021, the Company had not made any prepayments relative to the Second Lien Credit Agreement.

 The interest rate on the Second Lien Credit Agreement is 8.5% plus the greater of LIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months. The Second Lien Credit Agreement is junior in priority to the First Lien Credit Agreement and senior to all other unsecured debt.

 The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the nature of our business.

 Deferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount

 The composition of Deferred Financing Costs and the Original Issue Discount which remain capitalized as of September 30, 2021 are derived from a variety of sources. Specifically, those sources are as follows:

 • Financing costs and original issue discount incurred directly with the First and Second Lien Credit agreements, as part of the borrowings completed on June 26, 2018, January 31, 2019, February 5, 2020 and with respect to the Repricing as of March 1, 2021;

 • Financing costs and original issue discount carried over from the Old Debt related to portions which were determined to be modified. These amounts generally relate to portions of the debt held by lenders who participated in both syndicates comprising the Old Debt and the June 26, 2018 borrowing;

 • Financing fees paid in connection with December 31, 2019 Equipment Financing.

###### Note 13  Employee Benefit Plans

 Pension Plans

 In connection with the Acquisition and Contribution as well as through the acquisition of Clearon, the Company assumed various defined benefit plan obligations for both current and former employees of certain subsidiaries. Qualifying employees participate in specific defined-benefit pension plans, which typically provide pension payments based on an employee’s length of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or have a cash balance design.

 Additionally, the Company also assumed various long-term employee health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees in connection with the Acquisition and Contribution. These programs are noncontributory and other programs share the cost with retirees through payment of premiums, deductibles and coinsurance provisions.

###### Investment Strategy

 In developing an investment strategy for its defined benefit plans, the Company considered the following factors: the nature of the plans’ liabilities, the allocation of liabilities between active, deferred and retired members, the funded status of the plans, the applicable investment horizon, the respective size of the plans and historical and expected capital market returns. Pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers, which are monitored against investment return benchmarks and our established investment strategy. Investment managers are selected based on an analysis of, among other things, their investment process, historical investment results, and frequency of management turnover, cost structure and assets under management. Assets are periodically reallocated between investment managers to maintain an appropriate asset mix and diversification of investments and to optimize returns.

 Plan assets include both fixed income and traditional equity securities that are allocated across both domestic and international markets. Additionally, certain pension plan assets are dictated by applicable regulations within the respective country.

 The weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows:

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Predecessor

 In order to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, Solenis may create offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 During the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million. As a result of these arrangements, the Company collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.26%, 3.12%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36- month period from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022.

 These contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. On both a retrospective and prospective basis, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss or income until the settlement of the related business transaction at which time the accumulated gain or loss from the contracts will be reclassified into earnings. There was no ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument recognized during the predecessor period.

 For the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021 Solenis reclassified expense of $9.2 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Non operating (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2021 and Predecessor period ended September 30, 2020 Solenis reclassified expense of $18.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the paid and accrued interest recognized on the Company's interest rate swap liability.

 In connection with the Acquisition, the indebtedness held by the Predecessor company was fully repaid and as a result the interest rate swaps were effectively settled. Solenis repaid $11.1 million of interest rate swap liabilities and reclassified expense of $9.2 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Predecessor period.

 The following table presents the location and fair values using Level 2 inputs of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):

**September 30, 2021**

Accrued expenses: $ 13,839


Total liabilities $ 13,839


###### While Solenis partially mitigated the market driven interest rate risk on its term debt through the use of interest rate swaps, the Company has historically experienced significant foreign exchange risk on its First Lien Euro Loans. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had First Lien Euro Loans of $899.8 million (EUR 777.2 million). To mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with these loans on a go-forward basis, management determined to pursue solutions without incurring the cost or underlying risks associated with derivative financial instruments.


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Effective April 1, 2021, the Company determined to utilize an intercompany Euro denominated note between two downstream consolidated subsidiaries to act as a hedging instrument in response to the foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's consolidated EUR net asset exposure (i.e. the "hedged item"). The intercompany note will act as a "net investment hedge" through which changes in the USD equivalent of the intercompany note will be recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) rather than through the Consolidated Statements of Operations as is common for foreign currency denominated monetary instruments. The use of an intercompany note is permissible under ASC 815-20, Derivatives, only to the extent that the intercompany note reflects the consolidated foreign exchange risk of the consolidated company, and the entity party to the third-party debt instrument is the counterparty to the intercompany note designated as a hedging instrument. As of April 1, 2021 and through November 8, 2021, Solenis meets both of these criteria required to assume a net investment hedge.

 Each month, Solenis redesignates a specific amount of Euro denominated intercompany notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro net assets. The Company's designation is limited to the lowest value in the subset of data points among: 1) The total Euro value of the intercompany note outstanding, 2) The total Euro value of Solenis' consolidated First Lien Euro Loans, and 3) The total Euro value of Solenis' net assets in consolidated subsidiaries that utilize a Euro functional currency. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had designated EUR 777.2 million of its intercompany Euro notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with the Company's $816.1 million of consolidated Euro net assets (relative to total First Lien Euro Loans of EUR 777.2 million). During the year ended September 30, 2021, Solenis recognized Other comprehensive income of $10.4 million as a result of its net investment hedge, effectively representing deferrals of foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the Company's First Lien Euro Loans. No reclassifications of Other comprehensive income (loss) specific to the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the next 12 months.

 During the Predecessor period November 8, 2021, the Company deferred incremental unrealized gains on its EUR term loans of $1.1 million to Other Comprehensive Income. In connection with the settlement of its existing debt for the Olympus closing which removes the underlying hedged item critical to ensure the effectiveness of the Net Investment Hedge, the Company reclassified the $10.4 million and $1.1 million of unrealized gains deferred in the collective Predecessor periods (total of $11.5 million) to realized gains within Non operating expense (income), net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021.

###### Deferred Purchase Price on Accounts Receivable Financing

 On March 26, 2018, the Company entered into an arrangement to sell accounts receivable under the terms of a RPA with ING, covering trade receivables in various EMEA jurisdictions, Canada, and the United States.

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING agreed to continue serving non-US markets for a maximum capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum RPA capacity carried by MUFG is $75 million to serve the US market. The RPA agreement with MUFG was scheduled to expire in March of 2022.

 In connection with the Acquisition, Solenis fully repaid its outstanding obligations to MUFG of $46.7 million, inclusive of accrued interest through November 8, 2021 of $0.1 million. The reduction of Solenis' principal obligations was recognized as a net increase to Accounts Receivable and Sold Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $46.6 million, while the $0.1 million of interest expense was recognized via Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021. As of November 9, 2021, Olympus remains party to the ING RPA and will continue to sell receivables in certain European markets and Canada. Various amended RPAs with ING have been executed since March 20, 2020, with a current expiration date of January 31, 2024. Refer to Note 6 for additional details.

 Initial consideration received through the Accounts Receivable Financing included a subordinated interest in transferred receivables collected, referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price. The DPP is carried at fair value and is remeasured weekly to reflect activity during the period (i.e. the Company's interest in subsequently-transferred receivables and collections on receivables previously sold to ING or MUFG) as well as changes in estimates of


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. The fair value of the DPP is predicated upon the underlying receivables which have been transferred to ING or MUFG. As the underlying receivables represent the Company's customers with the highest credit quality and are generally collectible within 90 days, the Company expects the fair value of the DPP to be equal to its face value.

 Receivables under the Accounts Receivable Financing are transferred to ING or MUFG daily, weekly, or monthly in accordance with the prevailing agreement for each jurisdiction. The consideration for the transfer of these receivables is incremental DPP to be settled at each settlement date, as defined in the RPAs.

 As the receivables transferred to ING and MUFG do not have an active market for equivalent or similar assets, the Company's fair value assessment is predicated upon its own history of collection surrounding the specific customers' receivables which have been transferred. Accordingly, such inputs qualify as Level 3 inputs. Due to the high credit quality and the relatively short-term nature of the underlying receivables, fluctuations in credit quality are expected to have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the DPP.

 Note 15  Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation

 Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments

 In connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture with BASF on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a number of "take or pay" contracts (the "Supply Agreements") through which BASF will make certain materials required to service acquired BASF legacy customers available to Solenis based upon a combination of legacy BASF volumes for these materials and available manufacturing capacity. The term of these agreements is either three (the "Medium Term"), or eight years (the "Long Term"). Upon maturity, each of the Medium Term agreements will automatically extend for 12 months on a revolving basis unless either party provides 24 months notice of their intention to exit the agreement. There is no penalty for either party to exit provided the 24 month notice period is met. Upon maturity, each of the Long Term agreements will expire immediately unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Solenis and BASF.

 Given the substantial capital and working capital requirements necessary to maintain available capacity and meet Solenis' purchasing requirements, the Company is required to remit minimum monthly payments (the "Fixed Manufacturing Costs") designed to cover BASF's plant overhead costs specific to the impacted production lines. The monthly payments are fixed and determinable, based on allocations of BASF's heritage costing structure relative to expected production and volumes and vary only based upon annual changes in inflation rates observable in the public domain. 

 During the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021, and the Predecessor periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, total Fixed Manufacturing Costs incurred were $62.9 million, $6.6 million, $75.2 million and $72.0 million respectively.

2023 $ 69,453

2024 69,453

###### Due to the nature of Solenis' business, the Company is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety. The total reserves for environmental remediation reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries.

 Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multi- party sites. 

 In connection with the JV, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis. During the diligence process related to the acquisition, Solenis performed diligence related to potential environmental or other contingent liabilities. As no probable or estimable exposure existed at the acquisition date, Solenis is not indemnified with respect to any environmental or other contingent matters. As of both the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and Predecessor period September 30, 2021, the Company does not have material contingent obligations which are both probable and estimable related to these production facilities, transferred employees, or other real property acquired from BASF.

 As of both the Successor Period September 30, 2022 and Predecessor Period September 30, 2021, the Company has recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, related to two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. These reserves are included as part of other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Given the limited time frame over which remediation activities are expected to be performed, the Company has not discounted any projected future cash outflows in determining these reserves as of September 30, 2022.

 Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million relates to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million relates to management's best estimate for potential exposure related to ground contamination at the Company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a potential Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management's best estimate of total expenses to be incurred, made with the assistance of a third-party specialist.


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Indemnification assets associated with environmental remediation claims are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of Other assets in the amount of $1.0 million as of both Successor Period September 30, 2022 and Predecessor Period September 30, 2021, respectively.

 Other Legal Proceedings

 In addition to the matters described above, there are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings that are pending or threatened. Such actions seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts.

 The Company has accrued for legal reserves of $2.8 million and $2.3 million as of the Successor Period September 30, 2022 and the Predecessor Period September 30, 2021, respectively. While Solenis cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, the Company believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions.

 Insurance

 Solenis maintains deductibles for general liability, business interruption and property damage to owned, leased and rented property. These deductibles could be material to our earnings, but they are not material to our overall financial position. The Company carries substantial excess general liability, property and business interruption insurance above our deductibles. In addition, Solenis meets all statutory requirements for automobile liability and workers’ compensation.

 Note 16  Partners' Equity and Shareholders' (Deficit)

 Successor

 The share-based plan of Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. is held at Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. which is a holding company above the consolidation of Olympus Water Holdings, IV, L.P. The presentation of share-based equity awards is represented in the caption, Partners' Equity, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022. Refer to Note 17 for the reconciliation of outstanding awards under the Equity Incentive Plan as well as details related to share-based compensation.

 Contribution of Equity

 From time to time certain directors, officers and management are invited to purchase shares of Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. Given Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. is above the consolidation for the Company, the equity activity is accounted for as a contribution of equity.

 Return of Capital

 Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. repurchases shares from directors, officers and management who leave the Company. Given Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. is above the consolidation, the Company accounts for the repurchase as a return of capital from Partners' equity.

###### Note 17  Share-based Compensation

 Successor

 Stock Incentive Plan

 Effective November 9, 2021, the Company's board of directors adopted the Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to which the Company's board of directors shall select officers and key employees and directors to participate in the plan and grant stock options and offer opportunities to purchase shares. The plan allows for the issuance of up to 13,229,989 common units under the plan (for all share-based compensation and share purchases). All stock options granted have a term not greater than ten years. Stock options vest and become exercisable, in whole or in part, with vesting conditions set by the Company's Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2022, 1,701,462 options were available for grant.

 The options are provided in two separate grants which for accounting purposes have one vesting condition. Service Options vest in four equal annual installments, coinciding with the first anniversary date of the grant date and each successive anniversary thereafter. Performance Options vest only upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or Public Offering if after giving effect to such Change in Control or Public Offering the Investors realize a pre-tax, cash-on-cash return equal to a multiple of its invested capital with respect to the Company of at least 2.0x (the “MOIC Hurdle”), subject to the Employee’s continued employment through the date of such Change in Control or Public Offering. The vesting Service and Performance Options are contingent upon continuous employment through the respective measurement dates.

 Stock Options

 The Stock incentive plan allows stock option grants for shares at a price based on the most recent valuation of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of the grant and may be subject to anti-dilution. Stock options under the plan aren't exercisable unless a change of control event. Every option equals one share. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

 Due to the market condition criteria that exists for employees to exercise service and performance based options Share-based compensation expense is not recognized under the Plan until an event occurs that would trigger a Change in Control or Public Offering.

 The fair value assumptions used to arrive at this fair value for Time Based options using Black-Scholes inputs are as follows:

**September 30, 2022**

**Service-Based options**


Weighted average expected dividends —%


Weighted average expected volatility 48.00%


Weighted average risk free rate 1.00

Weighted average expected life (in years) 6.25

###### The per-option weighted average grant-date fair value of Service options granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 is $3.54.


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### To estimate the expected life for stock option term, the Company used the simplified method as the awards were granted at fair value and Solenis, a privately-held company, has limited exercise history. The risk-free rates for periods within the expected life of the awards are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 The board of directors does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. Volatility is based upon peer groups as the Company is privately-held. As Solenis is not publicly traded, the market value of the stock is estimated based upon third-party valuations.

 Based upon the vesting conditions of the Performance options the Company is required to value these awards in accordance with the Market Condition definition in ASC 718-10-20. The per-option weighted average grant-date fair value of performance options granted during the period ended September 30, 2022 is $2.06. 

 Stock option activity for Service and Performance Options from November 9, 2021 through September 30, 2022 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands except for per option data):

###### For the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 there were no exercises and therefore, no cash received for the exercise of stock options.

 Stock Appreciation Rights

 Certain employees were granted Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), representing stock awards to be settled in cash. The Company recognized these as liability-classified awards in accordance with ASC 718. Consistent with our equity based awards, the Company has SARs which vest in accordance with service ("Service SARs") and performance ("Performance SARs") conditions. SAR based compensation is included as a part of Selling, general, and administrative expenses.

 Stock appreciation rights issued under the plan are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using Black- Scholes inputs applicable at the reporting date for the service component and using a Monte Carlo simulation for the performance SARs based on their market condition vesting.

 As of September 30, 2022, the fair value of SARs outstanding was $0. There were no outstanding SARs which were exercisable as of September 30, 2022,

###### Predecessor

 Stock Incentive Plan

 Effective July 8, 2014, the Company's board of directors adopted the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to which the Company's board of directors shall select officers and key employees and directors to participate in the plan and grant stock options and offer opportunities to purchase shares. The plan allows for the issuance of up to 6,500,000 Class B shares under the plan (for all share-based compensation and share purchases). All stock options granted have a term not greater than ten years. Stock options vest and become exercisable, in whole or in part, with vesting conditions set by the Company's Board of Directors.

 The options are provided in two separate grants which have differing vesting conditions. Service Options vest in four equal annual installments, coinciding with the first anniversary date of the grant date and each successive anniversary thereafter. Performance Options vest upon the conclusion of each of the four fiscal years subsequent to the grant date based on the achievement of specified "EBITDA" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; subject to management adjustments) targets during the fiscal year in which they vest. The extent of vesting is based on the Company's financial performance relative to EBITDA targets stipulated by the Board of Directors. The vesting of both Service and Performance Options are contingent upon continuous employment through the respective measurement dates.

 On January 31, 2019, the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan was superseded by the Solenis UK International Limited Stock Incentive Plan ("the Plan") as part of the closing of the Joint Venture. All outstanding Service Options to purchase shares in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. were converted to options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. Service Options which were vested were exchanged for fully vested options. Unvested Service Options were exchanged for Service Options with identical vesting periods to the canceled awards. 

 In connection with the JV, all holders of Class A and B shares were provided with a return of capital conveyed in cash to facilitate the required equity holdings amongst the JV participants (CD&R, BASF and management shareholders). In addition, and to uphold the anti-dilutive provision of the Plan, the intrinsic value of all Class B options was kept constant through a reduction of option exercise prices equal to the per-share value of the return of capital conveyed to all Class A and B equity holders. In circumstances where this was not possible due to limitations under Section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company compensated option holders in cash totaling $4.4 million. This cash is considered to be a return of capital and presented as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.


-----

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### The Company applied the guidance prescribed by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding the cancellation of the old awards and simultaneous grant of new awards. Based on the prescribed guidance, the Company determined that the two transactions, in combination, represent a modification of the original award. Subsequent accounting for modifications is predicated upon the fair value of the original award immediately before and the new award immediately after the modification. Management's analysis concluded that the fair value of the new award did not exceed the fair value of the old award on the modification date. Therefore, the Company will continue to ratably recognize the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the original awards based on the fair value of the awards as of the original grant date over the remaining vesting period.

 In connection with the Acquisition all unvested Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units issued under the Predecessor Stock Plan immediately vested in accordance with the Change in Control provisions within the Solenis UK International Limited Stock Incentive Plan. All Stock Options and SARs were immediately canceled on November 9, 2021 in exchange for cash pursuant to each option holders's intrinsic value on the Acquisition.  All unvested Restricted Stock Units were immediately canceled exchanged for cash. All payments were made net of applicable employee taxes and withholdings.

 Solenis recognized $14.2 million of compensation expense in the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021 related to Stock Options, RSUs and SARs. The Change in Control did not create a stock modification event, therefore, there was no incremental expense, other than the unrecognized compensation as of September 30, 2021, for stock options and the immediate vesting of the RSU's.

 Stock Options

 Stock incentive plan allows stock option grants for shares at a price based on the most recent valuation of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of the grant and may be subject to anti-dilution. Stock options under the plan become exercisable over four equal annual installments. Every option equals one share. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

 Share-based compensation expense is recognized as a component of Selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company records compensation expense related to all stock awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards. Compensation expense for Service Options is recognized over the requisite service period, while expense for Performance Options is recognized over the performance period based on successful achievement of performance-based conditions or targets.

Volatility is based upon peer groups as the Company is privately-held. As Solenis is not publicly traded, the market value of the stock is estimated based upon third-party valuations.

 There were no stock options exercised in the period ending November 8, 2021 and therefore, there was no cash received.

 Stock Appreciation Rights

 Certain employees were granted Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), representing stock awards to be settled in cash. The Company recognized these as liability-classified awards in accordance with ASC 718. Consistent with our equity based awards, the Company has SARs which vest in accordance with service ("Service SARs") and performance ("Performance SARs") conditions. SAR based compensation is included as a part of Selling, general, and administrative expenses.

 Like the Service Options, Service SARs originally issued as part of the Plan which participated in the appreciation of the price of Class B Shares were converted to rights to participate in share price appreciation of the Company's Ordinary shares. Strike prices were revised in accordance with the Plan's anti-dilution provision.

 No Performance SARs have been granted during period ending November 8, 2021.

 Stock appreciation rights issued under the plan are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using Black- Scholes inputs applicable at the reporting date. Differences in fair value between reporting dates are recognized in earnings as part of Selling, general, and administrative expense to the extent that awards have vested or are expected to vest. 

 Restricted Stock Units

 In February 2020, certain members of the management team were granted a total of 1.1 million Restricted Stock Units ("2020 RSU") with a term of seven years and vesting contingent upon a combination of a liquidation event (Performance Obligation), the implied per-share equity value of the liquidation event at a pre-defined minimum threshold amount (Market Condition), and that a grantee continues to render service until the date of the liquidation event (Service Condition).

 Vesting of the RSU's range between 70% - 100%, where 70% is at minimum pre-defined exit price per share and 100% is at maximum pre-defined exit price per share.

 In the event of vesting, grantees shall receive cash proceeds within 75 days of the liquidity event. Although, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, the cash proceeds may be required for an equity contribution back to the Company.

###### upon the vesting conditions of the 2021 RSU awards Solenis was required to value these awards using the Black- Scholes simulation in accordance with the Performance Condition definition in ASC 718-10-20. The grant date fair value of the 2020 RSU's was $5.64 per unit. Solenis recognized $2.6 million in stock compensation expense in connection with the vesting of these awards.

 In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, vesting of these awards is contingent upon performance obligations and market conditions which are outside of management's control and such conditions cannot be assumed or estimated based on lack of history and potential outcomes. As the likelihood of achievement of the Performance condition cannot be assessed as "probable", no compensation expense will be recognized until the performance condition is achieved.

 Note 18  Restructuring and Severance Activities

 The Company's strategic growth objectives either through acquisition or organic opportunities are partially driven by cost synergies which reduce the long-term costs required to serve Solenis' customers. These long-term cost synergies are often actioned through specific reductions in force. As a result of these programs, Solenis incurred severance charges of $3.4 million during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 as well as less than $0.1 million, $5.5 million and $21.3 million during the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 and the Predecessor periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Of the total severance charges incurred, the amounts reflected within Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $0.6 million during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and less than $0.1 million in each of the other three Predecessor periods.

 Severance reserves are included in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table details the amount and activity of severance reserves related to these programs (in thousands):

Of this amount, $325.8 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $430.8 million expires between 2022 and 2040. These losses were assessed for realizability and any amount that is not more likely than not to be realized was offset by a valuation allowance.

 Unrecognized tax benefits

 U.S. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the accounting and financial statements disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step requires Solenis to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### requires Solenis to recognize in the consolidated financial statements each tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria, measured at the amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Solenis had $52.3 million and $42.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 

 A tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is shown below (in thousands):

###### Solenis recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Solenis had $13.6 million and $5.3 million in interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.

 The Company recognized deferred tax assets in the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2018 related to tax benefits attributable to intercompany mergers. During 2018, the Company discovered that statutorily related filing requirements had not been timely filed. While the Company intends to pursue the matter through available legal channels, the benefits do not meet the criteria for recognition resulting in an Unrecognized Tax Benefit and similarly has not recognized benefit for the 2018 transaction. As of the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, the Company has recorded incremental penalties and interest as a result of the previously Unrecognized Tax Benefits from the 2018 transaction.

 Solenis or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Solenis' U.S. federal and state tax returns are currently not under audit in any taxing jurisdiction. With respect to countries outside of the United States, with certain exceptions, Solenis’ foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits for years after 2015.

 The Company has not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and, as of the Successor period of September 30, 2022, were $32.5M. These earnings have been reinvested in active non-US business operations and the Company does not intend to repatriate these earnings to the parent entity to fund operations. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes have been provided for earnings of affiliates and associated companies where the Company plans to remit those earnings.

##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

###### Switzerland Tax Reform

 The Swiss government has enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as The Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), which included significant changes to the Swiss corporate income tax system. Most notable among the changes is the phase out of the mixed company regime and a corresponding increase in the cantonal tax rate. During the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, the Company received a Swiss tax ruling that granted a step up on hidden reserves that can be utilized to effectively offset the increased tax rate. The Company has recorded the corresponding impact of these items in the consolidated financial statements for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022.

 COVID-19 Legislation

 During the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2020, tax relief legislation was passed in a number of countries to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the United States’ Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020. The Company evaluated the legislative provisions in the CARES Act and implemented a number of changes deemed applicable, including the temporary increase of the interest expense limitation from 30% to 50%, the temporary removal of the 80% limitation on net operating losses, and the temporary deferral of the Company's social security tax responsibilities. The Company has reflected the impact of these changes within its consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2021. No impact has been recorded for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 and Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as these provisions have expired.

 Note 23  Hyperinflationary Economies

 On May 16, 2018 and on March 16, 2022, the International Practices Task Force categorized Argentina and Turkey, respectively, as countries with highly-inflationary economies. Accounting Standards Codification 830, Foreign Currency Matters, requires entities domiciled in these jurisdictions to change their functional currency to the reporting currency of its parent entity on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter after this determination has been made.

 The Company consolidates wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkey for which the functional currency of these entities has historically matched their respective local currencies. Solenis Argentina, S.A. ("Solenis Argentina") and Solenis Turkey Kimya Limited Sirketi ("Solenis Turkey") sell direct to end customers exclusively in their domestic markets. The Company does not have manufacturing facilities in either subsidiary and accordingly, the majority of its net assets are current to support local distribution activities. Revenues specific to Solenis Argentina and Solenis Turkey are presented below in the aggregate during periods in which local economies were deemed hyperinflationary (in thousands):

###### The Company will continue to evaluate the inflationary environment in Argentina and Turkey for any changes to this status. Until such time in which it is determined that the economies are no longer highly inflationary, the functional currencies of Solenis Argentina and Solenis Turkey will remain the United States Dollar.

 During the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021, and the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized losses of $2.3 million, $0, $1.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively in remeasurement losses as a result of the hyperinflationary economic environments in Argentina and Turkey in which the Company has consolidated subsidiaries. 

 Note 24 Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries

 On January 4, 2021, the directors of Solenis Trinidad and Tobago Limited, a subsidiary of the Company ("Solenis Trinidad"), passed a special resolution to commence liquidation procedures via a voluntary members winding-up. To facilitate the liquidation, the directors appointed a third-party administrator on the same date and effectively relinquished control of Solenis Trinidad. As such and in accordance with ASC 810-10-40- Consolidation (and Derecognition), management determined the loss of control requires the deconsolidation of the subsidiary and a write-off of the previously consolidated net assets. Upon deconsolidation, Solenis recorded a loss of $18 million in the Predecessor prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. In consideration of the liquidation efforts, Solenis recorded the residual fair value of its non-controlling interest of $2.5 million, equal to the value of cash on hand and other net working capital items controlled by the administrator which were previously reflected on the balance sheets of Solenis Trinidad in consolidation. The fair value of the non-controlling interest is reflected within Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the Successor Period September 30, 2022, and the Predecessor Period September 30, 2021. Management anticipates the liquidation procedures will be completed by December 31, 2022.

 Resulting from the liquidation, Management reviewed the criteria for the presentation of results within discontinued operations as reflected within ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations, noting that Solenis Trinidad represents less than 1% of the Company's total assets and annualized revenues and accordingly, the liquidation does not represent a strategic shift required to present items within discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of Solenis Trinidad are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to January 4, 2021.

**NOTE 1 - THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

**Description of Business**

Diversey Holdings, Ltd. (hereafter the "Company", “we”, “us”, and “our”) is a leading global provider of high-performance hygiene, infection prevention
and cleaning solutions. We develop mission-critical products, services and technologies that save lives and protect our environment. We were formed as an
exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with limited liability on November 3, 2020 for the purpose of completing an initial
public offering of our ordinary shares and related transactions and in order to carry on the business of our indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries.

**_Take-Private Merger Agreement_**

On March 8, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership (“Parent”), acting by its General Partner, Olympus Water Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company
incorporated with limited liability, and Diamond Merger Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger
Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into us (the “Merger”), with us continuing as the surviving company as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. If the Merger is completed, our ordinary shares will be removed from listing on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) and
deregistered under the Exchange Act and we will no longer file periodic reports with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub are affiliates of Platinum Equity,
LLC ("Platinum") and affiliates of Solenis LLC, which is a portfolio company of Platinum. Pursuant to the Merger, each ordinary share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (other than (i) ordinary shares held by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) ordinary shares to which the holder has validly exercised and perfected and not effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to dissent under the applicable provisions of the Companies Act (2023 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, and (iii) ordinary
shares held by BCPE Diamond Investor, LP ("BCPE"), our controlling shareholder and an entity advised by Bain Capital Private Equity, LP) will be
cancelled and exchanged at the effective time of the Merger into the right to receive merger consideration of $8.40 in cash without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding taxes. Ordinary shares held by BCPE, other than the Rollover Shares (as defined below), will be cancelled and exchanged at the
effective time of the Merger into the right to receive merger consideration of $7.84 in cash without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes.

On March 8, 2023, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, BCPE separately entered into the Rollover Contribution Agreement with
Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (“Topco”), an affiliate of Platinum and, following the consummation of
the Merger, our indirect parent, pursuant to which BCPE has agreed to contribute, transfer and assign all of its right, title and interest in certain of its
ordinary shares (the “Rollover Shares”) to Topco (and in certain circumstances, a subsidiary of Topco) (such Rollover Shares being valued at $7.84 per
ordinary share), and Topco has agreed to concurrently accept (or if applicable, cause its subsidiary to accept) such Rollover Shares in exchange for the
issuance to BCPE of certain common and preferred units of Topco, or in certain circumstances, common units of Topco and preferred interests of a
subsidiary of Topco.

The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver, where permissible pursuant to applicable law) of
certain conditions, including receipt of the affirmative vote of holders of ordinary shares representing the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes
cast by the holders of ordinary shares present and voting in person or by proxy at the extraordinary general meeting (the “Requisite Shareholder
Approval”), the expiration of waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain
other specified regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Subject to the satisfaction (or, if applicable, waiver) of such conditions, the
Merger is expected to close in the second half of 2023.

We have agreed to pay Parent $92,000,000 in cash upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances. Parent has agreed to pay us
$125,000,000 in cash upon the termination of the Merger Agreement under certain other circumstances.


**_Tax Receivable Agreement and TRA Termination Agreement_**


We previously entered into a tax receivable agreement (the “TRA”) with the previous owners of the Company and certain other members of management
(the “TRA Recipients”). The TRA requires us to make payments to the TRA Recipients for 85% of the tax benefits realized by us when utilizing certain
U.S. and Dutch income tax attributes generated, or owned by, or attributable to, us on or prior to the date of our initial public offering, and any tax
deductions available to us that relate to the transaction expenses incurred by us as a result of the consummation of the initial public offering. We expect to
utilize a significant portion of these income tax attributes based on current projections of taxable income, and therefore, expect to realize tax benefits. The
annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such tax benefits.
Under the TRA, generally, we will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings. Our liability under the TRA on an undiscounted
basis was $200.4 million and $204.5 million as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, of which $1.4 million and $1.6 million is
presented within Other current liabilities, and $199.0 million and $202.9 million is presented within Other non-current liabilities on the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we, Diversey Holdings I (UK) Limited, a private limited company organized in England and
Wales, and BCPE Diamond Cayman Holding Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted corporation, entered into the Tax Receivable Termination Agreement
(the "TRA Termination Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, the parties agreed to terminate the TRA, with such termination effective upon
the consummation of the Merger. From and after the effective date of the TRA Termination Agreement, no payments will be made to any person in respect
of, or pursuant to, the TRA.

**Nature of Operations**

We are a leading global provider of high performance hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning solutions for the Institutional and Food & Beverage
markets. In addition, we offer a wide range of value added services, including food safety and application training and consulting, as well as auditing of
hygiene and water management. Our Institutional business provides solutions serving end-users such as healthcare facilities, food service providers, retail
and grocery outlets, educational institutions, hospitality establishments, and building service contractors. Our Food & Beverage business provides solutions
serving manufacturers in the brewing, beverage, dairy, processed foods, pharmaceutical, and agricultural markets. Although our cleaning products represent
only a small portion of our customers’ total cleaning costs, they are typically viewed as being non-discretionary because they can have a meaningful impact
on the efficacy of food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic further reinforced the essential nature of our solutions
and increased hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning standards across all markets.

The product range of Diversey®-branded solutions includes fully integrated lines of products and dispensing systems for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting
and sanitizing, hand washing, deodorizing, mechanical and manual ware washing, hard surface and carpeted floor cleaning systems, cleaning tools and
utensils, fabric care for professional laundry applications comprising detergents, stain removers, bleaches and a broad range of dispensing equipment for
process control and management information systems. Floor care machines are commercialized under the well-established Taski® brand.

We are globally operated with manufacturing facilities, sales centers, administrative offices and warehouses located throughout the world, and we have a
global team of approximately 9,000 employees as of March 31, 2023.

**Basis of Presentation**

Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all of the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries. These Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements reflect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows


-----

and changes in stockholders' equity in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All amounts are in US Dollar denominated millions, except per share amounts and unless
otherwise noted, and are approximate due to rounding.

The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S.
GAAP for complete annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements include all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the full year. The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited financial
statements of the Company and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2022 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

**NOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Use of Estimates**

The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosures of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods. These estimates include, among
other items, purchase price accounting, assessing the collectability of receivables, the use and recoverability of inventory, the estimation of the fair value of
financial instruments, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, assumptions used in our defined benefit
pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, fair value measurement of assets, rebate costs, costs for incentive compensation, the valuation
allowance on deferred tax assets and accruals for commitments and contingencies. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions periodically and
reflects the effects of any revisions in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in the period management determines any revisions to be
necessary. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

**New Accounting Guidance**

We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB").
ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial
statements.

**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance
Program Obligations. The new guidance is expected to improve the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring that a buyer in a supplier
finance program disclose sufficient qualitative and quantitative information about the program to allow a user of its financial statements to understand the
program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. ASU No. 2022-04 is effective for us as of January 1,
2023 on a retrospective basis including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement to disclose roll-forward information, which is
effective for us as of January 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted ASU No. 2022-04 effective January 1, 2023, as we implemented a supplier
finance program in 2023. However, the activity during the three months ended March 31, 2023 is not significant, and the adoption of ASU 2022-04 did not
have a significant impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the first quarter of 2023.

**NOTE 3 - REVENUE RECOGNITION**

**Description of Revenue Generating Activities**

We provide high-performance cleaning, infection prevention and hygiene products for the food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations,
healthcare, floor care, housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care markets. In addition, we offer a wide range of value-added solutions, including
food safety and application training and consulting, as well as auditing of hygiene and water management. Many of our products are sold through
distributors who then sell the product to end users.

We recognize revenue based on the expected amount of consideration to be received for the provided goods or services, taking into account the expected
value of variable consideration. Our variable considerations include, but are not limited to, rebates, prebates, discounts, and returns. The amount of variable
consideration is estimated at contract inception by using the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Such
variable consideration is re-evaluated each reporting period, and accruals are booked based on the re-evaluated estimates and variable consideration
recognized to date.

Charges for rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the associated revenue is
recorded. When we estimate our rebate accruals, we consider customer-specific contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and history of actual
rebates paid. Our rebate accruals are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. We adjust the accruals to reflect
any differences between estimated and actual amounts. These adjustments impact the amount of net sales recognized by us in the corresponding period of
adjustment. Charges for rebates and other allowances were 28.6% and 24.9% of gross sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31,
2022, respectively.

**Disaggregated Revenue**

Revenues from contracts with customers summarized by region were as follows:

**Three Months Ended March** **Three Months Ended March**

**(in millions)** **31, 2023** **31, 2022**

Europe $ 319.2 $ 291.6
North America 153.2 169.3
Asia Pacific 83.6 83.8
Middle East and Africa 76.4 61.5
Latin America 57.7 48.8
Revenue from contracts with customers 690.1 655.0
Other revenue (Leasing: Sales-type and Operating) 5.9 5.0


Total revenue $ 696.0 $ 660.0

**Assets Recognized For the Costs to Obtain a Contract**

In certain instances, we incur incremental direct costs of a transaction, such as prebates, equipment provided free on loan, or other related expenses in the
contract negotiation phase. Because these costs are likely incurred to transition to a new relationship or part of a negotiated renewal of a long-term
relationship, these costs are considered costs to obtain a contract and are deferred and amortized over the period in which revenue is recognized, provided
that unamortized deferred costs are considered recoverable. These amounts are recorded within Other non-current assets on our Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 5 - Financial Statement Details for further information.

**NOTE 4 - ACQUISITIONS**

We make business acquisitions that align with its strategic business objectives. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded in the
Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value as of their acquisition date. The

|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|Three Months Ended March 31, 2022|

purchase price allocation is based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration paid. Purchase consideration is
reduced by the amount of cash or cash equivalents acquired. Acquisitions during 2023 and 2022 were not significant to our condensed consolidated
financial statements; therefore, pro forma financial information is not presented. Costs incurred related to acquisitions are included as part of Transaction
and integration costs in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**_2023 Activity_**

On February 21, 2023, we acquired NSS Enterprise, Inc., a manufacturer of floor cleaning machines based in the United States for our Institutional
business segment. Certain valuation estimates and net asset adjustments are not yet finalized and are subject to change, but are expected to be finalized in
the second quarter of 2023.

**_2022 Activity_**

On January 24, 2022, we acquired Shorrock Trichem Ltd, a distributor of cleaning and hygiene solutions and services in the United Kingdom for our
Institutional business segment. Certain valuation estimates and net asset adjustments were not finalized until the second quarter of 2022.

**Securitization of trade receivables**

We sell certain North American and European customer receivables to PNC Bank ("PNC") without recourse on a revolving basis. This arrangement
provides for maximum funding of up to $150.0 million for receivables sold. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the
program. The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by a bankruptcy-remote wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, which holds additional
receivables in the amount of $123.6 million as of March 31, 2023 that are pledged as collateral under this agreement.
Fees associated with the arrangement were $2.0 million and $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.

We transferred and derecognized $316.2 million of receivables and collected $323.4 million in connection with our arrangement with PNC during the three
months ended March 31, 2023.

We transferred and derecognized $272.8 million of receivables and collected $253.3 million in connection with our arrangement with PNC during the three

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

On September 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which provided for a new $1,500.0 million senior secured
U.S. dollar denominated term loan (the “2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan”) in addition to the existing $450.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving
Credit Facility", and together with the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan, the “New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan matures
on September 29, 2028, while the Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 28, 2026.

The interest rate under the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan is equal to (i) the Adjusted LIBOR rate (as defined in the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities),
with a LIBOR floor of 0.50%, plus 2.75%, or (ii) ABR (as defined in the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) plus 1.75%. As of March 31, 2023, the
interest rate for the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan is 7.58%.

As of March 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $5.5 million of letters of credit outstanding, which
reduced the available borrowing capacity thereunder to approximately $444.5 million.

As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $5.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, which
reduced the available borrowing capacity thereunder to approximately $444.6 million.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain normal and customary affirmative and negative covenants. Some of the more restrictive covenants are (a)
limitations on our ability to pay dividends, (b) limitations on asset sales, and (c) limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. The New Senior
Secured Credit Facilities also contain various events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the acceleration of all obligations. As of March 31,
2023, we were in full compliance with the provisions contained within the covenants.

**2021 Senior Notes**

On September 29, 2021, we completed the sale of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) in a
private placement to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to
non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021
Senior Notes, together with borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and cash on hand, to redeem all of the €450.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2017 Senior Notes”), pay fees and/or expenses incurred in connection with the issuance of the
2021 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes. The 2021 Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2029, bear interest at 4.625%, and interest is payable
semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2022.

We may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 1, 2024, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
2021 Senior Notes redeemed, plus additional amounts, if any, a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption
date.

We may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, on or after October 1, 2024, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal
amount) set forth in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but
excluding, the applicable redemption date:

**Year** **Percentage**
October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 102.313%
October 1, 2025 to September 30, 2026 101.156%
On or after October 1, 2026 100.000%

Additionally, at any time on or before October 1, 2024, we may elect to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes at a
redemption price equal to 104.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, with the net cash proceeds received from one or more equity offerings of the Company.

The indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness, issue
preferred equity and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; (iii) prepay,
redeem or repurchase certain material debt; (iv) make loans and investments; (v) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; (vi) sell stock of our subsidiaries; (vii)


-----

incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and (x) consolidate,
merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

The 2021 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by a subsidiary of the Company, BCPE
Diamond Netherlands TopCo B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws
of the Netherlands, and our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect material wholly owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee
indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than those organized in Italy).

The Merger, if consummated as contemplated in the Merger Agreement, is expected to constitute a "change of control" with respect the 2021 U.S. Dollar
Term Loan and the 2021 Senior Notes. As such, it is expected that the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan will be repaid and, with respect to the 2021 Senior
Notes, we expect we will either make a Change of Control Offer (as defined in the indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes (the "Indenture")) at a price
equal to the Change of Control Payment (as defined in the Indenture) or redeem (which may include a satisfaction and discharge) the 2021 Senior Notes at
the redemption price set forth in the Indenture, in each case, substantially concurrently with the closing of the Merger.

**Short-term Borrowings**

Our short-term borrowings comprise primarily of bank overdrafts within our notional cash pooling system.

**Sale-Leaseback Transactions**

During March 2020, we completed sale-leaseback transactions under which we sold two properties to an unrelated third-party for a total of $22.9 million.
Concurrent with this sale, we entered into agreements to lease the properties back from the purchaser over initial lease terms of 15 years. The leases for
the two properties include an initial term of 15 years and four, five-year renewal options, and provide for us to evaluate each property individually upon
certain events during the life of the lease, including individual renewal options.

We classified the leases as a financing obligation to be paid over 15 years. The current and non-current portions are included in current portion of long-term
debt and long-term debt, less current portion, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**NOTE 9 - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES**

As a large global organization, we face exposure to market risks, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the
volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative instruments from time to time under our risk management policies. We designate
derivative instruments as hedges on a transactional basis to support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part
or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. We assess the initial and ongoing effectiveness
of our hedging relationships in accordance with our policy. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Our
practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if we determine the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring.

**Interest Rate Cap and Cross Currency Contracts Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedges**

In connection with entering into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and issuing the 2021 Senior Notes, we also entered into a U.S. dollar floating to
Euro fixed interest rate swap, a U.S. dollar interest rate cap, and a U.S.


-----

dollar to Euro currency swap, to manage the impacts of fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates on a portion of our floating-rate and U.S.
dollar denominated debt.

In 2022 we terminated several existing U.S. dollar floating to Euro fixed interest rate swaps and U.S. dollar to Euro currency swaps, receiving net proceeds
of $45.3 million and $186.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2022, respectively, and simultaneously
entered into new at-market swaps with the same notional amounts and maturity dates as the terminated swaps. We elected to classify the cash flows from
the settlements within financing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to be consistent with the cash flows presentation of the
hedged debt instruments.

As a result of these contract terminations, the net unrealized after-tax derivative gains included in Accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") at
the dates of termination are being amortized against Interest expense, and the net unrealized after-tax derivative losses included in AOCI at the dates of
termination are being amortized as Other (income) expense, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining lives of the
derivative contracts. As of March 31, 2023, the unamortized gains in AOCI are $26.2 million and the unamortized losses in AOCI are $7.5 million.

We record gains and losses on these derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax to the extent
the hedges are effective and until we recognize the underlying transactions in net income (loss), at which time we recognize these gains and losses in Other
(income) expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Net unrealized after-tax gains related to these contracts that were included in other comprehensive income was $10.2 million and $38.9 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income will fluctuate based on changes
in the fair value of open contracts during each reporting period.

We estimate that $33.2 million of net unrealized after-tax derivative gain included in AOCI will be reclassified into Interest expense and Other (income)
expense, net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations within the next twelve months.

**Interest Rate Swap Contracts Not Designated as Hedges**

In connection with entering into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and issuing the 2021 Senior Notes, we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate
swap to offset the existing floating to fixed interest rate swap, and the existing swap was also then de-designated as a cash flow hedge. As a result of the
contract de-designation, the net unrealized after-tax derivative loss included in AOCI at the date of de-designation is being amortized into Interest expense
on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining life of the derivative contract, and the unamortized loss in AOCI is $4.3
million as of March 31, 2023. Although the contracts are effective economic hedges, they are not designated as accounting hedges. Therefore, changes in
the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings.

**Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**

The primary purpose of our currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on
equipment and raw material purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currencies. For
those contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, we record gains and losses on other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax to the extent the
hedges are effective and until we recognize the underlying transactions in net income (loss), at which time we recognize these gains and losses in Other
(income) expense, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. For those contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges, the
changes in the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings. These contracts generally have original maturities of less than 12 months.

**Effect of all Derivative Instruments on Income**

The following table details the (income) expense related to our derivative instruments, which are included in Other (income) expense on our Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Operations. These amounts reduce the interest rate impact and transactional impact of foreign exchange, which is primarily the
revaluation of our U.S. dollar denominated debt held at a Euro functional entity, and the net impact is the Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss in Note 5

**NOTE 10 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**Fair Value Measurements**

In determining the fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs to the extent possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine the fair value of our financial
instruments based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When
considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and
unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

     - _Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the_
measurement date.

     - _Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for_
substantially the full term of the asset or liability.

     - _Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available,_
thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.

|$ 0.8 — 0.1 14.0|$ (1.1) (0.2) (0.1) (32.3)|
|$ 14.9|$ (33.7)|

The following table details the fair value hierarchy of our financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:


**March 31, 2023**


**(in millions)** **Total Fair Value** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**
Cash equivalents $ 5.4 $ 5.4 $ — $ —
Cross currency swaps, net liability $ (52.0) $ — $ (52.0) $ —

Foreign currency forward contracts, net liability $ (0.7) $ — $ (0.7) $ —
Interest rate swaps, net liability $ (5.0) $ — $ (5.0) $ —

**Cash Equivalents**

Our cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits (Level 1) and money market funds (Level 1). Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates.

**Derivative Financial Instruments**

Our derivatives are recorded at fair value on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, which incorporates observable market inputs. These market
inputs include foreign currency spot and forward rates and LIBOR. These inputs are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third party
sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable instruments (Level 2).

Counterparties to these derivative instruments are investment grade rated by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Credit ratings on some of our counterparties
may change during the term of our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate
changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the
reporting date.

**Other Financial Instruments**

The following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current
assets, (3) accounts payable and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above
financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.

Other liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets include our debt. We utilize a market approach to
calculate the fair value of our 2021 Senior Notes. Due to the limited investor base and the face value of our 2021 Senior Notes, they may not be actively
traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving
similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields, to calculate the yield to maturity and the price on some of our 2021 Senior Notes. These inputs are
provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.

|---|---|---|---|


-----

We derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing
economic and market conditions, and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our credit default swap
rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt instrument, as applicable. These inputs are provided by an independent third party and
are considered to be Level 2 inputs.

These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore we cannot determine them with precision.
Changes in assumptions could significantly affect our estimates.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt, all of which are based on Level 2 inputs:

**March 31, 2023** **December 31, 2022**

**(in millions)** Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value
2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan (1) $ 1,451.5 $ 1,475.7 $ 1,453.9 $ 1,433.0

(1) Carrying amounts are net of deferred financing costs and original issue discount.

(2) Carrying amount is net of deferred financing costs.

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair
value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as acquisitions.

**Credit and Market Risk**

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or
currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits,
diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.

It is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 or higher by Moody’s.
Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to
perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.

We regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably
possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use
derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally
do not require collateral. We consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and
believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit
sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small
group of customers.

Our net periodic benefit costs for our other post-employment benefit plans was not material for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31,
2022.

**NOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES**

We account for income taxes in interim periods in accordance with ASC 740, which generally requires income tax expense or benefit to be calculated using
an estimated annual effective tax rate applied to the year-to-date ordinary income or loss. Tax effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring items
are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which they occur.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we utilized the discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by ASC 740-270-30-18, “Income Taxes—Interim
Reporting,” to calculate our interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is
impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year to date period as if it was the
annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. We believe that, at this time, the use of this discrete method represents the
best estimate of our annual effective tax rate.

**Effective Income Tax Rate and Income Tax Provision**

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit and the recorded income tax provision was primarily
attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance related to limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and the realizability of net operating
losses.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit and the recorded income tax provision was primarily
attributable to an increase in the valuation allowance related to limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, and income tax expense related to nondeductible shared-based compensation.

**NOTE 13 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

At times, we are subject to governmental investigations and various legal actions and claims from governmental agencies and other parties. The outcomes
of these matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We record a liability in the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the
reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the
range is accrued. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be
recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from these matters are inherently difficult to predict. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of
any current matters should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows.

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory
and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are not reduced by
potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that our liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for
environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever
circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated.

We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of
discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible
parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably
estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not material to our consolidated financial condition or results
of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

**Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations**

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations. These contracts primarily consist of:

     - Product and service warranties with respect to certain products sold to customers in the ordinary course of business. These warranties
typically provide that products will conform to specifications. We generally do not establish a liability for product warranty based on a
percentage of sales or other formulas. We accrue a warranty liability on a transaction-specific basis depending on the individual facts and
circumstances related to each sale. Both the liability and annual expense related to product warranties are immaterial to our consolidated
financial position and results of operations; and

     - Intellectual property warranties by us to third parties in which we have agreed to indemnify the licensee against third party infringement
claims.

**NOTE 14 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Bain Capital**

We may conduct business with Bain Capital, an affiliate of our controlling shareholder and our previous sponsor, for consulting or other services related to
transactions. We paid Bain Capital $0.1 million and zero during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. There were no
fees due to Bain Capital at March 31, 2023 or December 31, 2022.

We may conduct business with other Bain Capital affiliates from time to time in the normal course of business. Although we may have common owners
with these affiliates depending upon the Bain Capital fund ownership structure, we believe the terms of such transactions have historically been comparable
to terms available or amounts that would be paid or received, as applicable, in an arm’s-length transaction with a party unrelated to us.

**NOTE 15 - SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION**

**Compensation Expense**

Share-based compensation expense related to equity and liability awards is included in the following line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Operations:

**Three Months Ended March** **Three Months Ended March**

**(in millions)** **31, 2023** **31, 2022**

Cost of sales $ 1.4 $ (0.4)

(1) During 2018, Constellation S.à r.l, a subsidiary of the Company, adopted a management equity incentive plan consisting of Class B through Class F
shares ("MEIP Shares") granted to certain domestic and foreign employees. Upon closing of our initial public offering, the MEIP Shares were converted
into vested ordinary shares and restricted ordinary shares. The restricted ordinary shares vest on the same terms and conditions as applied to the MEIP
Shares to which they relate, and are not subject to performance conditions. Vesting of restricted ordinary shares is credited to Additional paid-in capital.

There were no awards granted during the three months ended March 31, 2023.

**NOTE 16 - RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES**

In 2021, we began a strategic initiative to consolidate certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities within Europe and North America, which also
includes opening a new manufacturing and warehousing facility in North America. We anticipate that these actions will both expand our production
capacity and allow us to better manage our inventory, supply chain and workforce. We expect to incur approximately $153.0 million of total expenses
related to this project, and have already charged $138.0 million over the life of the project, $18.4 million of which were charged during the three months
ended March 31, 2023. Costs incurred in 2023 of $18.1 million of non-recurring other costs related to facilities consolidations are reflected in Cost of sales
and $0.3 million are reflected in Restructuring and exit costs. Our remaining costs for this project are approximately $15.2 million at March 31, 2023.

Cost estimates for this project have been impacted by an inflationary macro environment with constraints around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary
short-term measures were taken to minimize disruption to customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily setting up
additional warehouses, paying higher freight costs during warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery.

**NOTE 18 - SEGMENTS**

Our operating segments, which are consistent with our reportable segments, reflect the structure of our internal organization, the method by which our
resources are allocated and the manner by which the chief operating decision maker assesses our performance. Our reportable segment structure includes
two segments, Institutional and Food & Beverage.

Our segments are described as follows:

   - Institutional - Our Institutional products and services are designed to enhance cleanliness, safety, environmental sustainability, and efficiency for
our customers. We offer a broad range of products, solutions, equipment and machines including infection prevention and personal care, floor and
building care chemicals, kitchen and mechanical warewash chemicals and machines, dosing and dispensing equipment, and floor care machines.
We deliver these solutions to customers in the healthcare, education, food service, retail and grocery, hospitality, and building service contractors
industries.

   - Food & Beverage - Our Food & Beverage products and services are designed to maximize the hygiene, safety, and efficiency of our customers’
production and cleaning processes while minimizing their impact on the natural resources they consume. We offer a broad range of products,
solutions, equipment and machines including chemical products, engineering and equipment solutions, knowledge-based services, training through
our Diversey Hygiene Academy, and water treatment. We deliver these solutions to enhance food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability
for customers in the brewing, beverage, dairy, processed foods, pharmaceutical, and agriculture industries.

No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. The reportable segments are the segments of the Company for which separate
financial information is available and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. We evaluate performance of the reportable segments based on the results of each segment. The performance metric

used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments is Adjusted EBITDA. Certain amounts within segment
Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, with no impact on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.

As described in Note 1 - The Company and Basis of Presentation, our net sales are comprised of commercial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene products and
solutions for food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations, floor care, housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**


To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Diversey Holdings, Ltd.


**Opinion on the Financial Statements**


We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Diversey Holdings, Ltd. (the Company) as of


December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders'


equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes

(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial


statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and


2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December


31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


**Basis for Opinion**


These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an


opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with


the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal


securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the


PCAOB.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and


perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material


misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of


material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that

respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and


disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and


significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.


We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


**Critical Audit Matters**


The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial


statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to


accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,


-----

subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion


on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit


matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which


they relate.


**_Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessment_**


_Description of the_

_Matter_

_How We_

_Addressed the_

_Matter in Our_

_Audit_


As described in Notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s


consolidated indefinite-lived intangible asset balance was $818.2 million, as of December 31,

2022. Management reviews its indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual


basis as of October 1st of each year or more frequently whenever events or circumstances


indicate that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable.


The Company performed a quantitative approach to test for impairment based on the relief


from royalty method.


Auditing management’s annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test required the

application of greater auditor judgment. Auditing management’s indefinite-lived intangible


impairment analyses was complex and judgmental due to the estimation required in


determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In particular, the fair value

estimates included significant assumptions for the revenue growth rates and the discount rate


which are affected by expectations about macroeconomic and industry specific factors.


We evaluated the Company’s assessment of the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles.


We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of


controls that address the risks of material misstatement related to the indefinite-lived


intangible asset impairment test, including management’s development and review of the


significant assumptions discussed above.


To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset, we


performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing fair value methodologies

and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the

Company in its analysis. For example, we compared the significant assumptions used by

management to current industry and economic trends and the Company’s historical trends


with consideration given to changes in the Company’s business, customer base and other


-----

relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s projected revenue


growth estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate

the changes in the fair value that would result from changes in these assumptions. We tested


the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s valuation


model, which included clerical testing of the valuation model and agreement of prospective


financial information within the model to the Company’s internal forecasts. We involved our


valuation specialist to assist in our evaluation of the Company’s model, valuation


methodologies, and significant assumptions including the discount rate used by management.


**_Goodwill Asset Impairment Assessment_**


_Description of the_

_Matter_

_How We_

_Addressed the_

_Matter in Our_

_Audit_


As described in Notes 3 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s


consolidated goodwill balance was $462.8 million as of December 31, 2022. The Company’s


goodwill is initially assigned to its reporting units as of the acquisition date. Management


reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1st of each year or more


frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may


not be recoverable. The Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill to


determine whether there was a greater than 50 percent likelihood that the fair value of each


reporting unit was less than its carrying value.


Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment test required the application of greater


auditor judgment. Qualitative events and circumstances, such as macroeconomic conditions,


industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, market


capitalization and events specific to the entity and its reporting units, required a higher degree


of auditor judgment to evaluate. These events and circumstances could have a significant


effect on the Company’s qualitative assessment and the determination of whether further


quantitative analysis of goodwill for impairment was required.


We evaluated the Company’s assessment of the impairment of goodwill. We obtained an


understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that


address the risks of material misstatement related to the goodwill impairment test, including


management’s development and review of the qualitative factors discussed above.


To test the qualitative assessment of the Company’s reporting units, we performed audit


procedures that included, among others, considering macroeconomic indicators; evaluating


-----

information from third-party analyst reports across the manufacturing and hygiene solutions

industries; analyzing the financial performance of the consolidated Company and reporting


units including comparison to guideline public companies in the same industry; and


recalculating the Company’s market capitalization and reporting unit carrying value. We


further assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates of future financial


performance, changes in estimated future cash flows, and performed sensitivity analyses of

significant assumptions, such as projected future cash flows and discount rate, to evaluate if


changes in these inputs could indicate that the fair value of the reporting units were more


likely than not less than the carrying value. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in


our evaluation of the significance and sensitivity of the significant assumptions most likely to


affect the fair value of the reporting units.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Diversey Holdings, Ltd.

**Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

We have audited Diversey Holdings, Ltd.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material
weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Diversey Holdings, Ltd. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of
the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in
management’s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses in the design and operation of controls related to existence of inventory held at certain locations and controls
over the timing of revenue recognition and certain information used to estimate customer rebate accruals within the Company’s revenue recognition process.

As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Shorrock Trichem Ltd., which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and
constituted 1.4% and 7.2% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 1.3% and 1.6% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit
of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Shorrock Trichem Ltd.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature,
timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 17, 2023, which expressed an
unqualified opinion thereon.

**Basis for Opinion**

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance
with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

**Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**NOTE 1 - GENERAL AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS**

Diversey Holdings, Ltd. (hereafter the "Company", “we”, “us”, and “our”) is a leading provider of hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning solutions. We develop mission-critical
products, services and technologies that save lives and protect our environment. We were formed as an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with
limited liability, on November 3, 2020 for the purpose of completing a public offering and related transactions and in order to carry on the business of our indirect wholly-owned
operating subsidiaries.

On March 29, 2021, we completed an initial public offering of 46,153,846 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $15.00 per Ordinary Share ("the IPO"), receiving $654.3 million
in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. On April 9, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,000,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the
underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, receiving an incremental $71.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering
expenses. Our Ordinary Shares trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "DSEY".

On November 15, 2021, we issued and sold 15,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $15.00 per Ordinary Share, receiving $214.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting
the underwriting discount and offering expenses.

Prior to the formation of Diversey Holdings, Ltd., the organizational structure consisted of Constellation (BC) 2 S.à r.l ("Constellation"), which was incorporated on June 30, 2017, and
organized under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société à Responsabilité Limitée for an unlimited period under the direction of Bain Capital, LP (“Bain Capital”). Diamond (BC) B.V., an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation, was formed on March 15, 2017 for the purpose of consummating the acquisition of the Diversey Care division and the food hygiene
and cleaning business of Sealed Air Corporation (“Sealed Air”) (together, the “Diversey Business”), including certain assets and all the capital stock of certain entities engaged in the
Diversey Business (the “Diversey Acquisition”), which acquisition closed on September 6, 2017.

Prior to closing of the IPO, we effected a series of transactions (the "Reorganization Transactions") pursuant to which:

(i) Constellation (BC) PoolCo SCA (“Poolco”), an entity incorporated for the purpose of pooling the interests of our employees, directors and officers in Constellation (BC) S.à r.l

(“Topco”), a direct subsidiary of Constellation, repurchased shares from certain equity holders in exchange for a note receivable;

(ii) all other equity holders of Poolco contributed their shares of Poolco to Constellation in exchange for new shares of Constellation; and

(iii) the equity holders of Constellation, including Bain Capital and the individuals referred to in the foregoing clause (ii), contributed a portion of their shares of Constellation to the

Company, and the equity holders referred to in the foregoing clause (i) contributed a portion of their note receivable to the Company, in each case, in exchange for ordinary
shares of the Company (in which the Company withheld a portion of the ordinary shares otherwise issuable solely to the extent necessary to satisfy (y) any outstanding loans
owned by such employee equity holders and (z) any tax consequences resulting to the equity holders from the repurchase, and the aggregate fair market value of such withheld
ordinary shares will be paid by the Company or a subsidiary thereof to satisfy such tax consequence), and the equity holders of Constellation, including Bain Capital and the
individuals referred to in the foregoing clause (ii), contributed the remaining portion of their shares of Constellation to one of our subsidiaries, and the equity holders referred to
in the foregoing clause (i) contributed the remaining portion of their note receivable to one of our subsidiaries, in each case, in exchange for payments to be made under the Tax
Receivable Agreement entered into in connection with the IPO and certain other consideration.

The Reorganization Transactions resulted in the Company becoming the ultimate parent company of Constellation and its subsidiaries, and Bain Capital and all other equity holders of
Constellation and Poolco becoming


-----

shareholders of the Company. In order to simplify our corporate structure, we merged or liquidated certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Constellation, Poolco and Topco,
prior to December 31, 2021. The Reorganization Transactions were considered transactions between entities under common control. As a result, the financial statements for periods prior
to the IPO and the Reorganization Transactions have been adjusted to combine the previously separate entities for presentation purposes.

**Nature of Operations**

We are a leading global provider of high performance hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning solutions for the Institutional and Food & Beverage markets. In addition, we offer a
wide range of value added services, including food safety and application training and consulting, as well as auditing of hygiene and water management. Our Institutional business
provides solutions serving end-users such as healthcare facilities, food service providers, retail and grocery outlets, educational institutions, hospitality establishments, and building
service contractors. Our Food & Beverage business provides solutions serving manufacturers in the brewing, beverage, dairy, processed foods, pharmaceutical, and agricultural markets.
Although our cleaning products represent only a small portion of our customers’ total cleaning costs, they are typically viewed as being non-discretionary because they can have a
meaningful impact on the efficacy of food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic has further reinforced the essential nature of our solutions and
increased hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning standards across all markets.

The product range of Diversey®-branded solutions includes fully integrated lines of products and dispensing systems for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, hand washing,
deodorizing, mechanical and manual ware washing, hard surface and carpeted floor cleaning systems, cleaning tools and utensils, fabric care for professional laundry applications
comprising detergents, stain removers, bleaches and a broad range of dispensing equipment for process control and management information systems. Floor care machines are
commercialized under the well-established Taski® brand.

We are globally operated with manufacturing facilities, sales centers, administrative offices and warehouses located throughout the world, and we have a global team of approximately
9,000 employees as of December 31, 2022.

**NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

Our Consolidated Financial Statements include all of the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries. These Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. All amounts are in U.S. dollar denominated millions, except per share amounts and unless otherwise noted, and are approximate due to
rounding. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial statements have been included. The accompanying notes are an
integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain amounts within Transaction and integration costs (formerly described as "Transition and transformation costs") in the prior
years' Consolidated Statements of Operations have been reclassified into Restructuring and exit costs and Cost of sales to conform to the current year presentation, with no impact on net
loss or accumulated deficit.

**NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

**Use of Estimates**

The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the periods. These estimates include, among other items, purchase price accounting, assessing the collectability of receivables, the use and recoverability
of inventory, the estimation of the fair value of financial instruments, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, assumptions used in our
defined benefit pension plans and other post

-----

employment benefit plans, fair value measurement of assets, rebate costs, costs for incentive compensation, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and accruals for commitments
and contingencies. Management reviews these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflects the effects of any revisions in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period
management determines any revisions to be necessary. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

**Business Combinations**

Business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed
liabilities to be recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired, including separately
identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Fair value determination is subject to a significant degree of estimates. We use a measurement period
following the acquisition date to gather information that existed as of the acquisition date that is needed to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The
measurement period ends once all information is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessments of factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and
liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition. Where appropriate, external advisors are consulted to assist in the determination of fair value. For non-observable
market values, fair value has been determined using acceptable valuation principles (e.g., multiple excess earnings and relief from royalty methods) which is considered to be a Level 3
fair value. Refer to Note 12 - Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments for further information.

The results of operations for businesses acquired are included in the financial statements from the acquisition date.

**Foreign Currency Translation**

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. In most cases, non-U.S. based subsidiaries use their local currency as the functional currency for their respective business operations. Assets and
liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the end of period exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting
period. Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in “Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments” in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss.

Gains and losses from transactions denominated in foreign currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
in Other (income) expense, net.

**Impact of Inflation and Currency Fluctuations**

**_Argentina. Argentina has been designated a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP effective July 1, 2018, and the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional_**
currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina. All peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and any
changes in the exchange rate are reflected in Foreign currency (gain) loss related to hyperinflationary subsidiaries on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**_Turkey. Turkey has been designated a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP effective April 1, 2022, and the U.S. dollar replaced the Turkish lira as the functional currency for_**
our subsidiaries in Turkey. All lira-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rate available to us, and any changes in the
exchange rate are reflected in Foreign currency (gain) loss related to hyperinflationary subsidiaries on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As a result of these designations, we recorded remeasurement gains of $1.9 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and a
remeasurement loss of $1.6 million for the year December 31, 2020.


-----

**Financial Instruments**

We may from time to time use financial instruments, such as cross-currency swaps, interest rate swaps, caps and collars, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and foreign currency exchange
forward contracts and options relating to borrowing and trade activities. We may also use these financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates
and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We face credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions
are unable to perform their obligations. Our policy is to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 by Moody’s.

Derivative instruments are reported at fair value and establish criteria for designation and the effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Before entering into any
derivative transaction, we identify the specific financial risk, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce this risk, and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging
instrument. We use forecasts and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions that do not
have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk trying to be reduced. We regularly review hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging
instruments.

Derivative instruments are accounted for as hedges of the related underlying risks if we designate these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective as
hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions.

We record gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions
are recognized as gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Generally, our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures, is sold or terminated, or if it is determined that the underlying forecasted
transactions are no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the
period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction was recognized. See Note 11 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities for further information.

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring goods or services to customers. Revenue from products and sold equipment to
end customers and distributors represents approximately 98% of our revenue and is recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied, which
generally occurs with the transfer of products or delivery of the equipment. Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer
receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided and
corresponds with the transfer of control. See Note 4 - Revenue Recognition for further information.

Our sales policies do not provide for general rights of return. We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
promotions and other volume-based incentives at the time the sale is recorded. We also record estimated reserves for product returns and credits at the time of sale and anticipated
uncollectible accounts.

**Shipping and Handling Costs**

Costs incurred for the transfer and delivery of goods to customers are recorded as a component of cost of sales.


-----

**Tax Collected from Customers**

Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, which are collected from customers, are excluded
from net sales.

**Research and Development**

Research and development costs, which consist primarily of employee related costs, are expensed as incurred, and were $27.9 million, $33.4 million and $32.2 million for the years ended
December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Costs incurred are recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses within the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Share-Based Compensation**

Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the requisite service period. See Note 17—Share-based
Compensation for further information.

**Restructuring and Exit Costs**

Our restructuring and exit activities are associated with a series of strategic initiatives aimed at maintaining a competitive cost structure, workforce optimization and further refinement of
our business model and our strategy of selling solutions to customers. Restructuring and exit charges incurred in connection with these activities consist of employee termination benefits
(one-time arrangements and benefits attributable to prior service), termination of contractual obligations, non-cash asset charges and other direct incremental costs. Restructuring and exit
charges are presented separately on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

**Transaction and Integration Costs**

Our transaction and integration costs consist primarily of professional and consulting services which are non-operational in nature. These costs relate to strategic initiatives, acquisitionrelated costs, and costs incurred in preparing to become a publicly traded company.

**Earnings (Loss) per Share**

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects
the potential dilution that could occur if commitments to issue ordinary shares were exercised or equity awards vested resulting in the issuance of ordinary shares that could share in the
earnings of the Company. See Note 21 - Earnings (Loss) Per Share for further information.

**Income Taxes**

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when
it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to
be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

We do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. Where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest
earnings of foreign subsidiaries, we provide for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings.


-----

We recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Additionally, we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision
(benefit) for taxes on income.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents**

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our policy is to invest cash in excess of short-term
operating and debt service requirements in cash equivalents. Cash equivalents are stated at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of the instruments. Our
policy is to transact with counterparties that are rated at least A- by Standard & Poor’s and A3 by Moody’s. Some of our operations are located in countries that are rated below A- or A3.
In this case, we try to minimize our risk by holding cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions with which we have existing global relationships whenever possible, diversifying
counterparty exposures and minimizing the amount held by each counterparty and within the country in total.

**Trade Receivables, Net**

In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers that satisfy pre-defined credit criteria. Trade receivables, which are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are net
of allowances for doubtful accounts. We maintain trade receivable allowances using an expected credit loss model, which uses a lifetime expected credit loss allowance for all trade and
lease receivables, resulting from the likelihood of failure of our customers to make required payments. To measure expected credit losses, trade and lease receivables are grouped based
on shared risk characteristics and the days past due. An additional allowance may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorate. We charge-off trade receivables after
all standard collection procedures have been applied without success.

**Inventories**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, as determined by the first-in, first-out method. Costs related to inventories include raw materials, direct labor and
manufacturing overhead which are included in cost of sales on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs such as idle facility expense, excessive scrap and re-handling costs are expensed as
incurred. We maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. These reserves are based
on management’s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog, forecasted demand, and market conditions that diminish the value of
existing inventories. If actual market conditions
deteriorate from those anticipated by management, additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required and may be material to earnings. See Note 6 - Financial
Statement Details for further information.

**Property and Equipment, Net**

We state property and equipment at cost, including the fair value of any asset retirement obligations upon initial recognition of the liability, except for the fair value of acquired property
and equipment that have been impaired, for which we reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value at the impairment date. We capitalize significant improvements and charge
repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets to expense as incurred. We depreciate the cost of property and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets:

**Asset Type** **Useful Life**
Building and building equipment 20-40 years
Machinery and equipment 5-10 years
Other property and equipment 2-10 years


-----

We remove the cost and accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise disposed of from the accounts and recognize any resulting gain or loss upon the disposition of the assets.
See Note 7 - Property and Equipment, Net for further information.

**Free on Loan Equipment**

We have sales arrangements in which certain equipment, an inventory item, is provided to customers for “free on loan” or at “no charge” on the condition that the customer purchases a
minimum amount of related consumables for use with the equipment. Providing equipment to customers in this manner is part of a sales strategy that ensures the long-term and continued
use by the end customer of our consumable products (e.g. chemical cleaning solutions). This practice is common in the markets we serve. Under these sales arrangements, we assign all
revenue to the delivery of consumables and the equipment is depreciated over the equipment’s useful life or the life of the customer program, whichever is shorter. For any equipment that
have been impaired, we reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value at the impairment date. The equipment is classified as part of other non-current assets on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 9 - Leases for further information.

**Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets**

Goodwill is initially assigned to reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets. Our goodwill
had a carrying value of $462.8 million and $471.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Diversey
trade name, had a carrying value of $818.2 million and $854.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

We review goodwill for possible impairment on a reporting unit level, which are consistent with our operating segments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on
an annual basis as of October 1st of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. Such events may include, but are not limited to, impairment of other assets or
establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, cash flow or operating losses at a reporting unit, negative current events or long-term outlooks for our industry, and negative
adjustments to future forecasts. In performing the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have the option under U.S. GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment that there are no indicators of impairment, we do not perform a
quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of October 1. U.S. GAAP provides a set of qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry, market and
company specific factors, including cost factors, overall financial performance, market capitalization, and other events specific to the Company to consider in performing the qualitative
assessment described above, which factors are not all inclusive; management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments.

If we conclude from our qualitative assessment that there are indicators of impairment and that a quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative goodwill impairment test
involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting
unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is
recognized in an amount of the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

Our annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one
level below an operating segment, which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time we change our operating segments. If the goodwill of
a reporting unit is allocated to newly-formed reporting units, the allocation is made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values.

Based on the results of our 2022 and 2021 annual qualitative assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its
carrying value. As such, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that our reporting units were not impaired.


-----

For our 2020 annual assessment, we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the quantitative test, which did not identify any impairment. As
of December 31, 2020, the estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value was greater than 20.0% of the fair value for both of our reporting units.

The fair value of our reporting units is determined using both an income approach, which is based on discounted cash flows (“DCF”), and a market approach when we quantitatively test
goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 of each year. Significant judgments inherent in using a DCF analysis include the selection of
appropriate discount and long-term growth rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on our
most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates and growth rates used in the DCF
analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate
and the long-term growth rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors, and
reflect our best estimate as of the impairment testing date. Any changes in such assumptions or estimates as a result of changes in our budgets, forecasts or negative macroeconomic
trends could significantly affect the value of our reporting units which could impact whether an impairment of goodwill has occurred. The discount rate used in the quantitative test for
determining the fair value of our reporting units was 9.0% in 2020. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions
and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to
estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use,
monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors.

If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. The 2022, 2021 and 2020 annual assessments
of the indefinite-lived intangible asset did not identify any impairments.

When performing a quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset using a relief from royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent
in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF
analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based
upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license our trade names. The future cash flows are based on our most recent forecast and budget and, for years
beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted revenue growth rates. Assumptions used in the relief from royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and
royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in our
annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment was 9.5% in 2022 and 9.0% in 2020, and the royalty rate used in 2022 and 2020 was 3.0%.

Based on the results of our 2021 annual qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded the
carrying value. As such, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that the indefinite-lived intangible asset was not impaired.

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible asset involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including
assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected
revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, or
other factors could negatively affect the fair value of our reporting units or the indefinite-lived intangible asset and result in a material impairment charge in the future.


-----

**Long-Lived Assets**

Long-lived assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, the aggregate amount of which was $1,513.7 million and $1,602.2 million, as of December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, respectively. Such long-lived assets primarily consist of definite-lived intangible assets in an aggregate amount of $1,165.9 million and $1,292.6 million as of
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

We perform an impairment review for definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and
equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Such events may include, but are not limited
to, a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, change in manner in which an asset is being used, significant change in business climate and significant cash flow
or operating losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of the asset. We calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows expected to result from the use
and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying value of the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount is found to be greater than
the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows of the asset or asset group, we record an impairment loss of the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset or asset group.
In addition, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate.

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives. The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these assets are fully
amortized, they are removed from the balance sheet. We evaluate these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these
assets may not be recoverable.

**Lessee Operating and Finance Leases**

We have various operating and finance lease agreements related to property, machinery, vehicles and other equipment. Our operating leases include vehicles, buildings, equipment,
material handling, storage and land. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the term.
The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes accrued lease expense resulting from the straight-line accounting under prior accounting methods, which is now being amortized over
the remaining life of the lease. Our finance leases relate to vehicles and equipment.

Our lease payments consist of fixed payments and variable payments. We determine our variable payments based on an index or a rate (i.e. CPI or a market interest rate) that is initially
measured at the commencement date. Fixed payments are both fixed and in-substance payments, less any lease incentives paid or payable. Some of our leases include options to extend
the lease, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to five years. If we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, the extension period is included as
part of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability.

Our leases do not contain residual value guarantees, which are guarantees made to the lessor that the value of an underlying asset returned to the lessor at the end of a lease will be at least
a specified amount.

Our leases do not contain restrictions or covenants that restrict us from incurring other financial obligations.

At the inception of our contracts we determine if the contract is or contains a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a
period of time in exchange for consideration. The discount rate for leases is determined based on the incremental borrowing rate ("IBR"). Our IBR is based on information available on
the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future payments.

For our leases, we have not elected to not apply the recognition requirements to leases of twelve months or less. These leases will be expensed on a straight-line basis and no operating
lease liability will be recorded.

We did not participate in lease transactions with related parties.


-----

**Lessor Operating and Sales-Type Leases**

We lease dosing and dispensing equipment to customers under operating and sales-type leases. Our accounting policy for these leases is to account for lease and non-lease components
separately. The non-lease components, such as product and service revenue, are accounted for under Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, see Note 4 - Revenue
Recognition for further information. Revenue from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Cost of sales from operating leases includes the
depreciation expense for assets under lease. The assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Revenue from sales-type leases is recognized as the present value of the future
lease payments in the period the lease agreement is signed and the equipment is delivered to the customer. Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method over the life
of the lease. Cost of sales from sales-type leases includes the cost for assets under lease. Initial lease terms range from one year to five years and most leases include renewal options.

Lease contracts convey the right for the customer to control the equipment for a period of time as defined by the contract.

Under our operating leases, there are no options for the customer to purchase the equipment and therefore the equipment remains the property of the Company at the end of the lease
term.

**Pension Benefits**

In connection with the Diversey Acquisition, we assumed certain defined benefit plan obligations and acquired certain related plan assets for current employees of our subsidiaries. In
addition, we implemented a replacement retiree health care reimbursement plan for certain U.S. based employees.

The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planby-plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected
rate of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of
providing retirement benefits.

In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible
employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data,
historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.
The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31.

In general, material changes to the principal assumptions could have a material impact on the costs and liabilities recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 13 Retirement Plans for further information.

**New Accounting Guidance**

We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed
and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial statements.


-----

**Recently Issued Accounting Standards**

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. The new
guidance is expected to improve the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient qualitative and quantitative
information about the program to allow a user of its financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential
magnitude. ASU No. 2022-04 is effective for us as of January 1, 2023 on a retrospective basis including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement to disclose
rollforward information, which is effective for us as of January 1, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We had no supplier finance programs during 2022, but anticipate implementing a
program in 2023. We do not believe that the adoption of ASU 2022-04 will have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements with the exception of expanded annual disclosures.

**NOTE 4 - REVENUE RECOGNITION**

We recognize revenue from contracts with customers under ASC 606 using the following five-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance
obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we
satisfy a performance obligation. Performance obligations are satisfied upon transfers of control of a good or service to a customer. We recognize revenue based on the expected amount
of consideration to be received for the provided goods or services, taking into account the expected value of variable consideration.

**Description of Revenue Generating Activities**

We provide high-performance cleaning, infection prevention and hygiene products for the food safety and service, food and beverage plant operations, healthcare, floor care,
housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care markets. In addition, we offer a wide range of value-added solutions, including food safety and application training and consulting, as
well as auditing of hygiene and water management. Many of our products are sold through distributors who then sell the product to end users.

**Identify Contract with Customer**

For an agreement to qualify as a contract under ASC 606, the agreement must create substantive enforceable rights and obligations. Indicators of enforceability for our contracts include,
but are not limited to, minimum purchase or spend obligations coupled with early termination penalties for the customer.

In the event a contract does not have a minimum purchase obligation nor contain any of the provisions to establish enforceable rights and obligations, part of the contract may still be
enforceable when a purchase order is issued and the purchase order relates to a section of the agreement. Most of our contracts do not contain minimum purchase obligations or early
termination penalties for the customer.

**Performance Obligations**

A performance obligation must include a promise to deliver goods or services whereby the good or service must be distinct in the contract. The most common examples of our distinct
performance obligations are consumables, training, equipment sales, installation, and maintenance. The other goods or services promised in the contract are not identified as performance
obligations when they are not separate, distinct, or material.

**Transaction Price and Variable Consideration**

Our contracts contain fixed and variable components. Our variable considerations include, but are not limited to, rebates, prebates, discounts, and returns. The amount of variable
consideration is estimated at contract inception by using the most likely amount method pending on the nature of the variable consideration. Such variable


-----

consideration is re-evaluated each reporting period, and accruals are booked based on the re-evaluated estimates and variable consideration recognized to date.

Charges for rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the associated revenue is recorded. When we estimate our
rebate accruals, we consider customer-specific contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and history of actual rebates paid. Our rebate accruals are reviewed at each reporting
period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. We adjust the accruals to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts. These adjustments impact the amount of
net sales recognized by us in the corresponding period of adjustment. Charges for rebates and other allowances were 25.9%, 25.0% and 25.8% of gross sales for the years ended
December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

**Allocation of Transaction Price**

We allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices. We obtain the transaction price of performance obligations by using the
selling prices for performance obligations with observable prices sold on a standalone basis. When observable prices are not readily available, we estimate the standalone selling prices by
using the expected cost plus a margin approach.

**Satisfaction of Performance Obligations**

The timing of revenue recognition depends on the nature of each performance obligation. In general, the time between when a performance obligation is satisfied and when billing and
payment occur is closely aligned, with the exception of revenue for services, which is satisfied over the life of the contract. The sale of goods is recorded at a point in time when the
customer obtains control of the asset. Transfer of control is indicated when we have a present right to payment for the goods, the customer has legal title to the asset, we have transferred
physical possession of the goods to the customer, the customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods, or the customer has accepted the goods. Revenue for
services, such as maintenance or training, that are performed over the life of a contract are recognized based on the activity we expect to undertake to fulfill the performance obligation.

**Disaggregated Revenue**

Revenues from contracts with customers summarized by region were as follows:

**Year Ended December 31,** **Year Ended December 31,** **Year Ended December 31,**

**(in millions)** **2022** **2021** **2020**

Europe $ 1,248.9 $ 1,153.1 $ 1,129.3

Non-Topic 606 Revenue (Leasing: Sales-type and Operating) 24.8 20.7 25.0

Total $ 2,765.9 $ 2,618.9 $ 2,629.2

**Contract Balances**

Timing differences occur when billing precedes or succeeds the satisfaction of the corresponding performance obligation. If the timing differences between billing and services
recognized over time is significant, we record a liability (unearned revenue) and do not recognize revenue until the performance obligation is satisfied. There were no material timing
differences that led to contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

**Assets Recognized For the Costs To Obtain A Contract**

In certain instances, we incur incremental direct costs of a transaction, such as prebates, equipment provided free on loan, or other related expenses in the contract negotiation phase.
Because these costs are likely incurred to transition to a new relationship or part of a negotiated renewal of a long-term relationship, these costs are considered costs to obtain a contract
and are deferred and amortized over the period in which revenue is recognized or the useful life of the equipment, provided that unamortized deferred costs are considered recoverable.
These amounts are recorded within Other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 6 - Financial Statement Details for further information.

**NOTE 5 - ACQUISITIONS**

We make business acquisitions that align with our strategic business objectives. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair
value as of their acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is based on estimates of the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration paid. Purchase
consideration is reduced by the amount of cash or cash equivalents acquired. Acquisitions during any of the years presented were not significant to our consolidated financial statements;
therefore, pro forma financial information is not presented. Costs incurred related to acquisitions are included as part of Transaction and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

**_2022 Activity_**

On January 24, 2022, we acquired Shorrock Trichem Ltd, a distributor of cleaning and hygiene solutions and services in the United Kingdom for the Institutional business segment.

acquisition related net assets decreased by $1.6 million, goodwill increased by $0.1 million, and we paid $1.5 million in additional consideration related to a net working capital
adjustment.

**_2021 Activity_**

On September 20, 2021 we acquired certain assets of Tasman Chemicals Pty. Limited, an Australian manufacturer of professional hygiene and cleaning solutions, and the results of

(1) The fair value of the intangible assets, which represents customer relationships and intellectual property, was determined using the Income Approach, which measures the value of an

intangible asset based on the present value of its future economic benefits. This approach converts future economic benefits to a single current amount by discounting the future
benefits at a rate of return sufficient to satisfy the risks and rewards associated with ownership of similar assets. This measurement reflects current market expectations regarding its
future economic benefits. The Income Approach is a non-recurring Level 3 fair value assessment.

**Factoring of trade receivables**

On October 25, 2021, we terminated our Master Agreement with Factofrance, S.A. (“Factofrance”) to sell certain trade receivables, without recourse, of eight Diversey companies
located in the United Kingdom, Spain, France, Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Italy and Portugal under individually executed Receivable Purchase Agreements (“RPAs”).

We accounted for transfers of receivables pursuant to the RPAs as a sale and removed them from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We maintained a “beneficial interest,” or a right to
collect cash, in the sold receivables in which we did not immediately collect cash. Cash receipts from the beneficial interests on sold receivables (which were cash

receipts on the underlying trade receivables that had already been sold in these agreements) are classified as investing activities and presented as cash receipts on sold receivables on our
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

We sold $495.5 million of receivables to Factofrance and received cash from Factofrance of $496.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. We collected from our customers
and remitted to Factofrance $524.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Securitization of trade receivables**

We sell certain North American and European customer receivables to PNC Bank ("PNC") without recourse on a revolving basis. This arrangement provides for maximum funding of up
to $150.0 million for receivables sold, which increased from $100.0 million during the second quarter of 2022. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into
the program. The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by a bankruptcy-remote wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which holds additional receivables in the amount of
$130.9 million as of December 31, 2022 that are pledged as collateral under this agreement.

Fees associated with the arrangement were $4.9 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

We transferred and derecognized $1,227.4 million of receivables and collected $1,172.3 million in connection with our arrangement with PNC during the year ended December 31, 2022.

We transferred and derecognized $669.7 million of receivables and collected $644.9 million in connection with our arrangement with PNC during the year ended December 31, 2021.

**Senior Secured Credit Facilities**

On September 29, 2021, we entered into an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which provided for a new $1,500.0 million senior secured U.S. dollar denominated term
loan (the “2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan”) in addition to the existing $450.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility,” and together with the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term
Loan, the “New Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan matures on September 29, 2028, while the Revolving Credit Facility matures on March 28, 2026.

The amendment provided for the repayment of the existing term loans in the aggregate amount of $1,404.2 million. In addition, we incurred a realized foreign currency exchange loss of
$4.5 million related to the refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities during the year ended December 31, 2021.

The interest rate under the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan is equal to (i) the Adjusted LIBOR rate (as defined in the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities), with a LIBOR floor of 0.50%,
plus 3.00%, or (ii) ABR (as defined in the

New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) plus 2.00%; however, such percentages per annum permanently stepped-down to 2.75% and 1.75%, respectively, during the first quarter of 2022, as
our Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities) was less than or equal to 4.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, the interest rate for the 2021 U.S.
Dollar Term Loan was 7.17%.

Deferred financing costs of $69.1 million related to the issuance of the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan are recorded as a reduction of the principal amount of the borrowings and are
amortized using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $24.0
million and $28.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In connection with the repayment of the term loans in 2021 discussed above, an additional
$12.8 million of deferred financing costs were charged to interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Original issue discount of $12.6 million related to the issuance of the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan is recorded as a reduction of the principal amount of the borrowings, and is amortized
using the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the 2021 U.S. Dollar Term Loan. The unamortized original issue discount balance was $7.0 million
and $8.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. In connection with the repayment of the existing term loans in 2021 discussed above, an additional $1.3
million of original issue discount was charged to interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Costs of $8.9 million related to entering into the Revolving Credit Facility are recorded as “Deferred financing costs” within Other current assets and Other non-current assets on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. Unamortized deferred financing costs related to the
Revolving Credit Facility were $2.7 million and $3.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

As of December 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $5.4 million of letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the available borrowing
capacity thereunder to approximately $444.6 million.

As of December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $7.9 million of letters of credit outstanding, which reduced the available borrowing
capacity thereunder to approximately $442.1 million.

The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain normal and customary affirmative and negative covenants. Some of the more restrictive covenants are (a) limitations on our ability to
pay dividends, (b) limitations on asset sales, and (c) limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. The New Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain various events of
default, the occurrence of which could result in the acceleration of all obligations. As of December 31, 2022, we were in full compliance with the provisions contained within the
covenants.

**2021 Senior Notes**

On September 29, 2021, we completed the sale of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2021 Senior Notes”) in a private placement to qualified
institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and to non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S) pursuant to
Regulation S under the Securities Act. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, together with borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities
and cash on hand, to redeem all of the €450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2017 Senior Notes”), pay fees and/or expenses incurred in
connection with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes. The 2021 Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2029, bear interest at 4.625%, and interest is
payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2022.

We redeemed the 2017 Senior Notes at the redemption price (expressed as percentages of principal amount) of 101.4%, for a total of $536.7 million, which consisted of $529.1 million of
principal amount and $7.6 million of redemption premium. The premium cost was charged to Loss on Extinguishment of Debt during the year ended December 31, 2021.


-----

Deferred financing costs related to the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes of $7.2 million are recorded as a reduction of the principal amount of the borrowings and are amortized using
the effective interest method as a component of interest expense over the life of the 2021 Senior Notes. In connection with the redemption of the 2017 Senior Notes, the balance of the
unamortized deferred financing costs related to the 2017 Senior Notes of $8.0 million was charged to Loss on Extinguishment of Debt during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Unamortized deferred financing costs were $6.1 million and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

We redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time prior to October 1, 2024, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes redeemed, plus
additional amounts, if any, a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

We may redeem the 2021 Senior Notes, in whole or in part, on or after October 1, 2024, at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) set forth in the indenture
governing the 2021 Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date:

**Year** **Percentage**
October 1, 2024 to September 30, 2025 102.313%
October 1, 2025 to September 30, 2026 101.156%
On or after October 1, 2026 100.000%

Additionally, at any time on or before October 1, 2024, we may elect to redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to
104.625% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, with the net cash proceeds received
from one or more equity offerings of the Company.
The indenture governing the 2021 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness, issue preferred equity and guarantee
indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain material debt; (iv) make loans
and investments; (v) sell or otherwise dispose of assets; (vi) sell stock of our subsidiaries; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements
restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

The 2021 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by a subsidiary of the Company, BCPE Diamond Netherlands TopCo
B.V., a private limited liability company (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid) incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands, and our existing and subsequently
acquired or organized direct and indirect material wholly owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities (other than those
organized in Italy).

**Short-term Borrowings**

Our short-term borrowings comprise primarily of bank overdrafts arising within our notional cash pooling system.

**Sale-Leaseback Transactions**

During March 2020, we completed sale-leaseback transactions under which it sold two properties to an unrelated third-party for a total of $22.9 million. Concurrent with this sale, we
entered into agreements to lease the properties back from the purchaser over initial lease terms of 15 years. The leases for the two properties include an initial term of 15 years
and four, five-year renewal options and provides for us to evaluate each property individually upon certain events during the life of the lease, including individual renewal options.

We classified the leases as a financing obligation to be paid over 15 years. The current and non-current portions are included in current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less
current portion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**NOTE 11 - DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES**

As a large global organization, we face exposure to market risks, such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. To manage the volatility relating to these
exposures, we enter into various derivative instruments from time to time under our risk management policies. We designate derivative instruments as hedges on a transactional basis to
support hedge accounting. The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying
exposures being hedged. We assess the initial and ongoing effectiveness of our hedging relationships in accordance with our policy. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. Our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures or is sold or terminated, or if we determine the underlying
forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring.

**Interest Rate Cap and Cross Currency Contracts Designated as Cash Flow or Fair Value Hedges**

In connection with entering into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and issuing the 2021 Senior Notes, we also entered into a U.S. dollar floating to Euro fixed interest rate swap, a
U.S. dollar interest rate cap, and a U.S. dollar to Euro currency swap, to manage the impacts of fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates on a portion of our floating-rate
and U.S. dollar denominated debt.

In 2022 we terminated several existing U.S. dollar floating to Euro fixed interest rate swaps and U.S. dollar to Euro currency swaps, receiving net proceeds of $186.1 million, and
simultaneously entered into new at-market swaps with the same notional amounts and maturity dates as the terminated swaps. We elected to classify the cash flows from the settlements
within financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to be consistent with the cash flows presentation of the hedged debt instruments.

As a result of these contract terminations, the net unrealized after-tax derivative gains included in accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") at the dates of termination are
being amortized against Interest expense, and the net unrealized after-tax derivative losses included in AOCI at the dates of termination are being amortized as Other (income) expense,
net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining lives of the derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2022, the unamortized gains in AOCI are $27.6 million and the
unamortized losses in AOCI are $7.9 million.

We record gains and losses on these derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax to the extent the hedges are effective and
until we recognize the underlying transactions in net income (loss), at which time we recognize these gains and losses in Other expense (income), net on our Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Net unrealized after-tax gain (loss) related to these contracts that were included in other comprehensive income was $71.0 million and $(2.9) million for the years ended December 31,
2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The unrealized amounts in other comprehensive income will fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts during each
reporting period.

We estimate that $35.2 million of net unrealized after-tax derivative gain included in AOCI will be reclassified into Other (income) expense, net, on the Consolidated Statement of
Operations within the next twelve months.

**Interest Rate Swap Contracts Not Designated as Hedges**

In connection with entering into the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and issuing the 2021 Senior Notes, we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap to offset the existing
floating to fixed interest rate swap, and the existing swap was also then de-designated as a cash flow hedge. As a result of the contract de-designation, the net unrealized after-tax
derivative loss included in AOCI at the date of de-designation is being amortized as Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the remaining life of the derivative
contract, and the unamortized loss in AOCI is $5.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Although the contracts are effective economic hedges, they are not designated as accounting hedges.
Therefore, changes in the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings.

**Foreign Currency Forward Contracts**

The primary purpose of our currency hedging activities is to manage the potential changes in value associated with the amounts receivable or payable on equipment and raw material
purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currencies. For those contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges, we
record gains and losses on other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax to the extent the hedges are effective and until we recognize the underlying transactions in net income (loss), at
which time we recognize these gains and losses in Other expense (income), net on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. For those contracts that are not designated as cash flow
hedges, the changes in the value of these derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings. These contracts generally have original maturities of less than 12 months.

**Effect of all Derivative Instruments on Income**

The following table details the (income) expense related to our derivative instruments, which are included in Other (income) expense on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
These amounts reduce the interest rate impact and transactional impact of foreign exchange, which is primarily the revaluation of our U.S. dollar denominated debt held at a Euro
functional entity, and the net impact is the Unrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss in Note 6 - Financial Statement Details.

**NOTE 12 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

**Fair Value Measurements**

In determining fair value of financial instruments, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent
possible and consider counterparty credit risk in our assessment of fair value. We determine the fair value of our financial instruments based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair
value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:

     - _Level 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to the reporting entity at the measurement date._

     - _Level 2 Inputs: Other than quoted prices included in Level 1 Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of_
the asset or liability.

     - _Level 3 Inputs: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations_
in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.

|Year Ended December 31, 2022|Year Ended December 31, 2021|Year Ended December 31, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|$ (0.5) (0.1) (0.1) (99.2)|$ (0.1) (0.2) (0.1) (29.4)|$ 0.5 (5.3) — —|
|$ (99.9)|$ (29.8)|$ (4.8)|


-----

The following table details the fair value hierarchy of our financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:


**December 31, 2022**


**(in millions)** **Total Fair Value** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**
Cash equivalents $ 116.3 $ 116.3 $ — $ —
Cross currency swaps, net liability $ (36.9) $ — $ (36.9) $ —
Interest rate caps, net asset $ 34.6 $ — $ 34.6 $ —
Foreign currency forward contracts, net liability $ (0.7) $ — $ (0.7) $ —
Interest rate swaps, net liability $ (5.0) $ — $ (5.0) $ —
Contingent consideration $ (0.2) $ — $ — $ (0.2)

**December 31, 2021**
**Total Fair Value** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3**
Cash equivalents $ 111.6 $ 111.6 $ — $ —
Cross currency swaps, net asset $ 32.6 $ — $ 32.6 $ —

Interest rate swaps, net liability $ (11.3) $ — $ (11.3) $ —
Contingent consideration $ (4.6) $ — $ — $ (4.6)

**Cash Equivalents**

Our cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits (Level 1) and money market funds (Level 1). Since these are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three
months or less at the date of purchase, they present negligible risk of changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates.

**Derivative Financial Instruments**

Our derivatives are recorded at fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which incorporates observable market inputs. These market inputs include foreign currency spot and
forward rates and LIBOR. These inputs are obtained from pricing data quoted by various banks, third party sources and foreign currency dealers involving identical or comparable
instruments (Level 2).

Counterparties to these derivative instruments are investment grade rated by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Credit ratings on some of our counterparties may change during the term of
our financial instruments. We closely monitor our counterparties’ credit ratings and, if necessary, will make any appropriate changes to our financial instruments. The fair value generally
reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date.

**Contingent Consideration**

We recorded contingent consideration related to earn-out provisions from our previous acquisitions. The fair values of such contingent consideration were derived using a discounted cash
flow model based on the projection of performance metrics, which are generally based on upon achieving certain revenue targets as outlined in the various provisions within the purchase
agreements and the probability of achieving the targets.

We remeasure amounts related to contingent consideration liabilities related to acquisitions that were carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements for
which a fair value measurement was

required. We recorded $0.2 million and $4.6 million in contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, for various acquisitions
occurring prior to 2017.

**Other Financial Instruments**

The following financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts that approximate fair value: (1) trade receivables, net, (2) certain other current assets, (3) accounts payable
and (4) other current liabilities. The carrying amounts reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above financial instruments closely approximate their fair value due to the
short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.

Other liabilities that are recorded at carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets include our debt. We utilize a market approach to calculate the fair value of our 2021 Senior
Notes. Due to the limited investor base and the face value of some of our 2021 Senior Notes, they may not be actively traded on the date we calculate their fair value. Therefore, we may
utilize prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving similar securities, reflecting U.S. Treasury yields to calculate the yield to maturity and the price
on some of our 2021 Senior Notes. These inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.

We derive our fair value estimates of our various other debt instruments by evaluating the nature and terms of each instrument, considering prevailing economic and market conditions,
and examining the cost of similar debt offered at the balance sheet date. We also incorporated our credit default swap rates and currency specific swap rates in the valuation of each debt
instrument, as applicable. These inputs are provided by an independent third party and are considered to be Level 2 inputs.

These estimates are subjective and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, and therefore we cannot determine them with precision. Changes in assumptions could
significantly affect our estimates.

The table below shows the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our debt, all of which are based on Level 2 inputs:

**December 31, 2022** **December 31, 2021**

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain
circumstances, such as acquisitions.

**Credit and Market Risk**

Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest or currency exchange rates. We
manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor
concentrations of credit risk.


-----

It is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 or higher by Moody’s. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our
exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit
downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels.

We regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and
currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative
purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We
consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to
significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our
sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

**NOTE 13 - RETIREMENT PLANS**

**Retirement Savings Plans**

We maintain qualified contributory retirement savings plans in which most of our U.S. employees are eligible to participate. The qualified contributory retirement savings plans generally
provide for contributions in cash based upon the amount contributed to the plans by the participants.

Retirement savings plans costs are charged to operations and totaled $1.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, respectively.

We have various international defined contribution benefit plans which cover certain employees. We have expanded use of these plans in select countries where they have been used to
supplement or replace defined benefit plans.

**Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans**

We maintain a retiree health care reimbursement plan for certain North American employees. The plan is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. In accordance with ASC Topic 715, the
amount of the accumulated benefit obligation on the initiation date is accounted for as prior service cost and is deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and
amortized over the period benefited.

The liability for these other long-term post-employment obligations was $1.7 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, and is included in
Other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

**Defined Benefit Pension Plans**

In connection with the Diversey Acquisition, we assumed certain defined benefit plans related to non-U.S. subsidiaries and retained certain plan assets associated with the assumed
obligations. All defined pension plan obligations for current and former employees in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom were retained by Sealed Air.

We recognize the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of the employee benefit
plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. Each over-funded plan is recognized as an asset and
each underfunded plan is recognized as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent changes in the funded status are reflected in unrecognized pension items, a component
of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amount of unamortized pension items is recorded


-----

net of tax. The measurement date used to determine the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets is December 31.

We have amortized actuarial gains or losses over the average future working lifetime (or remaining lifetime of inactive participants if there are no active participants). We have used the
corridor method, where the corridor is the greater of ten percent of the projected benefit obligation or fair value of assets at year end. If actuarial gains or losses do not exceed the
corridor, then there is no amortization of gain or loss.

**Obligations and Funded Status**

The following table sets forth the changes to the projected benefit obligations (“PBO”) and plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans. The measurement date used to determine
benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31 for all material plans.

The following table reflects the ABO for all defined benefit pension plans. Further, the table reflects the aggregate PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with PBO in
excess of plan assets and for pension plans with ABO in excess of plan assets.

**(in millions)** **December 31, 2022** **December 31, 2021**

ABO $ 401.9 $ 552.4

PBO $ 391.0 $ 539.5
ABO $ 379.5 $ 522.1
Fair value of plan assets $ 315.4 $ 409.8

The accumulated net actuarial gains (losses) for pensions and other post-employment benefits primarily relate to differences between the actual net periodic expense and the expected net
periodic expense from differences in significant assumptions, primarily including return on plan assets and discount rates used in these estimates.

**Estimated Future Benefit Payments**

The following table reflects the total benefit payments expected to be made for defined benefits:

**(in millions)** **Amount**
2023 $ 14.4
2024 $ 15.2
2025 $ 16.0
2026 $ 17.0
2027 $ 18.7
2028-2032 $ 112.6

**Actuarial Assumptions**

We determine our material assumptions for all plans on an annual basis as of December 31. Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations were as follows:

**December 31, 2022** **December 31, 2021**
Benefit obligations:

Discount rate 3.4 % 1.0 %
Rate of compensation increase 2.5 % 2.0 %
Pension increase rate 1.9 % 1.3 %

|$ 401.9|$ 552.4|
|---|---|


-----

Weighted average assumptions used to determine net period benefit cost were as follows:

**Year Ended December 31, 2022** **Year Ended December 31, 2021**
Benefit cost:

Discount rate 1.0 % 0.6 %
Expected long-term rate of return 4.3 % 4.5 %
Rate of compensation increase 2.0 % 1.9 %
Pension increase rate 1.3 % 1.4 %

The discount rates used reflect the expected future cash flow based on plan provisions, participant data as of the latest actuarial valuation and the currencies in which the expected future
cash flows will occur. For the majority of defined benefit pension obligations, we utilize prevailing long-term high quality corporate bond indices applicable to the respective country at
the measurement date. In countries where established corporate bond markets do not exist, we utilize other index movement and duration analysis to determine discount rates. The longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions reflect economic assumptions applicable to each country and assumptions related to the preliminary assessments regarding the type of
investments to be held by the respective plans.

**Plan Assets**

We review the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets annually, taking into consideration our asset allocation, historical returns, and the current economic environment. The
expected return on plan assets is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets at year end. To determine the expected return on plan assets, expected cash flows have been taken into
account.

Our long-term objectives for plan investments are to ensure that (a) there is an adequate level of assets to support benefit obligations to participants over the life of the plans, (b) there is
sufficient liquidity in plan assets to cover current benefit obligations, and (c) there is a high level of investment return consistent with a prudent level of investment risk. The investment
strategy is focused on a long-term total return in excess of a pure fixed income strategy with short-term volatility less than that of a pure equity strategy.

To accomplish this objective, we invest assets primarily in a diversified mix of equity and fixed income investments. Our targeted asset by category percentages are as follows:

Equity securities 32 %
Debt securities 48 %
Real estate 9 %
Other 11 %

Total 100 %

(1) Short-term investment fund that invests in a collective trust that holds short-term highly liquid investments with principal preservation and daily liquidity as its primary objectives.

Investments are primarily comprised of certificates, government securities, commercial paper and time deposits.

(2) Fixed income funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded government bonds and corporate bonds. There are no restrictions on these investments, and they are valued

at the net asset value at year end.

(3) Equity funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of publicly traded domestic and international common stock, with an emphasis in European securities. There are no restrictions on

these investments, and they are valued at the net asset value of the shares held at year end.

(4) The majority of these assets are invested in real estate funds and other alternative investments. Also includes insurance contracts, which consists of the Company and employee

contributions and accumulated interest income at guaranteed stated interest rates and provides for benefit payments and plan expenses.

The following table shows the activity of our plan assets, which are measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs:

**(in millions)** **Year Ended December 31, 2022** **Year Ended December 31, 2021**
Balance at beginning of period $ 42.5 $ 42.2

Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 0.1 0.1
Foreign exchange loss (2.6) (2.9)

Balance at end of period $ 36.6 $ 42.5

Level 3 pension assets are remeasured at least annually. Real estate properties, which are primarily located in Switzerland, are valued under the income approach using the discounted
cash flow method, by which the market value of the property is determined as the total of all projected future earnings discounted to the valuation date. Insurance contracts are valued
under the income approach using the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate and various assumptions used for the insurance contracts are consistent with the assumptions used
by the actuary to measure the pension benefit obligation.

For 2022, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit of $(35.2) million and the recorded income tax benefit of $(16.2) million was primarily attributable to a net $35.9 million
increase in the valuation allowance as a result of changes in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, offset by a net favorable change of $(25.1) million due to changes to
unrecognized tax benefits.

For 2021, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit of $(28.4) million and the recorded income tax provision of $25.3 million was primarily attributable to $15.6 million of
income tax expense related to non-deductible share-based compensation, and a net $23.8 million increase in the valuation allowance as a result of changes in the assessment of the
realizability of deferred tax assets.

For 2020, the difference in the statutory income tax benefit of $(7.3) million and the recorded income tax provision of $9.2 million was primarily attributable to $16.9 million of income

We have investments in various foreign subsidiaries. The unremitted earnings for investments in foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested, and we have
recognized a deferred tax liability related to those earnings. To the extent that there are outside basis differences beyond the unremitted earnings, we have not recognized a deferred tax
liability as we are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiaries. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred taxes that would apply in recovering the
outside basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries is impracticable due to the complexity of the calculations and the assumptions about the circumstances existing if and when
remittance occurs.

We have a U.S. federal net operating loss ("NOL") of $159.7 million (tax effected $33.5 million) which can be carried forward indefinitely. We also have U.S. state NOLs in the amount

such, a valuation allowance has been recorded. We have non-U.S. NOLs totaling $338.3 million (tax effected $84.7 million) which expire during various tax years, of which $8.8 million
(tax effected) is not expected to be realized as of December 31, 2022 and as such, a valuation allowance has been recorded.

We have $10.6 million of U.S. foreign tax credits, which expire in 2030, of which $7.9 million is not expected to be realized as of December 31, 2022 and as such, a valuation allowance

**Unrecognized Tax Benefits**

The following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits:

**Year Ended December** **Year Ended December** **Year Ended December**

**(in millions)** **31, 2022** **31, 2021** **31, 2020**

Balance at beginning of period $ 63.7 $ 60.1 $ 74.9
Gross increases - tax positions in current period — 2.5 —
Gross increases - tax positions in prior periods — 5.4 —
Decreases from settlements with tax authorities — — (13.2)
Lapse of statute of limitations (24.7) (4.3) (1.6)


Balance at end of period $ 39.0 $ 63.7 $ 60.1

The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $39.0 million, $63.7 million and $60.1 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively, of which, $25.2 million,
$46.3 million and $42.9 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.

We classified interest expense and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits in the consolidated financial statements as income tax expense. As of December 31, 2022
and 2021, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits totaled $4.6 million and $6.6 million, respectively.

Our U.S. federal income tax return is subject to examination for a period of three years after its filing date. The earliest year open is the tax year 2019. Income tax returns in non-U.S.
jurisdictions have statutes of limitations generally ranging from three to five years after their filing date. We are currently under examination in the Netherlands for 2017 and 2018. We
have various other non-U.S. tax returns in the process of examination but have largely concluded all other income tax matters for the years prior to 2012.

We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from the ongoing examinations. However the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with
certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes
in the period such resolutions occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits could
be reduced by up to $2.6 million in the next twelve months.

**Tax Receivable Agreement**

As part of the Reorganization Transactions, we entered into a tax receivable agreement (the “TRA”) with the pre-IPO owners of Constellation and certain other members of management
(the “TRA Recipients”). The TRA requires us to make payments to the TRA Recipients as part of the consideration for their shares in Constellation or as part consideration for the note
receivable held by them, as applicable, for 85% of the tax benefits realized by us when utilizing certain U.S. and Dutch income tax attributes generated, or owned by, or attributable to, us
on or prior to the date of the IPO, and any tax deductions available to us that relate to the transaction expenses incurred by us as a result of the consummation of the IPO. We expect to
utilize a significant portion of these income tax attributes based on current projections of taxable income, and therefore, expects to realize tax benefits. The annual tax benefits are
computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such tax benefits. Under the TRA, generally, we will retain the benefit of the
remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings. Our liability under the TRA on an undiscounted basis was $204.5 million and $238.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31,
2021, respectively, of which $1.6 million and zero is presented within Other Current Liabilities, and $202.9 million and $238.1 is presented within Other non-current liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.

The timing and amount of aggregate payments due under the TRA may vary based on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of the taxable income we and our subsidiaries
generate each year, the tax rate then applicable

|Year Ended December 31, 2022|Year Ended December 31, 2021|Year Ended December 31, 2020|
|---|---|---|
|$ 63.7 — — — (24.7)|$ 60.1 2.5 5.4 — (4.3)|$ 74.9 — — (13.2) (1.6)|
|$ 39.0|$ 63.7|$ 60.1|


-----

and the use of net operating losses. The payment obligations under the TRA are our obligations and are not obligations of Constellation. Payments are generally due within a specified
period of time following the filing of our annual tax return and interest on such payments will accrue from the original due date (without extensions) of the income tax return until the
date paid. Payments not made within the required period after the filing of the income tax return generally accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% (subject to a 50 bps LIBOR floor
and subject to change if LIBOR is no longer a widely recognized benchmark rate).

The TRA will remain in effect until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the TRA. The TRA will also terminate if we breach our
obligations under the TRA or upon certain mergers, asset sales, certain forms of business combinations, or other changes of control. If we exercise our right to terminate the TRA, or if
the TRA is terminated early in accordance with its terms, our payment obligations would be accelerated based upon certain assumptions, including the assumption that we would have
sufficient future taxable income to utilize such tax benefits.

**NOTE 15 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

At times, we are subject to governmental investigations and various legal actions and claims from governmental agencies and other parties. The outcomes of these matters are not within
our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. We record a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements for loss contingencies when a loss is known or
considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate
than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of
a loss to be recorded. Estimates of probable losses resulting from these matters are inherently difficult to predict. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters
should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows.

**Environmental Matters**

We are subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and we accrue for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an
assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is
reasonably possible that our liability in excess of the amounts that we have accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of
operations. Environmental liabilities are reassessed whenever circumstances become better defined or remediation efforts and their costs can be better estimated.

We evaluate these liabilities periodically based on available information, including the progress of remedial investigations at each site, the current status of discussions with regulatory
authorities regarding the methods and extent of remediation and the apportionment of costs among potentially responsible parties. As some of these issues are decided (the outcomes of
which are subject to uncertainties) or new sites are assessed and costs can be reasonably estimated, we adjust the recorded accruals, as necessary. We believe that these exposures are not
material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We believe that we have adequately reserved for all probable and estimable environmental exposures.

**Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations**

We are a party to many contracts containing guarantees and indemnification obligations. These contracts primarily consist of:

     - Product and service warranties with respect to certain products sold to customers in the ordinary course of business. These warranties typically provide that products will
conform to specifications. We generally do not establish a liability for product warranty based on a percentage of sales or other formulas. We accrue a warranty liability on a
transaction-specific basis depending on the


-----

individual facts and circumstances related to each sale. Both the liability and annual expense related to product warranties are immaterial to our consolidated financial
position and results of operations; and

     - Intellectual property warranties by us to third parties in which we have agreed to indemnify the licensee such third parties against infringement claims.

**NOTE 16 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

**Bain Capital**

On September 6, 2017, in conjunction with the Diversey Acquisition, we entered into a management agreement with Bain Capital, our previous sponsor. Pursuant to the management
agreement, we paid Bain Capital a fee for advisory, consulting and other services (the "Management Fee"), which was $7.5 million annually plus Bain Capital’s reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses. Upon closing of the IPO, the management agreement terminated pursuant to its terms, and we paid Bain Capital a lump sum amount of $17.5 million. During the years ended
December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $19.4 million and $7.5 million of Management Fee and termination fee expenses, respectively.

In addition to the Management Fee and prior to the termination of the management agreement, we paid consulting fees to Bain Capital for services related to future transactions or in
consideration of any additional services. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid Bain Capital $4.1 million, $2.3 million and $9.8 million, respectively, of
consulting fees.

There were no fees due to Bain at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.

We may conduct business with other Bain Capital affiliates from time to time in the normal course of business. Although we may have common owners with these affiliates depending
upon the Bain Capital fund ownership structure, we believe the terms were comparable to terms available or amounts that would be paid or received, as applicable, in an arm’s-length
transaction with a party unrelated to us.

**NOTE 17 - SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION**

On March 24, 2021, our Board adopted the 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan ("2021 Plan"), pursuant to which employees, consultants and directors of our Company and our affiliates
performing services for us, including our executive officers, are eligible to receive awards. The 2021 Plan provides for the grant of share options, share appreciation rights, restricted
shares, restricted share units, bonus shares, dividend equivalents, other share-based awards, substitute awards, annual incentive awards and performance awards intended to align the
interests of participants with those of our shareholders. We have reserved 15,000,000 Ordinary Shares (inclusive of issued and outstanding awards) for issuance under the 2021 Plan.

**Compensation Expense**

Share-based compensation expense related to equity and liability awards is included in the following line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

(1) During 2018, Constellation S.à r.l, a subsidiary of the Company, adopted a management equity incentive plan ("MEIP"), consisting of Class B through Class F shares ("MEIP Shares")

granted to certain domestic and foreign employees. Prior to the IPO, the value of the MEIP Shares was classified as a liability, and was remeasured at each reporting period. Upon
closing of the IPO and following the Reorganization Transactions, the MEIP Shares were converted into (i) vested ordinary shares which correspond to the value of MEIP Shares that
were vested as of the consummation of the IPO and (ii) restricted ordinary shares which correspond to the value of MEIP Shares that were unvested as of the consummation of the IPO.
The restricted ordinary shares will vest on the same terms and conditions as applied to the MEIP Shares to which they relate, and are not subject to performance conditions. The
conversion of MEIP shares and exchange for vested ordinary shares resulted in $68.1 million being reclassified from Non-current liabilities to Additional paid-in capital during the year
ended December 31, 2021. Future vesting of restricted ordinary shares will also be credited to Additional paid-in capital.

The unrecognized compensation expense as of December 31, 2022 related to nonvested equity awards and the weighted-average period they are expected to be recognized:

**Restricted Share Units**

Restricted Share Units ("RSUs") are accounted for using the fair value method, which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for awards based upon the grantdate fair value. RSUs are generally subject to service-based vesting or cliff vesting.

A summary of changes in outstanding nonvested RSUs is as follows:

**Weighted Average Grant Date**

Forfeited (142,277) 13.04

Nonvested at December 31, 2022 2,361,910 $ 13.10

**Performance Share Units**

A participant is eligible to become vested in a number of Performance Share Units ("PSUs") equal to a percentage, higher or lower, of the target number of PSUs granted based on the
level of our achievement of the performance condition. During 2022, we granted PSUs subject to the level of achievement of adjusted EBITDA growth and a total shareholder return
multiplier for the cumulative performance period of three years and the participant's continued employment with the Company. We are accounting for the grants as performance-based
awards, with a market condition, valued utilizing the Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based
on the most likely outcome. The grant-date fair value of the PSUs is based on the fair value of our common stock.

|Number of Awards|Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value|

**Share Options**

Share Options are accounted for using the fair value method, which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for awards based upon the grant-date fair value.
Share Options are generally subject to service-based vesting and remain exercisable for 10 years from the date of grant.

The fair value of the Share Options granted was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of the Company's stock
over the expected term of the stock options. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the United
States Treasury security with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date. Compensation expense for Share Options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
vesting period during which employees perform related services.

The table below presents the weighted average assumptions and related valuations for Share Options:

**Year Ended December 31, 2022**
Expected volatility 52.34 %

**_Awards Classified as Liabilities_**

**Long-Term Incentive Plan**

During 2018, certain employees were granted awards under a cash long-term incentive plan ("LTIP"). No vesting or payout occurred for the LTIP awards until the occurrence of an Exit
Event, as defined in the cash LTIP agreement. The closing of the IPO was an Exit Event. Upon an Exit Event requiring achievement of a specified performance target, the LTIP payout
amount would have been the sum of a Time-Based Payout and Performance-Based Payout, both as defined in the cash LTIP agreement. The value of the LTIP is classified as a liability.
Prior to the IPO, we determined it was not probable that the performance conditions would be met, therefore, no resulting compensation expense was recorded for any period prior to the
IPO.

**Cash-Settled Restricted Share Units**

Upon closing of the IPO, certain employees were granted cash-settled restricted stock unit awards based on the share price on the date of the IPO. These awards cliff-vest after three years
from the date of grant and will be settled in cash based on our share price on the vesting date. The value of the cash-settled restricted stock units is classified as a liability.

**NOTE 18 - RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES**

In 2021, we began a strategic initiative to consolidate certain manufacturing and warehousing facilities within Europe and North America, which also includes opening a new
manufacturing and warehousing facility in North America. We anticipate that these actions will both expand our production capacity and allow us to better manage our inventory, supply
chain and workforce. We expect to incur approximately $138.0 million of total costs related to this project, and charged $120.0 million over the life of the project and $111.9 million
during the year ended December 31, 2022. Costs incurred in 2022 of $27.1 million are reflected in restructuring and exit costs and $84.8 million of non-recurring other costs related to
facilities consolidations are reflected in Cost of sales. Our remaining costs for this project are approximately $18.5 million at December 31, 2022.

Cost estimates for these projects have been impacted by an inflationary macro environment with constraints around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary short-term measures were
taken to minimize disruption to customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily setting up additional warehouses, paying higher freight costs during
warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery.

In the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred restructuring costs related to a reduction in headcount to realign our personnel resources with our business needs, which was aimed at
maintaining a competitive cost structure and workforce optimization.

We also exited certain businesses in 2021 that leased equipment to customers under sales-type leases, as we further refine our business model and our strategy of selling solutions to
customers.

The following table details our restructuring and exit costs as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations:

**NOTE 20 - SEGMENTS**

Our operating segments, which are consistent with our reportable segments, reflect the structure of our internal organization, the method by which our resources are allocated and the
manner by which the chief operating decision maker assesses our performance. Our reportable segment structure includes two segments, Institutional and Food & Beverage.

Our segments are described as follows:

   - Institutional - Our Institutional products and services are designed to enhance cleanliness, safety, environmental sustainability, and efficiency for our customers. We offer a broad
range of products, solutions, equipment and machines including infection prevention and personal care, floor and building care chemicals, kitchen and mechanical warewash
chemicals and machines, dosing and dispensing equipment, and floor care machines. We deliver these solutions to customers in the healthcare, education, food service, retail and
grocery, hospitality, and building service contractors industries.

   - Food & Beverage - Our Food & Beverage products and services are designed to maximize the hygiene, safety, and efficiency of our customers’ production and cleaning
processes while minimizing their impact on the natural resources they consume. We offer a broad range of products, solutions, equipment and machines including chemical
products, engineering and equipment solutions, knowledge-based services, training through our Diversey Hygiene Academy, and water treatment. We deliver these solutions to
enhance food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability for customers in the brewing, beverage, dairy, processed foods, pharmaceutical, and agriculture industries.

No operating segments were aggregated to form our reportable segments. The reportable segments are the segments of the Company for which separate financial information is available
and for which segment results are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. We evaluate performance
of the reportable segments based on the results of each segment. The performance metric used by our chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance of our reportable segments
is Adjusted EBITDA. Certain amounts within segment Adjusted EBITDA for prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation, with no impact on
consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.

As described in Note 1 - General and Description of Business, our net sales are comprised of commercial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene products and solutions for food safety and
service, food and beverage plant operations, floor care, housekeeping and room care, laundry and hand care.

Net sales for our reportable segments is as follows:

the earliest period presented. Such retrospective presentation reflects an increase of approximately 47.4 million shares due to the exchange of shares in Constellation for shares in the
Company.

(2) For all periods presented, potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.
