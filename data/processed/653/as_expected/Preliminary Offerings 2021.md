The materials relating to the offering do not constitute, and may not be used in connection with, an offer or solicitation in any place where
offers or solicitations are not permitted by law. If a jurisdiction requires that the offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the

The offering memorandum is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments and
who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial

is directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or

No person may communicate or cause to be communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the

The offering memorandum has been sent to you in electronic form. You are reminded that documents transmitted via this medium may be

officers, employees or agents or affiliates of the foregoing entities or persons, accepts any liability or responsibility whatsoever in respect of
any difference between the offering memorandum distributed to you in electronic form and the hard copy version available to you on request
from the initial purchasers.

**Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not**
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is
one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a
customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;. Consequently no key information document required
by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. The offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that
any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as
amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. The offering memorandum is not a
prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

**EEA professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer,**
the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in the offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target
market for such Notes is persons satisfying the criteria of the definition of “eligible counterparties” or “professional clients” only, each as
defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to such persons are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering,
selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however,
a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting
or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**Prohibition of sales to UK retail investors: The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be**
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person
who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in
point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”).
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the
EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. The offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any
offer of Notes in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under the UK Prospectus Regulation and the FSMA from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. The offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK
Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

**UK professional investors and ECPs only target market: Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the**
target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and
(ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently
offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment;
however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for
undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM CONFIDENTIAL


###### Olympus Water US Holding Corporation
**$1,400,000,000 Senior Secured Notes due 2028, consisting of**
**$        % Senior Secured Notes due 2028**
**€        % Senior Secured Notes due 2028**
**$1,000,000,000 Senior Notes due 2029, consisting of**
**$        % Senior Notes due 2029**
**€** **% Senior Notes due 2029**
**The Issuer**

- Issuer: Olympus Water US Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), will issue the Notes (as defined herein) offered hereby. The Issuer
has no operating history and is controlled by affiliates of funds advised by Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (together with its affiliates, “Platinum” or the
“Sponsor”).


**The Offering:**

- The Issuer is offering $   aggregate principal amount of    % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Dollar Secured Notes”) and €   aggregate principal
amount of    % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro Secured Notes” and, together with the Dollar Secured Notes, the “Secured Notes”) and $
aggregate principal amount of     % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Dollar Unsecured Notes” and, together with the Dollar Secured Notes, the “Dollar Notes”)
and €   aggregate principal amount of     % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Euro Unsecured Notes” and, (i) together with the Dollar Unsecured Notes, the
“Unsecured Notes” and, together with the Secured Notes, the “Notes” and (ii) together with the Euro Secured Notes, the “Euro Notes”). The Notes are being
issued in connection with the pending acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of companies comprising the Solenis business (“Solenis”) and the Reorganization (as
defined herein), as more particularly described herein. See “The Transactions.”

- Unless otherwise indicated, references in this offering memorandum to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “its” refer to Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman
Islands exempted limited partnership, acting through its general partner, General Partner (as defined below) (“Parent”), the direct parent of the Issuer, and its
consolidated subsidiaries immediately following the Acquisition and the Reorganization, and will include certain subsidiaries of Innovative Water Care
Global Corporation (doing business as Sigura (“Sigura”)). See “The Transactions.”

- Use of Proceeds: The Issuer intends for the proceeds from this offering, together with the Equity Investment (as defined herein) and borrowings under the
New Credit Facilities (as defined herein), to be used as part of the financing for the Acquisition and the Reorganization, to fund the Refinancing (as defined
herein) and to pay fees, commissions and expenses related to the Transactions (as defined herein). See “Use of Proceeds.”


**Escrow:**

- We expect to close this offering concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization. It is, however, possible that the completion
of the Acquisition and the Reorganization may be delayed until after the issue date of the Notes (the “Issue Date”). In that case, unless the offering is settled
substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will, pending completion of the Acquisition, fund the gross proceeds of the offering into
separate escrow accounts, as more particularly described herein. The Issuer will not be subject to the restrictive covenants under the various debt instruments
governing the Sigura Existing Indebtedness and/or the Solenis Existing Indebtedness (each as defined herein).

- If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds from the sale of the Notes into separate escrow accounts for the benefit of the applicable Trustee (as defined herein) and the holders of the applicable
series of Notes. The release of the escrow proceeds will be subject to certain conditions set forth in the Escrow Agreement (as defined herein), including the
consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization. In the event that (i) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date (as defined
herein), (ii) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined herein) are deemed, in the Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (iii) at any time prior to the Acquisition Outside Date (as defined herein), the Acquisition
Agreement (as defined herein) is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each series of Notes will be subject to a
special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date,
to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. An affiliate of Platinum will agree, for the benefit of the applicable Trustee, the Escrow
Agent (as defined herein) and the holders of each series of Notes, (i) in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, to transfer an amount of cash to the Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the
holders of the Notes and (ii) upon receipt of a notice of a special mandatory redemption of the Notes from the Issuer, to transfer an amount of cash to the
Issuer that will be sufficient, after taking into account the escrowed funds at such time, to fund the redemption of all of the Notes, including accrued and
unpaid interest thereon and the fees and expenses of the applicable Trustee and the Escrow Agent. If this offering closes concurrently with the consummation
of the Acquisition and the Reorganization, the Notes will not be subject to the escrow provisions described in this offering memorandum. See “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory
Redemption.”

**The Notes:**

- Maturity: The Secured Notes will mature on      , 2028 and the Unsecured Notes will mature on      , 2029.

- Interest Payments: Each series of the Notes will pay interest semi-annually in cash in arrears on        and       of each year, beginning on     , 2022.

- Guarantees: Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization, the Notes will not be guaranteed. From and after satisfaction of the Escrow
Release Conditions and immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization (or on the Issue Date immediately following the
Acquisition and Reorganization if the Acquisition and Reorganization close concurrently with this offering), subject to certain exceptions, (i) the Unsecured
Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Parent and each of Parent’s existing and future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that are
guarantors under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined herein) (the “Subsidiary Guarantors” and, together with Parent, the “Guarantors”) and
(ii) the Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Guarantors. To the extent lenders under the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement release any Guarantor from its obligations, subject to certain exceptions, such Guarantor will also be released from its obligations under the Notes.
See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Brief Description of the Unsecured Notes—Unsecured Note Guarantees” and “Description of Secured Notes—Brief
Description of the Secured Notes—Secured Note Guarantees.”

- Security and Ranking: If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization, the Notes will initially be obligations
solely of the Issuer, secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and all deposits and investments therein. From and after
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions and immediately following the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization (or on the Issue Date
immediately following the Acquisition and Reorganization if the Acquisition and Reorganization close concurrently with this offering), the Unsecured Notes
and the related guarantees will be general, senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the
Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ subordinated indebtedness and equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ senior indebtedness,
without giving effect to collateral arrangements. The Unsecured Notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and
the Guarantors’ secured indebtedness, including the New Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes offered hereby, to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Parent’s subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors. From and after
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions and immediately following the Acquisition and the Reorganization (or on the Issue Date immediately following
the Acquisition and the Reorganization if the Acquisition and the Reorganization close concurrently with this offering), the Secured Notes and the related
guarantees will be general, senior secured obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors, secured on a first-priority basis by security interests in the Fixed Asset
Collateral (as defined herein) and on a second-priority basis in the Current Asset Collateral (as defined herein), in each case, subject to certain limitations and
permitted liens. The Secured Notes and the related guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ subordinated
indebtedness and be effectively senior to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ unsecured indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes offered hereby, and
indebtedness secured by liens junior to the liens securing the Secured Notes, including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility (as defined herein), in each case, to the extent of the value of the assets securing the Secured Notes. The Secured Notes and the related
guarantees will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ senior indebtedness, without giving effect to collateral
arrangements, and equal to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ senior indebtedness secured on the same priority basis as the Secured Notes, including the
New Term Loan Credit Agreement. The Secured Notes and the related guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’
indebtedness that is secured by assets that do not constitute collateral for the Secured Notes to the extent of the value of such assets, and indebtedness that is
secured by a senior-priority lien, including our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility to the extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral, and will be
structurally subordinated to the liabilities of Parent’s subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors.

- Optional Redemption: Each series of Notes may be redeemed on or after     , 2024 at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to     , 2024, each series of Notes may be redeemed at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the
redemption date, plus a “make-whole” premium applicable to the Notes. At any time prior to        2024, the Issuer may also redeem up to 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of each series of Notes using the proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption prices set forth in this offering
memorandum, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to
10% of the aggregate principal amount of each series of Secured Notes during each calendar year at a purchase price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal
amount of the Secured Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

- Change of Control: If we undergo a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer is required to offer to purchase each series of Notes from
holders at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but
excluding, the date of repurchase. In connection with any offer to purchase any series of Notes, if holders of no less than 90% of the aggregate principal
amount of such series of Notes validly tender their Notes, the Issuer is entitled to redeem any remaining Notes of such series at the price offered to each
holder.

- Redemption for Taxation Reasons: In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuer may elect to redeem all, but not less than all, of the
relevant series of Notes. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Redemption for Taxation Reasons” and “Description of Secured Notes—Redemption for
Taxation Reasons.”

- Each series of Notes is a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for any series of Notes. This offering memorandum
includes additional information on the terms of the Notes, including redemption and repurchase prices, covenants and transfer restrictions. See “Description
of Unsecured Notes” and “Description of Secured Notes.”

**Investing in the Notes involves risks that are described in the “Risk Factors” section beginning on page 45.**

**Offering Price of the Dollar Secured Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2021.**
**Offering Price of the Euro Secured Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2021.**
**Offering Price of the Dollar Unsecured Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2021.**
**Offering Price of the Euro Unsecured Notes:      % plus accrued interest, if any, from       , 2021.**

The Notes and the guarantees thereof have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or
any other securities law. The Issuer is not required to and does not intend to register the Notes for resale under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdictions, and the Issuer is not required to offer to exchange the Notes for notes registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to U.S. persons, except to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional
buyers in reliance on an exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions
outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Issuer and the initial purchasers named below are offering the Notes only to


-----

persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in
reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. For further details about eligible offerees and resale restrictions, see “Transfer Restrictions.”

There is currently no public market for the Notes. The Dollar Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. The
Issuer intends to apply to list each series of Euro Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) following the consummation of
this offering. The listing application will be subject to approval by The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”). The Exchange is not a
regulated market for the purposes of EU Directive 2004/39/EC. There is no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange,
and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is
not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

The Issuer expects that the Dollar Notes will be ready for delivery in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and the Euro
Notes will be ready for delivery in book-entry form through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking S.A. (“Clearstream”), in each case, on
or about      , 2021, which is the     business day following the date of confirmation of orders with respect to the Notes and the date of this offering
memorandum (such settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). See “Plan of Distribution.”

**NOTICE TO INVESTORS**

We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for
offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except
pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act
and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering
memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any
of the Notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all
applicable laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or
permission required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the
jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial
purchasers will have any responsibility therefor.

By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties
and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial
purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted.
You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite
period of time.

This offering memorandum summarizes documents and other information in a manner we believe to be
accurate, but we refer you to the actual documents for a more complete understanding of the information we discuss
in this offering memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of such
documents, our business and the terms of the offering and the Notes, including the merits and risks involved.

The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information set forth in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this offering
memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future.

The initial purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and no one else in connection with the offering
contemplated by this offering memorandum. They will not regard any other person (whether or not a recipient of
this offering memorandum) as their client in relation to the offering of securities contemplated by this offering
memorandum and will not be responsible to anyone for providing the protections afforded to a client nor for giving
advice in relation to the offering or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein.

This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to persons reasonably believed to
be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act for informational use solely in
connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) in offshore transactions outside the United
States complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Its use for any other purpose
is not authorized. This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only
be distributed and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided by us or by the initial purchasers.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II;. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. This offering
memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made
pursuant to an exemption under the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each manufacturer, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes described in this offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market
for such Notes is persons satisfying the criteria of the definition of “eligible counterparties” or “professional clients”
only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to such persons are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take
into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is
responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of such Notes (by either adopting or refining
the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended,
the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act
2000 (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97,
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation
(EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK MiFIR”). Consequently no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs
Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United
Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, as it forms part of UK domestic
law by virtue of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) and the FSMA from the requirement to
publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the
UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties,
as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK
MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

The above selling restrictions are in addition to any other selling restrictions set out in this offering
memorandum.

By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an
opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the
accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on
the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the
accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that
is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to
make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering memorandum, other
than as contained in this offering memorandum, and in information given by our duly authorized officers and
employees in connection with an investor’s examination of us and the terms of the offering of the Notes.

We and the initial purchasers make no representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you.
You should not consider any information included in this offering memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice.
You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding
an investment in the Notes. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor any sale made pursuant to this
offering memorandum implies that any information set forth in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date
after the date of this offering memorandum.

iii


-----

You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional
information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum.

We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also
reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason, to sell less than the
entire principal amount of the Notes offered in this offering memorandum and to allot to any prospective investor
less than the full amount of Notes sought by such investor. We are making this offering of the Notes subject to the
terms described in this offering memorandum and the Indentures, as applicable.

Each series of Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that each series of Notes sold
pursuant to this offering memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates. The global
certificates will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of, with respect to the Euro Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream and, with respect to the
Dollar Notes, DTC. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global
certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their direct
and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Notes in certificated form will be issued
in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the Indentures. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.”

We do not intend to apply for listing of the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the
Dollar Notes in any automated dealer quotation system. We intend to apply to list each series of Euro Notes on the
Exchange after the issue date of such Euro Notes. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro
Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Euro Notes is not conditioned on the Issuer making
an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. Neither the admission of the Euro Notes to be listed
on the Exchange, nor the approval of this offering memorandum pursuant to the listing requirements of the
Authority shall constitute a warranty or representation by the Authority as to the competence of the service providers
to, or any other party connected with, the Issuer, the adequacy of information contained in this offering
memorandum or the suitability of the Issuer for investment or any other purposes.

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that
stabilize or maintain the market price of each series of Notes at a higher level than each series of Notes might
otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a
description of these activities, see the section entitled “Plan of Distribution” in this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum is strictly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection
with the proposed offering of the Notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is
personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for
or otherwise acquire the Notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and
those persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect to this offering memorandum is unauthorized and
any disclosure of any of its contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this
offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this
offering memorandum or any documents delivered in connection with this offering memorandum.

This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents related to this offering, will not be reviewed or
approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Notes and related guarantees
described in this offering memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the SEC or
any other federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such
federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this
offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. There are no registration rights
associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer Notes registered under the Securities Act in exchange
for the Notes offered in this offering or to file a registration statement with respect to the Notes. The Indentures will
not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”).

**CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS**

This offering memorandum includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans,
objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed
to be, “forward-looking statements.” These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “seeks,”
“projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “may,” “will,” or “should” or, in each case, their negative or other variations or
comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They
appear in a number of places throughout this offering memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions,
beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition,
liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the industry in which we operate.

Statements contained in this offering memorandum that are not purely historical are forward-looking
statements and may include, but are not limited to, management’s expectations of competition; market share;
revenues, margin, expenses and other operating results and ratios; economic conditions; vendor terms and
conditions; pricing strategies; customer terms and conditions; organizational changes and related restructuring,

operating models; exchange rate fluctuations and related currency gains or losses; resolution of contingencies; our
competitive advantages; seasonality; interest rates and expenses; and rates of return, as well as other statements
regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategy.

By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events
and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties
include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum. Those
factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this
offering memorandum. Among the risks and uncertainties that may significantly impact us are, without limitation,
risks associated with:

  - failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles;

  - failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues;

  - changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the countries in
which we operate;

  - conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors, such as inflation,
deflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as
regulatory requirements;

  - fluctuations in our industry that could adversely affect our end market customers;

  - impact of business disruptions, including supply chain disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause,
including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters;

  - successful integration of acquired businesses;

  - liquidity of Ashland (as defined below) from which we have significant indemnification assets;

  - fluctuations in interest (LIBOR, EURIBOR or other applicable reference rates) rates which may affect
service costs on our external debt;

v

  - acquisitions and divestitures of our competitors;

  - our ability to successfully consummate the Acquisition and the Reorganization and, as a result, our ability
to successfully issue the Notes offered hereby;

  - the incurrence of substantial transaction related costs in connection with the Transactions;

  - the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic;

  - raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as related costs;

  - the competition our products and services face and our ability to adapt to industry and market changes;

  - the consolidation of customers;

  - current and potential litigation involving us;

  - malfunction or intentional hacking of our technological systems;

  - compliance with privacy laws and adequate protection of personal data;

  - our ability to retain and attract qualified employees and key personnel;

  - our financing efforts;

  - our ownership structure, including the Issuer not controlling the acquired business until the completion of
the Acquisition;

  - the effect of the pendency of the Acquisition, including on our ability to retain key personnel and on our
business relationships, operating results and business generally; and

  - the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted related to the Acquisition.

Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when
made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual
results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the
development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those described in or suggested by the
forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations,
financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the development of the
industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering
memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.

Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this offering memorandum speak only as of the date of
those statements, and we undertake no obligation to update those statements or to publicly announce the results of
any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current
and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless
expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data.

**USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES**

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following
non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA, Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash
flows. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our
financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our
operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our
core business. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our
performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Segment profit as the primary measure of our segment
specific performance. The following terms have the following meanings:

  - “Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to (i) for Solenis, the impact of realized
and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, severance payments associated with restructuring, non-cash
expense for equity compensation plans, financing expenses, non-service costs for pensions and other nonoperational items, fees paid to Solenis’ current shareholders and merger related costs, integration, other
non-recurring items, incentive compensation above 1.0x of the applicable target, one-time income related
to the clawback of bonuses realized in 2021, non-cash gains on an asset disposal and pre-acquisition
EBITDA for the acquisitions by Solenis of Chemsystems Pulp and Paper business, Poliquimicos, S.A. de
C.V. and MFG Chemicals and, in prior periods, adjustments related to the JV and, (ii) for Sigura, the
impact of non-operating income/expense, including Sigura’s gain on the sale of Surface Water in October
2020, fees paid to Platinum, one-time consulting and transaction costs related to the separation from its
previous owners, as well as other non-recurring and unusual costs, one-time consulting and other costs
related to implementation of operational improvement plans, severance payments associated with
restructuring, unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, the disposal of a fixed asset and the divestiture of
its Surface Water segment and Argentina business.

  - “Adjusted net operating cash flows” and “Adjusted net investing cash flows” means, for Solenis, reported
net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities,
each adjusted for the effects of cash subsequently received as part of our Existing Accounts Receivable
Financing (as defined below).

  - “EBITDA” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization
(including amortization of pre-publication investment cash costs).

  - “Pro Forma Combined EBITDA” means EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions.

  - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the
Transactions.

  - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies)” means Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the unaudited pro forma combined impact for certain estimated
run-rate annual cost synergies from actions expected to be taken within 18 months of the closing of the
Transactions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and Reorganization—We may not
achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA
(After Synergies).”

  - “Segment profit” means, for Solenis, EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the
impact of certain non-cash, non-recurring or other items that are included in net (loss) and EBITDA that we
do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and (iii) certain unusual or non-recurring
items impacting results in a particular period.

vii


-----

We believe the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net
operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate
our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro
Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA
(After Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows may
vary from that of other competitors in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives
to income before income taxes, net (loss), or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S.
GAAP as measures of operating performance. See “Summary—Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations of Solenis—Non-GAAP Financial Metrics—Reconciliation of Net (Loss) to EBITDA and Segment
Profit.”

With respect to Adjusted net operating cash flows and Adjusted net investing cash flows, Accounting
Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-15 requires us to evaluate the transfer of title of receivables sold under our Existing
Accounts Receivable Financing against cash received on previously-sold receivables in exchange for the transfer of
title. Since there is a dichotomy between when we legally transfer title of receivables to ING Luxembourg S.A. or
MUFG Bank, Ltd under the current receivables purchasing agreements and when the cash received on previouslysold receivables, receivables are deemed transferred in exchange for a beneficial interest in the collection of that
receivable. This is considered a non-cash investing activity. Furthermore, ultimate receipts of cash, when settled
with ING Luxembourg or MUFG Bank, Ltd., are considered cash flows from investing activities, as the receipt is
considered a return of capital on the beneficial interest.

We believe that this may cause net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and net cash provided by
(used in) investing activities to be potentially misleading to investors. While Solenis does not retain legal ownership
of the receivables sold, the nature, timing, and extent of cash flows have not materially changed as a result of the
agreement. We use these non-GAAP metrics to assess our own liquidity.

The adjustments reflected in our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA
and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies) have not been prepared with a view towards
complying with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies) is
intended to provide additional information on a more comparable basis than would be if provided without such
adjustments because they account for initiatives related to back office, sales and support staff optimization,
warehouse and temporary labor efficiency and technology, among others.

The non-GAAP measures noted above are the primary indicators that we use internally to conduct and
measure our business and evaluate the performance of our consolidated operations. We believe these non-GAAP
financial measures are useful because they provide meaningful comparisons to prior periods. These non-GAAP
financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with
GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that,
when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial
measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. A material limitation
associated with these non-GAAP measures as compared to the GAAP measures is that they may not be comparable
to other companies with similarly titled measures that present related measures differently. The non-GAAP
measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the corresponding
measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The Indentures governing the Notes and the New Credit Agreements include definitions of EBITDA-based
metrics that are different from the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies) used herein.
EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies) should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or
superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate
each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating EBITDA,
Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses

viii


-----

similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
Synergies) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items.

The non-GAAP metrics do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to
meet our cash requirements and may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor are such measures
meant to be predictive of our future results. Our non-GAAP metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you
should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are:

  - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual
commitments;

  - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;

  - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or
principal payments on our debts;

  - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized
will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
Synergies) do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements;

  - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After Synergies) reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and

  - other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, or Adjusted net investing cash flows
differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies),
Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows along with other
comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance.
Such U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, and net (loss) amongst other performance
metrics. In evaluating these financial measures, one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses
similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of such measures should not be construed as an
inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted herein to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies). However, the
magnitude of such adjustments for the periods noted below is not necessarily indicative of the magnitude of such
adjustments in future periods.

See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data” for a reconciliation of these
measures to our directly comparable GAAP measures.

Because the leverage ratios presented in this offering memorandum are based, in part, on Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies),
these measures are similarly impacted by the limitations referenced above and also should not be considered in
isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures.

**MARKET AND OTHER DATA**

Throughout this offering memorandum, we refer to our market position or market share in various markets

statistical information obtained from independent industry publications, reports by market research firms or other
published sources, as further specified below. Certain market and industry data included in this offering
memorandum, including the size of certain markets, are based on estimates or beliefs of our management. These
estimates or beliefs have been derived from or based on our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets
in which we operate, as well as information obtained from surveys, reports by market research firms, our customers,

We confirm that the information in this offering memorandum that is based on statistical information from
independent industry publications, reports by market research firms or other published sources has been accurately

inaccurate or misleading. Such sources and other industry publications, reports and other published data generally
state that the information contained therein has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but we cannot
assure you that the information contained in these reports, and therefore the information contained in this offering
memorandum that is derived therefrom, is accurate or complete. This information may prove to be inaccurate
because of the method by which we obtain some of the data for our estimates or because this information cannot
always be verified with complete certainty due to the limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the
voluntary nature of the data gathering process and other limitations and uncertainties. As a result, although we
believe these sources are reliable and we are not aware of any misstatements regarding our industry data included
herein, neither we nor the initial purchasers have independently verified the information and cannot guarantee its
accuracy and completeness.

**BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

The consolidated financial statements of Solenis UK International as of and for each of the years ended
September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 have been prepared in accordance U.S. GAAP, and include the financial
statements of Solenis UK International and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

The consolidated and combined financial statements of Innovative Water Care Global Corporation, doing
business as Sigura, as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 have also been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and include the financial statements of Innovative Water Care Global
Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Historically, the combined and consolidated financial statements of the Solenis business were presented at
the level of Solenis International, L.P., a Dutch limited partnership. In January 2019, in conjunction with the
acquisition of BASF SE’s paper and water chemicals business, the ownership interests in Solenis International
L.L.C. (formerly a limited partnership known as Solenis International L.P.) transferred to Solenis UK International,
and the business’s combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2019 partially
restated the consolidated statement of operations, the consolidated balance sheet and the consolidated statement of
cash flows as of and for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 to reflect the change in reporting entity for
comparability purposes.

It is not anticipated that either Solenis UK International or Solenis UK Holdings Ltd will be acquired as
part of the Acquisition. Neither Solenis UK International nor Solenis UK Holdings Ltd have any business operations
or assets, other than certain cash and cash equivalents, intercompany loan balances and investments in the ownership
interests of the Sellers. All such intercompany balances and transactions will be eliminated as part of the
rationalization prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and Reorganization. See “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information—Note 3(c).”

Due to the impact of the acquisition by Platinum and certain of its affiliates of Sigura on February 28, 2019,
Sigura’s consolidated and combined financial statements and certain note presentations for the year ended December
31, 2019, are presented in two distinct periods to indicate the application of a different basis of accounting between
the periods presented: (1) the period up to and including the acquisition date (January 1, 2019 through February 28,
2019, labeled Predecessor) and (2) the period after that date (March 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, labeled
Successor).

**Company Overview**

**_Solenis_**

Founded in 1907 and headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, Solenis is a leading manufacturer and
distributor of specialty chemicals and solutions for consumer and industrial water intensive industries, including the
pulp, packaging paper and board, tissue and towel, oil and gas, petroleum refining, chemical processing, mining,

chemistries, process aids, functional additives as well as state-of-the-art monitoring and control systems. These

(including 1,600 field representatives with deep industry knowledge) in 120 countries across five continents. Solenis
has nine labs consisting of R&D centers and Customer Applications Laboratories spanning every region it serves,
aimed at making water work more effectively and more sustainably for its more than 11,000 customers. Key brands
include Zetag™, Kymene™, Hercobond™, Spectrum™, Praestol™, PerForm™ and Percol™.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Solenis generated Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of $2.86
billion and $485 million, respectively, reflecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17%. See “—Summary Historical
Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data.”

**_Sigura_**

Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Sigura (Innovative Water Care Global Corporation, doing business
as Sigura) is a leading supplier of sanitizers and other water treatment solutions featuring top consumer brands in

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, Sigura generated Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of $625
million and $88 million, respectively, reflecting a 14% Adjusted EBITDA margin. See “—Summary Historical
Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data.”

**Combined Company Overview**

We believe that the combination of Solenis and Sigura will create a global market leader across all water
intensive industries. We believe that we will be well-positioned to benefit from growing Environmental, Social and
Governance (“ESG”) and macroeconomic mega trends, including around customer sustainability goals and focus
points, such as: water recycle and energy and raw material management, consumer focus on hygiene, environmental
legislation globally, increased levels of shipping and packaging, among others. Together, we will offer a diverse,
comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, which will limit any obsolescence risk as no product or solution
represents a material part of our business. Our cutting edge technology is at the forefront of the digitization of the
water treatment industry and we have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products that drive significant value
for our customers. We will operate across a diverse set of growing end markets and our broad geographic reach
allows us to meet the needs of our customers globally. Our footprint spans six continents, with both laboratories and
production facilities across North America, LatAm, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve all major developed
markets and are closely integrated with our customers throughout the world. Through our global presence and
differentiated service offering in growing markets, we believe we will be an industry leader in all of our segments.

The following graphic summarizes the geographic reach of laboratories and production facilities of the
combined Solenis company following the Transactions.

We believe our business exhibits highly attractive financial characteristics, including significant recurring
revenues, improving margin profile and substantial free cash flow conversion. The combined Solenis company will
provide greater scale to capture tailwinds from growing end markets. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021,
we generated pro forma Net sales and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies) of $3,491 million
and $613 million, inclusive of $40 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions taken within 18
months of the closing of the Transactions, respectively. We believe our combined earnings profile will generate
significant free cash flow, which we expect will be used to support growth initiatives and drive de-leveraging.

We believe the Transactions create an opportunity to realize meaningful synergies resulting from the
integration of Solenis and Sigura in addition to standalone cost savings at Solenis from management plans already
underway. We expect to realize approximately $40 million of synergies from integration related to the consolidation
of support functions and sales teams, sourcing of direct materials, and consolidation of facilities between the two
businesses, from actions taken within 18 months of the closing of the Transactions. Additionally, Solenis, along with
Platinum, has identified approximately $72 million in annual run-rate cost savings related to raw material sourcing
capabilities at Solenis, pricing and mix optimization, shared service and indirect spend optimization, and 4-wall
improvement on controllable costs at existing facilities from additional actions taken within four years of the
Transactions closing. We believe the total synergy and cost savings plan represents an approximately $113 million
opportunity based on actions implemented over the first four years from the closing of the Transactions. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these synergies or operational improvements. For more

Soda (2%), Epichlorohydrin (2%), and Adipic Acid (2%), resulting in total expenditure in the top five materials of
15% or $203 million. The top five key suppliers represent 36% of total expenditure, or $498 million, with the top
two representing 27% of total expenditure.

The following graphic summarizes our expenditure on raw materials and to key suppliers for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021.

**Industry Overview**

**_Specialty Chemicals – Consumer_**

The consumer market is comprised of water treatment chemicals and solutions for pulp and paper specific
process applications (e.g., strength additives and sizing agents across wet-end/dry-end of paper process). Based on a
report by a third party expert advisor completed in June 2021, the global consumer market was estimated to be
approximately $8 billion in 2020.

The Packaging market is one of the key market segments within the consumer market that can be broken
into consumer packaging and food packaging. Based on the same report, the consumer packaging market was
estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 3.4% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030,
which we believe will be driven primarily from the growth of e-commerce and megatrends in pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics and beauty. Approximately 18% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021
was generated from the consumer packaging market. Based on the same report, the food packaging market was
estimated to be $1.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030,
driven by increased demand for ecofriendly packaging and changing lifestyles centering on more take-away and
individually packed food. We believe the shift away from plastic and the growth in the barrier coating market, which
is not included in the market size estimate, may drive additional growth in food packaging over this period.
Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was generated from the
food packaging market.

The Graphic & Specialty Paper market has been adversely impacted by the continued substitution of
printed material with electronic media. Reduced use of commercial office spaces in Europe and North America as a
result of COVID-19 is also a negative factor for the sector outlook. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market, based on
the same report, was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to decline at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year
from 2020 to 2030. However, we have limited exposure to newsprint, which accounts for less than 2% of Consumer
Solutions sales, and we are shifting our focus to higher margin products to offset the expected volume decline in this
market. Approximately 11% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was generated
from the Graphic & Specialty Paper market.

The Tissue & Towel market is benefiting from strong demographic/socioeconomic trends and increasing
hygiene standards, especially in developing markets. However, stagnating population growth in some mature
markets, and cost-cutting in the public sector and private company spending is expected to limit global market

growth. The Tissue & Towel market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2020 and is
expected to grow at a 2.6% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030. Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net
sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was generated from the Tissue & Towel market.

**_Specialty Chemicals — Industrial_**

The industrial market supplies water treatment chemicals and solutions for heavy and light industries and
municipalities (e.g., cooling tower, boiler, influent/effluent, process water). Broadly speaking, the industrial market
consists of core water treatment which includes end markets such as pulp, mining and oil and gas, and wastewater,
which includes end markets such as municipal and industrial wastewater markets.

Based on the same report, the global industrial market was estimated to be approximately $23 billion in
2020 and is expected to grow at a 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025. The municipal market is
expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report, as demand
continues to increase from higher per capita usage of water, population growth and increasing regulatory demands.
The core water treatment market growth is expected to be driven by increasing sustainability and environmental
policies, growing regulatory demands and global industrial growth. This growth is expected to be highest in the food
and beverage market (5.5% CAGR for the five year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report) and the
refining and petrochemicals market (4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same
report).

**_Pool_**

The aftermarket for the residential pool industry is comprised of three main segments: (1) Chemicals, (2)
Equipment, Parts, and Accessories and (3) Services. Our main focus is on the Chemicals segment which is the
largest and most stable component of aftermarket pool spend.

Pool chemicals sales are tied to: (1) the pool installed base and (2) total gallons of treatable water, and not
new builds. The U.S pool installed base has displayed long-term stability as it has consistently grown for decades,
including all years through the housing-led recession and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is
providing current tailwinds for the business. However, new builds account for less than 4% of the installed base
annually, meaning that new build rates are unlikely to materially impact our long-term performance.

The Pool Solutions segment also benefits from a stable aftermarket spend that mirrors the steady dynamic
of the installed base. Our chemical-based products result in 100% aftermarket exposure, which reduces our exposure
to cyclical industry trends such as housing starts. Pool chemical use is entirely non-discretionary in that it is a
requirement for owning and using a pool. Pool owners who have already made the significant upfront investment of
constructing a pool, estimated to cost $40,000 to $100,000, will continue to purchase pool chemicals, at the de
minimis annual expense of only $300 to $400 in order to maintain their pools.

Based on data contained in the Pkdata US Residential Swimming Pool Market Report (2020), the market
for chemicals for U.S. residential pools was estimated to be $2.6 billion in 2020. While according to the same
Pkdata report, the market is expected to grow at a 3+% CAGR in the five-year period 2020 – 2025, we believe our
Pool Solutions segment will grow in excess of that as we expand our customer base and increase market share with
new dealer relationships and e-commerce channel.

The following table summarizes the end market for each of our segments, the expected growth rates and the
size of the relevant markets.

Many customers are starting to embrace digital technology / data analytics to help track performance and
starting to partner with suppliers with strong R&D capabilities to develop innovative solutions to drive efficiency
and achieve sustainability objectives. This trend is expected to continue and we expect to benefit from it due to our
robust value-added chemistry and technology solutions offering.

_Industrial Solutions_

The global industrial water chemicals market is fragmented, with the top seven players, of which we are
one, covering only approximately 30% of the market, based on a report by a third party expert advisor completed in
June 2021. This is due to the required application-specific expertise and track-record of performance. Hence, by
region and by end-user market, three to five players may have disproportionately high share. We believe we have an
outsized share of the global pulp and paper market, which is one of our larger markets within the Industrial
Solutions segment.

We believe we offer the lowest per unit cost for comparable chemicals compared to our industry peers and
believe that the competitive pricing is our greatest strength in the Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we
offer an array of innovative solutions and comprehensive product lines both in core water treatment and wastewater
segment. Notable competitors include Ecolab / Nalco, Suez, ChemTreat, Kurita, Kemira and SNF. Ecolab which
acquired Nalco in 2011 is the largest water treatment player followed by Suez.

Similar to the consumer market, technology and R&D are becoming increasingly important beyond the
chemical product itself as customers are moving towards advanced analytics to optimize the volume of chemical
treatment, driving select industry participants to increasingly focus on equipment / engineering solutions as opposed
to chemical solutions.

_Pool Solutions_

We believe we are the only true global player in the Pool Solutions segment with leading market positions
in North America, South America, and EMEA. Our primary competitor in this segment is KIK Custom Products,
which provides various pool chemical solutions, with a focus on North America. Other smaller competitors also
compete in this market, with varying breadth and geographical focus, including Hasa Pool, Jandy, Lo-chlor and
Jack’s Magic.

We believe we are the world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment
and sanitation. All three of our cal-hypo facilities are co-located with chlor-alkali producers meaning that raw
materials (chlorine and caustic soda) are delivered into our production plants via a direct pipeline. We believe this is
a major competitive advantage and barrier to entry in the Pool Solutions segment as we believe it would not be
economical for our competitors to open a new cal-hypo facility that is not co-located with a supply of raw materials.

**_Sustainability and Environmental and Social Governance_**

We drive sustainability by reducing water and energy use and raw materials waste while improving
operational productivity. Increased focus on sustainability and ESG is a key trend across both Consumer Solutions
and Industrial Solutions segments and is driving demand as our customers aim to reduce water and energy
consumption, optimize raw materials spend and reduce waste emission. These objectives require increased chemical
use which is driving increased demand for our business.

At the micro level, we provide solutions to customers with specific sustainability goals. For example, our
offering of PFAS-free oil and grease resistant technology has been selected by major brand owners as a replacement
in food service bowls. We also made a series of recommendation to a petroleum company which resulted in a
reduction of 162 million gallons of water per year and approximately $45,000 of savings per year on energy and
chemicals. Our management is dedicated to, and focused on, building and marketing our strong ESG reputation,
shifting to green products and providing value-added services to help our customers achieve their sustainability
targets.

-----

Focus on solving customers’ environmental and sustainability challenges has led to notable results for
Solenis. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, (1) 84% of innovation projects in the pipeline had
sustainability / circularity focus, (2) 84% of Net sales was driven by projects that support customers’ sustainability
goals, (3) 12% of innovation programs focused on Carbon footprint projects, (4) CO2 emission was reduced by 16%
from the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 and (5) we had an Environmental Incident Classification (EIC)
score of 75, which was a 12% improvement from the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We are also focused on long term sustainability goals for our business that include: (1) over 50% of raw
material suppliers to be compliant with sustainable procurement, (2) 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, (3) 5%
reduction in water consumption, (4) over 80% of our revenues to support our customers’ sustainability goals, (5)
100% of our plants to be ISO 9001, RC14001 and SEDEX certified, (6) to have a 5% return on investment from
every commercial person focusing on reduction in energy, water and raw materials as well as improved productivity
and (7) water consumption to be reduced by 5% from the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 by 2030.

**Summary of Operational Improvements and Synergies Initiatives**

We, along with Platinum, have identified synergies resulting from the combination of Sigura and Solenis.
We expect to achieve an estimated $40 million in annual cost synergies from actions taken within 18 months of the
closing of the Transactions. The synergies are expected to be realized through consolidation of support and sales
functions, materials sourcing and facility consolidation.

  - Approximately $33 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved through Sigura’s back office
consolidation into Solenis, as well as consolidation of the Sigura industrial sales organization.

  - Approximately $3 million of cost synergies relate to leveraging Solenis’ infrastructure and resources to
better drive Sigura’s direct materials sourcing through spend scaling.

  - Approximately $4 million of cost synergies are attributable to warehouse and distribution center
optimization as well as the consolidation of Sigura’s Alpharetta facility.

To achieve the identified synergies, we expect to incur approximately $28 million of one-time costs. The
majority of these one-time costs are related to implementation support with the balance related to severance and
other integration costs to ensure business continuity.

Additionally, we, along with Platinum, have identified operational improvements at the existing Solenis
business, resulting from plans from management that are currently underway. We expect to achieve an estimated
$72 million in annual cost savings based on actions implemented over the first four years from the closing of the
Transactions. The cost savings are expected to be realized through raw material sourcing capabilities at Solenis,
pricing and mix optimization, shared service and indirect spend optimization, and 4-wall improvement on
controllable costs at existing facilities.

  - Approximately $31 million of cost savings are expected to be achieved through improvement in sourcing
capabilities at Solenis.

  - Approximately $20 million of cost savings relate to driving pricing adherence to above floor pricing and
our ability to shift margin mix away from lower margin business.

  - Approximately $14 million of cost savings are attributable to expanding the scope of share service
organization (India and Poland) while driving savings in indirect spend categories.

  - Approximately $8 million relate to focus on reducing controllable costs at plants and facilities.

To achieve the identified synergies, we expect to incur approximately $25 million of one-time costs. The
majority of these one-time costs are related to implementation support and other costs to ensure business continuity.

These initiatives will be executed by a dedicated implementation team with support from Platinum
operational executives and third-party resources. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve
these synergies or operational improvements. For more information about our anticipated synergies, including
certain factors that may affect our ability to achieve such synergies or operational improvements. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Reorganization—The anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and
the Reorganization may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, which may adversely
affect our results of operations.”

capital intensity and minimal capital expenditures allow for significant free cash flow generation. See “—Summary
Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data.”

_Long Tenured, Industry leading Management Team with Strong Track Record_

We have an experienced management team with long tenures in the industry and experience in the sector.
Following consummation of the Transactions, the combined company will be led by John E. Panichella, who has
been CEO of Solenis since its inception in 2014, following the initial carve-out from Ashland. Through organic
growth and M&A, particularly the merger with BASF, Panichella has steered Solenis to global leadership in the
specialty chemicals for water-intensive industries. Prior to leading Solenis, John served as President of Ashland
Water Technologies, SVP of Ashland, Group Operating Officer of Ashland Specialty Ingredients and Ashland
Water Technologies, and President of Ashland Aqualon Functional ingredients. Surrounding John is a deep bench
across operations, technology, commercial and finance, including Philip M. Patterson, Jr, current CFO of Solenis
(and who will be CFO of the combined Solenis company following the Transactions), Andreas Tuerk, present and
continuing President of the Consumer Solutions business, Edward Connors, present and continuing President of the
Industrial Solutions business, and Robert Baird, current CEO of Sigura (and who will be President of the Pool
Solutions business following the Transactions). Solenis’ experienced team will drive long-term stability of the
combined business and support future growth.

**Growth Strategy**

We believe we are well positioned to grow organically and capture share through several distinct strategies.
Supportive end market trends that drove historical growth are expected to continue over the next five to ten years.
We have successfully maintained strong pricing discipline to offset inflationary increases to input costs and shift
customers to a more profitable mix, driving margin growth. The combination creates unique, value accretive
synergy opportunities, with line of sight on approximately $40 million of cost synergies (resulting from actions
taken within 18 months of the closing of the Transactions) and an additional approximately $72 million of
operational improvement opportunities within the combined Solenis company (based on further actions
implemented over the first four years from the closing of the Transactions). Our new partnership with Diversey will
allow Solenis access to a greater portion of the attractive Food & Beverage market.

We are also well positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions via multiple M&A avenues. We have
a proven track record as an M&A platform, with 11 transactions completed since 2014, including the transformative

The total addressable food and beverage chemicals market is approximately $2.2 billion. We expect to realize
additional manufacturing absorption benefits as a result of this relationship.

_Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions_

While our primary focus is on organic growth, our global presence, scale and broad product offering
position us well to execute on opportunistic acquisitions given the large and fragmented nature of the markets we
serve or to expand into new markets. We estimate that the markets adjacent to our market represent a total market
size of $42 billion and represent potential expansion areas, including the ion exchange and coagulants markets. We
believe that we can create significant value through strategic acquisitions given our track record of integration.
Solenis has completed 11 acquisitions since 2014, including the transformative and successful merger with BASF’s
water and paper business in 2019. We will focus on maintaining a disciplined acquisition strategy centered on: (i)
expanding our customer base in new and growing end markets and geographies; (ii) improving our customer
offering through access to new products and technological capabilities; and (iii) generating significant purchasing
and other operational synergies.

**Combined Solenis Company Business Resegmentation**

Following a strategic review related to Solenis’ operating segments and in anticipation of the closing of the
Acquisition and the Reorganization, changes will be introduced in the segment reporting from October 1, 2021. To
ensure comparability, Solenis has prepared condensed segment reporting presented on the basis of the new business
segmentation (i) for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 and
(ii) for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2020. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Solenis—Segment Results.”

The segmentation changes are being made for the following reasons: (i) alignment of the segment structure
to ensure that the combined Solenis company’s financial reporting segments are in line with its strategic approach in

19


-----

demarcating its operations and (ii) in order to most effectively manage the combined Solenis company and make
business decisions based on product lines and services.

Major changes relate to: (i) the creation of a new Pool Solutions segment to account for the contribution of
Sigura’s Pools segment, focused on delivering products for the treatment of pools, spas and water parks, (ii) the
renaming of the Pulp & Paper business as the Consumer Solutions business, (iii) the renaming of the Industrial
Water business as the Industrial Solutions business, (iv) the reallocation of the food processing aspects of the
business from the newly named Industrial Solutions business to sit with the other consumer-based products and
services within the newly named Consumer Solutions business, (v) the reallocation of the pulp processing aspects of
the business from the newly named Consumer Solutions business to sit with the other industrial-focused products
and services within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment, (vi) the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial &
Municipal Water business to the newly named Industrial Solutions segment and (vii) the inclusion of Solenis’ RSA
business within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment.

**_Consumer Solutions._** The Pulp & Paper segment of the historical Solenis business will be renamed the
Consumer Solutions segment of the combined Solenis company. The Consumer Solutions segment is mostly
affected by the removal of Pulp and its reallocation to the Industrial Water segment (now renamed the Industrial
Solutions segment).

**_Industrial Solutions._** The Industrial Water segment of the historical Solenis business will be renamed the
Industrial Solutions segment of the combined Solenis company. The Industrial Solutions business is mostly affected
by the inclusion of the RSA segment, the removal of Food and its reallocation to the Pulp & Paper segment (now
renamed the Consumer Solutions segment) and the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial, & Municipal business.

**_Pool Solutions._** Sigura’s Pool segment, including residential and commercial pools, will form the new Pool
Solutions business segment of the combined Solenis company.

**The Transactions**

**The Acquisition and Reorganization**

In July 2014, Solenis (formerly named Ashland Water Technologies (“AWT”)) was acquired by Clayton,
Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) from Ashland Inc. (“Ashland”). In January 2019, as part of a joint venture
arrangement, Solenis merged with the paper and water chemicals business of BASF SE (“BASF”), a Germany-based
chemical manufacturer and distributor, creating a solutions provider for the pulp and paper and water treatment
industries, owned 49.5% by CD&R, 49% by BASF and 1.5% by members of the joint venture management team.

On July 3, 2021, the Sellers, Solenis UK International and Parent entered into the Acquisition Agreement
(which was amended and restated on September 4, 2021), pursuant to which the Solenis business will be acquired by
Parent through the acquisition, by the subsidiaries of Parent, of the Solenis group companies identified in the
Acquisition Agreement as the companies to be acquired pursuant to the Alternative Transaction Structure (as
defined therein), for an aggregate purchase price equal to $5.25 billion, subject to certain adjustments related to
retained capital leases, pension and other liabilities, tax adjustments and other fees. As part of the Acquisition, it is
intended that Solenis Technologies Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Solenis Mexico”) will be acquired and form part of
the combined company. Affiliates of the Issuer have applied for antitrust approval in Mexico in relation to the
acquisition of Solenis Mexico (“Mexican Approval”). If Mexican Approval is obtained on or prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, it is expected that Solenis Mexico will be acquired on the Acquisition Closing Date. If Mexican
Approval is not obtained by the Acquisition Closing Date, we may agree to initially acquire the combined company
without Solenis Mexico and delay the acquisition of Solenis Mexico until Mexican Approval is obtained. Solenis
Mexico represented approximately 2.9% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021.

We expect the purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through:

      - borrowings under the New Credit Facilities;

20


-----

      - proceeds of the Notes offered hereby; and

      - the Equity Investment.

For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” “Description of New Credit
Facilities and Other Indebtedness,” “Description of Unsecured Notes” and “Description of Secured Notes.”

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, (i)
the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals or lapse of certain review periods with respect thereto, (ii) the
absence of a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of
Solenis and its subsidiaries, (iii) the accuracy of representations and warranties (subject to certain materiality
qualifiers), (iv) material compliance with covenants contained in the Acquisition Agreement and (v) the absence of
any law or order (U.S. or foreign) making illegal the consummation of the Acquisition. We currently expect to
receive final approvals and for the consummation of the Acquisition to occur in the third calendar quarter of 2021.
However, there can be no guarantee that we will receive the requisite approvals within this time frame or at all.
Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is expected to close two (2) business days after
all of the requisite closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, unless otherwise agreed.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights of the Sellers and Parent, including the right
to terminate if the Acquisition has not been consummated by the Acquisition Outside Date. The Acquisition
Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The representations and warranties
do not survive the consummation of the Acquisition, and we therefore will have no post-closing contractual
indemnification from the Sellers for any breaches of representations or warranties. Parent intends to purchase
representation and warranty insurance to mitigate some of this risk.

Concurrently with the Acquisition, pursuant to a transaction agreement, dated as of July 3, 2021 (the
“Transaction Agreement”), Platinum and certain of its affiliates will, following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, contribute to Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership, all of the shares of common stock of IWC Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, which represent all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of IWC Holding Corporation, in
exchange for newly issued units in Olympus Water Holding I, L.P., having a value equal to the contributed shares of
IWC Holding Corporation, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately be contributed to each
of Olympus Water Holding II, L.P., and to Olympus Water Holding III, L.P., and to Olympus Water Holding IV,
L.P. and to the Issuer, with the result that IWC Holding Corporation will be held as a subsidiary of the Issuer. The
Reorganization implies a rollover of existing equity interests of the Sponsor and certain of its affiliates in Sigura of
$500 million. See “—Sources and Uses.”

**The Offering, Escrow and Escrow Release**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds
from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be secured by a firstpriority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments therein. The Escrow
Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Assuming the Escrow Release Conditions have been
satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Guarantors will become parties to the Indentures pursuant to one or
more supplemental indentures, and the obligations will become obligations of the Guarantors.

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indentures. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release
Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of
default under the Indentures has or would have occurred and is continuing.”

21


-----

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Acquisition Outside Date,
the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each
series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect
on the applicable series of Notes.”

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see “Description
of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Secured Notes—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**The Refinancing**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and the Reorganization and, if applicable, the satisfaction
of the Escrow Release Conditions, we will consummate the Refinancing using the proceeds from the Notes, the
Equity Investment and the New Credit Facilities.

**The New Credit Facilities**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into the New Term Loan Credit Agreement providing for the
New Term Loan Facility and will enter into the New ABL Credit Agreement providing for the New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility. See “Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

**Equity Investment**

As part of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will fund the Equity Investment of approximately $1,993 million in
cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately be contributed
to each of the Issuer and to Olympus Water UK Holdings Ltd as common equity, and which will be used as part of
the consideration to be paid in connection with the Acquisition.

**Corporate Structure**

The following chart summarizes our corporate structure and principal indebtedness after giving effect to the
Transactions. This chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all legal entities affiliated
with, or all obligations of, the combined Solenis company and its affiliates:

(1) Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization, the Notes will not be guaranteed. From
and after satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions and immediately following the consummation of the
Acquisition and the Reorganization (or on the Issue Date immediately following the Acquisition and
Reorganization if the Acquisition and Reorganization close concurrently with this offering), subject to certain
exceptions, (i) the Unsecured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the Guarantors
and (ii) the Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by each of the Guarantors.

(2) For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our
non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 62% of our Net sales and approximately 62% of our Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 74% of our total assets (excluding
intercompany receivables and investments in subsidiaries) and approximately 19% of our total liabilities
(excluding intercompany payables).

(3) In connection with the Acquisition, we expect to enter into the New ABL Credit Facility which we expect will
provide for $500.0 million of revolving credit commitments, subject to borrowing base capacity and with a
sublimit for letters of credit, with a five-year maturity. We currently anticipate making borrowings of $175.0
million under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility in connection with the closing of the Transactions. See
“Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

(4) In connection with the Transactions, we expect to enter into the New Term Loan Facility which we expect to be
approximately $1,400.0 million in size, subject to exchange rates and sizing between the Dollar and Euro
tranches, with a seven-year maturity. See “Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”
Reflects the expected aggregate principal amount of the New Term Loan Facility, excluding the impact of
unamortized debt discounts.

(5) This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to
the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from
the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At
such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be secured by a first
23


-----

priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments therein. The Escrow
Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Assuming the Escrow Release Conditions have been
satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Guarantors will become parties to the Indentures pursuant to one
or more supplemental indentures, and the obligations will become obligations of the Guarantors.

(6) These amounts do not reflect that it is expected that the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement will remain
outstanding following the consummation of the Transactions, and that one or more of the tranches of
indebtedness constituting the Financing may be reduced accordingly by approximately $90 million in the
aggregate.

(7) Concurrently with the Acquisition, pursuant to a transaction agreement, dated as of July 3, 2021 (the
“Transaction Agreement”), Platinum and certain of its affiliates will, following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, contribute to Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership, all of the shares of common stock of IWC Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, which represent all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of IWC Holding Corporation, in
exchange for newly issued units in Olympus Water Holding I, L.P., having a value equal to the contributed
shares of IWC Holding Corporation, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately be
contributed to each of Olympus Water Holding II, L.P., and to Olympus Water Holding III, L.P., and to
Olympus Water Holding IV, L.P. and to the Issuer, with the result that IWC Holding Corporation will be held
as a subsidiary of the Issuer. The Reorganization implies a rollover of existing equity interests of the Sponsor
and certain of its affiliates in Sigura of $500 million. See “—Sources and Uses.”

**Sources and Uses**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions. The amounts and assumed sources set forth in the table and the accompanying footnotes may vary
from actual amounts on the Acquisition Closing Date depending on several factors, including, without limitation,
amounts outstanding under the Solenis Existing Credit Agreements and the Sigura Existing Credit Agreements, cash
generated in our business, the sizes and permitted uses of the New Credit Facilities, the actual amount of purchase
price adjustments and fees and expenses, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the actual amount we draw
on the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility upon the closing of the Transactions. If this offering closes prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale
of the Notes into segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, upon the release of the funds
from the escrow account, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby will be used to fund a portion of the
Transactions as set forth below. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information and Other
Data” and “The Transactions.” In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be lenders,
agents or managers for the lenders under the Sigura Existing Credit Agreements and/or the Solenis Existing Credit
Agreements and will be entitled to receive customary fees in connection therewith and may receive a portion of the
proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to repay such indebtedness. See “Plan of Distribution” and “Description
of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

**Unsecured Notes ......................** From and after satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, or on the

guarantees will be general, senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and

                   - be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of any non-Guarantor

As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions (not taking into account the impact of the ING Receivables
Purchasing Agreement remaining outstanding):

                   - we would have had total indebtedness of $4 billion (excluding
existing letters of credit, performance guarantees and local lines of
credit), $2,800 million of which would have been secured (without
giving effect to unamortized discounts and deferred financing
costs), which represents borrowings under the New Term Loan
Facility and the issuance of the Secured Notes offered hereby;

                   - we would have had unused commitments under the New ABL
Revolving Credit Facility available to us of $325.0 million; and

                   - our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 19% of
our total liabilities (excluding intercompany payables), all of
which would have been structurally senior to the Notes.

See “Capitalization” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all
obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the
Notes.”

**Additional Amounts .....................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the
Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes unless
required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law in any
“relevant taxing jurisdiction,” subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or
the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the additional amounts
necessary so that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after
the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would
have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction, subject to
certain exceptions. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Withholding
Taxes” and “Description of Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes.”

**Optional Redemption ...................** Each series of Notes will be redeemable at the Issuer’s option, in whole or

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special**
**Mandatory Redemption ...............** This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the
Acquisition. If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the
Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated
escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At such time and until
the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be
secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account
and the deposits and investments therein. The Escrow Release will be
subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Assuming the Escrow Release
Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Guarantors will become parties to the Indentures pursuant to one or more
supplemental indentures, and the obligations will become obligations of the
Guarantors. The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to
consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event of default has
occurred and is continuing under the Indentures. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is
completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release
Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from
escrow even if a default or event of default under the Indentures has or
would have occurred and is continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the
Outside Date, (b) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release
Conditions are deemed, in the Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be incapable
of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to
the Acquisition Outside Date, the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in
accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each
series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price
equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes, plus accrued
and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such
special mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Indebtedness— In the event that the Acquisition is not
consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of
certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory
redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on
the applicable series of Notes.”

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of
the Acquisition, the Notes will not be subject to the escrow procedures
described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating
to, the escrow, see “Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds;
Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Secured Notes—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**Change of Control Offer ..............** Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change in control, subject to
certain exceptions, you will have the right, as holders of each series of the
Notes, to cause the Issuer to repurchase some or all of each series of your

if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of
Control” and “Description of Secured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Change of Control.” The Issuer may not be able to pay you the
required price for Notes you present to it at the time of a change of control
because:

                   - the Issuer may not have enough funds at that time; or

                   - the terms of our New Credit Facilities or other debt facilities may
prevent the Issuer from making such payment.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We
may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or
pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

**Asset Sale Offer ............................** If Parent or any of its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain
circumstances, the Issuer will be required to use the net proceeds to make
an offer to purchase each series of the Notes at an offer price in cash in an
amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of Notes plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of
Holders—Asset Sales” and “Description of Secured Notes—Repurchase at
the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

These covenants will be subject to a number of important exceptions and
qualifications. For more details, see “Description of Unsecured Notes—
Certain Covenants” and “Description of Secured Notes—Certain

Notes have investment grade ratings from certain rating agencies and there
is no default or event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When
Unsecured Notes Rated Investment Grade” and “Description of Secured
Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Secured Notes
Rated Investment Grade.”

Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. The Issuer
does not intend to issue registered notes under the Securities Act or any
state or other securities laws in exchange for the Notes to be privately

impact the transferability of the Notes. For more information, see “Transfer
Restrictions.”

**RISK FACTORS**

_Any investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks_
_described below and all of the information contained in this offering memorandum before deciding whether to invest_
_in the Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face._
_Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our_
_business operations. If any of those risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations_
_would suffer and you could lose all or part of your original investment in the Notes. The risks discussed below also_
_include forward-looking statements, and our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these_
_forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Except where_
_noted or the context otherwise requires, as used in this “Risk Factors” section, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “our_
_company” and “our business” refer to Solenis, Sigura and their respective subsidiaries on a pro forma combined_
_basis after giving effect to the Transactions._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_Our business may be adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and we may face risks_**
**_related to COVID-19 which could significantly disrupt our operations, customer demand, and our suppliers’_**
**_ability to support us, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, operating results,_**
**_and cash flows._**

We are closely monitoring the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19. The virus has spread to
many countries and has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a pandemic, resulting in action from
governments that have significantly affected virtually all facets of global economies.

Governments have implemented enhanced screenings, quarantine requirements, and travel restrictions in
connection with the COVID-19 outbreak. Shelter-in-place orders and other measures, including work-from-home
and social distancing policies implemented to protect employees, may result in reduced workforce availability at
product manufacturing sites, construction delays, and reduced capacity at some of our vendors and suppliers.
Restrictions on our access to or operation of manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or
similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers, can impact our ability to meet customer demand and could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if prolonged. Similarly,
current and future restrictions or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port
closures, and increased border controls or closures, can also impact our ability to meet demand and could materially
adversely affect us. Our customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions in their operations
and supply chains, which can result in delayed, reduced, or canceled orders, or collection risks, and which may
adversely affect our results of operations.

Our business may be more adversely impacted by the effects of COVID-19 in the future. We source
materials from different parts of the world that have been affected by the virus which could have an adverse impact
on our supply chain operations and ability to get materials needed to produce our products. Additionally, the
disruption to global markets that has occurred due to the epidemic has adversely impacted the demand for our goods
and services particularly in the hotel, restaurant and office cleaning sectors. It is possible that the current outbreak
and continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global
recession. There is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such
slowdown or recession. Given the significant economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is
difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products. These expectations are subject to
change without warning and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. The prolonged occurrence
of COVID-19 could result in a significant downturn in the food service, hospitality, office cleaning and travel
industries and a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services, which could materially adversely
affect our business.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel,
employee work locations, cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and social
distancing measures), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we
determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, vendors, and suppliers. Work-from-home

and other measures introduce additional operational risks, including cybersecurity risks, and have affected the way
we conduct our product development, validation, and qualification, customer support, and other activities, which
could have an adverse effect on our operations. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate
the risks posed by the virus, and illness and workforce disruptions could lead to unavailability of key personnel and
harm our ability to perform critical functions.

The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on future
developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, related travel advisories and
restrictions and the efficacy and take-up rates of vaccines, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.
Government shutdown orders may result in a closure of operations for an uncertain duration impacting our business
results. Preventing the effects from and responding to any market disruptions from COVID-19, or any other public
health threat related or otherwise, may further increase costs of our business and may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

While we have taken steps to minimize the potential for COVID-19 exposure in the workplace, the
potential for a COVID-19 outbreak within our facilities occurring and significantly disrupting operations remains
possible. Increased infection rates in geographic locations in which we operate have the potential to result in
disruptions to our operations at an increased rate than we currently experience.

There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a
global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to
change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as
a whole. However, the effects could materially heighten many of our known risks described herein.

**_Uncertain global economic conditions have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

Uncertain or slowing global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on
certain markets we serve (i.e., Graphic and Oil & Gas markets) where global economic downturns can cause
weakened demand. Conversely, other markets (i.e., Packaging and Tissue & Towel) can see an uptick in demand in
these phases of the cycle; however, there can be no assurance of this.

During economic downturns or recessions, there can be a heightened competition for sales and increased
pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us. If we lose
significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly, then there could be a negative impact on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations, profitability and cash flows.

Reduced availability of credit may also adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers
to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures. This could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary
supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers. This could additionally result in
reduced or delayed collections of outstanding accounts receivable.

**_The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our_**
**_consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

We operate in approximately 120 countries. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located
outside of the U.S. and a majority of our Net Sales are generated outside of the U.S. These operations, particularly in
developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations.
Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could
result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.

Risks inherent in our international operations include:

  - non-U.S. currency exchange controls and tax rates;

46


-----

  - non-U.S. currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;

  - the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;

  - restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection
matters, including anti-dumping duties, tariffs, embargoes, economic sanctions, and prohibitions or
restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;

  - changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade and foreign
investment;

  - the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain non-U.S. legal systems;

  - variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;

  - more expansive legal rights of workers outside the U.S., unions, collective bargaining agreements or works
councils;

  - changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;

  - import and export delays;

  - social plans and regulations that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;

  - the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and

  - unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against the countries in which we operate or
other interests.

In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from the various
jurisdictions in which we do business.

These and other factors may have a materially adverse effect on our international operations and consequently,
on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Fluctuations between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial_**
**_condition or results of operations._**

A significant portion of our Net Sales during the year ended September 30, 2020 were generated outside
the United States. We translate sales and other results denominated in non-U.S. currency into U.S. dollars for our
consolidated combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. As a result, we are
exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from our international operations and in translating our
financial results back to U.S. dollars. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales
and net income could be reduced because non-U.S. currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We cannot
predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results. As exchange rates vary, our results
of operations and profitability may be harmed. While we may use financial instruments to hedge certain non-U.S.
currency exposures, this does not insulate us completely from non-U.S. currency effects and exposes us to
counterparty credit risk for non-performance. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than
a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from non-U.S. currency variations. The gains or losses associated
with hedging activities may harm our results of operations.

In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern non-U.S.
investment, non-U.S. trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to

47


-----

repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the U.S. and may limit our ability to convert non-U.S. currency cash
flows into U.S. dollars.

We have recognized foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in
Argentina in 2020, 2019 and 2018 as a result of the country being designated as highly inflationary under U.S.
GAAP.

**_Political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or_**
**_suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations, and cash flows._**

We are exposed to risks inherent in doing business in each of the countries or regions in which we, our
customers, or suppliers operate, including: civil unrest, acts of terrorism, sabotage, epidemics, force majeure, war or
other armed conflict and related government actions, including sanctions/embargoes, the deprivation of contract
rights, the inability to obtain or retain licenses required by us to operate our plants or import or export our goods or
raw materials, the expropriation or nationalization of our assets, and restrictions on travel, payments or the
movement of funds. As some of our customers operate in the hospitality industry that supports both domestic and
international tourism, their business and indirectly ours, could be exposed to the negative consequences of travel
pattern disruptions due to major terrorist threats. Also, if additional restrictions on trade with China and Russia were
adopted by the U.S., the European Union or the United Nations, and were applicable to our products, we could lose
sales and experience lower growth rates in the future.

**_Raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively_**
**_impact our results of operations, including our profit margins and Net Sales._**

We use petrochemical-based raw materials to manufacture many of our products and oil-based materials
for our packaging. The prices for these raw materials are cyclical, and increases in market demand or fluctuations in
the global trade for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy could increase our costs. In addition, the prices of
many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses, such as caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates,
surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances, are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors
that are beyond our control. Furthermore, the usage of certain chemical components used in the manufacturing of
our products, such as such as chemicals used in our surfactants, may be limited or restricted by government
regulations, which could restrict our sourcing options. If we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw
material costs through sourcing, pricing or other actions, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of
operations may be materially adversely affected.

Moreover, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to provide raw materials that meet our
specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules as well as all regulatory requirements. We seek to purchase
our principal raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts in order to ensure availability of such raw
materials. In some cases, there may only be a limited number of suitable suppliers available for certain raw
materials, which increases our dependence on parties that we have no control over. While alternative raw materials
may be available, these may be more expensive and not always compatible with our production processes.

Natural disasters such as hurricanes, as well as political instability and terrorist activities, may negatively
impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers. These factors could lead to increased prices for our
raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers, which could reduce revenues
and profit margins and harm relations with our customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Changes in customer demand could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of_**
**_operations._**

Our chemicals are used for a broad range of applications by our customers. Changes in our customers’ own
products or processes may enable them to reduce or eliminate consumption of the chemicals that we provide.
Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. A significant and
rapid decline in the use of certain chemicals, such as chemicals for packaging and board production, or in the

48


-----

demand of customers’ products, such as certain paper qualities, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
particularly in the P&P segment (now, less Pulp, plus Food, renamed Consumer Solutions). Also increased
awareness of and concern towards climate change and more sustainable products may change customers’ demands,
for example towards water treatment technologies with lower chemical consumption, and this may have a negative
effect particularly on the ability of the IWT segment (now, less Food, plus Pulp, renamed Industrial Solutions) to
compete. Furthermore, if our products fail to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or have a
shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could cease to use our products and services. Any failure by us to be
prepared to meet and manage these changed expectations could result in loss of market share. Any of these factors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects.

**_Unfavorable consumer responses to price increases could have a material adverse impact on our sales and_**
**_earnings._**

From time to time, and especially in periods of rising raw material costs, we increase the prices of our
products. Significant price increases could impact our earnings depending on, among other factors, the pricing by
competitors of similar products and the response by our customers to higher prices. Such price increases may result
in lower volume of sales and a subsequent decrease in gross margin and adversely impact earnings.

**_If we do not develop new and innovative products or if such products are not accepted by customers in our_**
**_markets or fail to meet sales or margin expectations, our results could be negatively affected._**

Our products must be kept current to meet our customers’ needs, overcome competitive products, and meet
evolving regulatory requirements. To remain competitive, we therefore must develop new and innovative products
on an ongoing basis, and we invest significantly in the research and development of new products. If we do not
successfully develop innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors’
products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and results could suffer.

Our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely
manner at favorable margins. The development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve
high levels of investment. New products may not meet sales or margin expectations due to many factors, including
our inability to (i) accurately predict demand, end-user preferences and evolving industry standards, (ii) resolve
technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner or (iii) achieve manufacturing
efficiencies.

**_Production interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition_**
**_and results of operations._**

Our revenues are dependent on the continued operation of our various production facilities. In particular,
the operation of chemical manufacturing plants involves many risks, including the breakdown, failure, or
substandard performance of equipment, natural disasters, power outages, the need to comply with directives of
government agencies, acts of terrorism, and dependence on the ability of railroads and other shippers to transport
raw materials and finished products in a timely manner. The occurrence of material operational problems, or the loss
of production assets, due to, among others, the foregoing events at one or more of our facilities could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. Disruption to
operations at any one of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and future prospects. In addition, in certain circumstances, we could also be materially and
adversely affected by a disruption or closure of a customer’s plant or facility to which it supplies its products.

**_We experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we_**
**_operate._**

Our products compete with similar products made by other manufacturers and with a number of other types
of materials or products. We compete on the basis of performance characteristics of our products, service, price and
innovations in technology. A number of competing U.S. and non-U.S. companies are well-established.

49


-----

The market for our products is highly competitive. Our products face significant competition from global,
national, regional and local companies within some or all of our product lines in each sector that we serve.

Our inability to maintain a competitive advantage could result in lower prices or lower sales volumes for
our products. Additionally, we may not successfully implement our pricing actions. These factors may have an
adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or_**
**_those of third parties with which we do business, could have a materially adverse effect on our business,_**
**_consolidated financial condition and results of operations._**

We rely to a large extent upon automation, software and infrastructure, both internally and with third
parties, to operate our business. The size and complexity of our information technology systems make them
increasingly vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack, which may pose a risk to the security
of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in
the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or
security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal
liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory
costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, consolidated
financial condition and results of operations. While we take reasonable measures to mitigate these risks, due to
continually evolving threats, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable
to advanced and persistent threats.

We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in some of our
businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls of the U.S., the European
Union and other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or
information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be
vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to
the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software
solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective
products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could result in liabilities and penalties
and could damage our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs and adversely affect our business and our results
of operations. Additionally, we could be subject to litigation and government enforcement actions as a result of any
such failure.

The development of internet of things (“IoT”) (our sensors and analyzers that allow for the automation of
chemical treatment programs in complex industrial processes and our automated monitoring and feed systems for
treatment of commercial and residential pools and spas are all examples of internet of things applications) also
presents security, privacy and execution risks. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of
IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal
health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law or harm
individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may
increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our business and operating results.

Furthermore, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations. Our failure to adhere to
or successfully implement appropriate responses in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our
brands’ reputations.

**_Instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit_**
**_that we and our customers need to operate our or their businesses._**

We depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business. Our customers and suppliers also require
access to credit for their businesses. Instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely
impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to us, our customers and our
suppliers. Inability to access credit markets, or a deterioration in the terms on which financing might be available to
us or our customers, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_New and stricter legislation and regulations may affect our business and consolidated financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations. Increased legislative and regulatory
activity and burdens, and a more stringent manner in which they are applied, could significantly impact our business
and the economy as a whole. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits and
other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines and penalties. We may become involved in a number
of legal proceedings and audits, including government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort
and other litigation. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, and other contingencies could require
us to take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of
money, harming our financial condition. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be
necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, harming
our financial condition. There can be no assurance that any pending or future legal or regulatory proceedings and
audits will not harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Furthermore, the regulatory environment in which we operate is still developing, and the potential exists for
future legislation and regulations to be adopted. These developments may adversely affect the customers to whom,
and the markets into which, we sell our products, increase our costs, require additional expenditures to ensure
continued regulatory compliance and otherwise negatively affect our business, consolidated financial condition or
results of operations, including in ways that cannot yet be foreseen.

**_Severe public health outbreaks not limited to COVID-19 may adversely impact our business._**

Our business could be adversely affected by the effect of a future public health epidemic. The United States
and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, public health outbreaks such as Zika virus,
Avian Flu, SARS, H1N1 influenza, and most recently COVID-19. A prolonged occurrence of a contagious disease
such as these could result in a significant downturn in the food service, hospitality and travel industries and also may
result in health or other government authorities imposing restrictions on travel further impacting our end-markets.
Any of these events could result in a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services and adversely
affect our business.

**_Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and non-_**
**_U.S. earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities._**

Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings
before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a
jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions
and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and
assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors (including changes in tax laws and
changes made by regulatory authorities), could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate.

**_We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of_**
**_these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the
international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer
pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our
companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application,
administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any
applicable jurisdiction may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or
characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities were to successfully challenge the tax
treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_The introduction of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) Base Erosion_**
**_and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) may adversely affect our effective rate of tax in future periods._**

Changes in tax laws, which have become more rapid in recent years, or tax rulings related thereto could
affect our financial position and results of operations. For example, in light of continuing global fiscal challenges,
various levels of government and international organizations such as the OECD and the European Union are
increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative or regulatory action to increase tax revenue. These tax
reform efforts, such as the OECD’s BEPS project, are designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger
percentage of their earnings. Although some countries have passed unilateral tax laws based on findings from the
BEPS project, the OECD published a “Programme of Work” in May 2019 which is designed to address the tax
challenges from globalization and an increasingly digitized economy. The OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework
announced on July 1, 2021 broad agreement on the two pillars that comprise the Programme of Work. Pillar One
addresses the broader challenge of a digitalized economy and focuses on the allocation of group profits among
taxing jurisdictions based on a market-based concept rather than historical “permanent establishment” concepts.
Pillar Two addresses the remaining BEPS risk of profit shifting to entities in low tax jurisdictions by introducing a
global minimum tax and a proposed tax on base eroding payments, which will apply to multinational groups with
revenues exceeding EUR 750 million and would consist of a globally coordinated set of rules, including an Income
Inclusion Rule and an Undertaxed Payment Rule, which would operate with reference to a minimum tax rate of at
least 15% (determined on a country by country basis). However, the ultimate impact of the proposals remains
subject to agreement on certain design elements. To date, the proposal has been written broadly enough such that it
is difficult to assess their overall effect. These tax reforms, or any other changes in tax laws, could increase our
effective tax rate and adversely impact our financial results.

**_A major loss of or disruption in our manufacturing and distribution operations or our information systems and_**
**_telecommunication resources could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition or results of_**
**_operations._**

If we experienced a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or other severe weather event,
or a casualty loss from an event such as a fire or flood, at one of our larger strategic facilities or if such an event
affected a key supplier, our supply chain or our information systems and telecommunication resources, then there
could be a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We are dependent
on internal and third party information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit
and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on our information technology infrastructure for fulfilling
and invoicing customer orders, applying cash receipts, and placing purchase orders with suppliers, making cash
disbursements, and conducting digital marketing activities, data processing and electronic communications among
business locations.

We also depend on telecommunication systems for communications between company personnel, our
customers and our suppliers. Future system disruptions, security breaches or shutdowns could significantly disrupt
our operations or result in lost or misappropriated information and may have a materially adverse effect on our
business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Product liability claims or regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial results or harm our reputation_**
**_or the value of our brands._**

Claims for losses or injuries purportedly caused by some of our products arise in the ordinary course of our
business. In addition to the risk of substantial monetary judgments, product liability claims or regulatory actions
could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace or adversely impact the value of
our brands or our ability to sell our products in certain jurisdictions. We could also be required to recall possibly
defective products, or voluntarily do so which could result in adverse publicity and significant expenses. Although
we maintain product liability insurance coverage, potential product liabilities claims could be excluded or exceed
coverage limits under the terms of our insurance policies or could result in increased costs for such coverage.

**_If we are unable to retain key employees and other personnel, our consolidated financial condition or results of_**
**_operations may be adversely affected._**

52


-----

Our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our management team and other key personnel.
Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us, and we need their expertise to execute our business
strategies. If any of our senior management or other key personnel cease to work for us and we are unable to
successfully replace any departing senior management or key personnel, our business, consolidated financial
condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

As a result of the substantial workers council and labor union representation in certain jurisdictions in
which we operate, we will need to consult or negotiate with employee representatives on operational matters
concerning the organization of our labor force, salary inflation or other benefits and re-organizations, which may
lead to reduced flexibility in managing our operations and labor force to respond to opportunities, market changes or
cost challenges, and we may not be able to negotiate mutually acceptable new collective bargaining agreements,
which could materially affect our business.

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, 142 of our employees in the United States,
representing 7.7% of our employees in the United States, were subject to collective bargaining agreements. These
collective bargaining agreements are negotiated with various unions representing our employees. In addition, in
Europe and Latin America, most of our employees are represented by either labor unions or workers councils and
are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are generally renewable on an annual basis. As is the case with
any negotiation, we may not be able to negotiate acceptable new collective bargaining agreements, which could
result in strikes or work stoppages by affected workers. Renewal of collective bargaining agreements could also
result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members. A disruption in operations or higher ongoing labor costs
could materially affect our business.

In addition, in certain jurisdictions, we are required to consult with, and seek the consent or advice of these
labor unions or workers councils for any changes to our activities or employee benefits. This requirement could have
a significant impact on our flexibility in managing costs, responding to market changes, and reorganizing or
restructuring our business. As is the case with any negotiation or consultation, we may not be able to negotiate
mutually acceptable new collective bargaining agreements, which could result in delays, strained employee relations
and after escalation, potential strikes or work stoppages by affected workers, each of which could materially affect
our business.

**_We are subject to a variety of environmental and product registration laws that expose us to potential financial_**
**_liability and increased operating costs._**

Our operations are subject to a number of federal, state, local and non-U.S. environmental health and safety
laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacturing of our products, the discharge of pollutants
into the air, soil and water and the use handling, transportation, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.

Many jurisdictions require us to have operating permits for our production and warehouse facilities and
operations. Any failure to obtain, maintain or comply with the terms of these permits could result in fines or
penalties, revocation or nonrenewal of our permits, or orders to cease certain operations, and may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We generate, use and dispose of hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. In the event our
operations result in the release of hazardous materials into the environment, we may become responsible for the
costs associated with the investigation and remediation of sites at which we have released pollutants, or sites where
we have disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes, even if we fully complied with environmental
laws at the time of disposal. We have been, and may continue to be, responsible for the cost of remediation at some
locations.

Many jurisdictions have laws and regulations that govern the registration, labeling and sale of some of our
products. Throughout the world, such regulations continue to increase both in number and in stringency, resulting in,
among others, extra charges for single use packaging in Europe, duplicative regulations as a result of Brexit,
regulatory-driven and customer-driven ingredient bans requiring reformulation, ingredient disclosure requirements
in the U.S., Asia and potentially Europe, and the incurrence of plastic levies under the European Union Multiannual

53


-----

Financial Framework 2021 – 2027 and Recovery Fund, all of which create a risk of increased costs and a need to
modify our products.

We cannot predict with reasonable certainty the future cost to us of environmental compliance, product
registration, or environmental remediation. Environmental laws have become more stringent and complex over time.
Our environmental costs and operating expenses will be subject to evolving regulatory requirements and will depend
on the scope and timing of the effectiveness of requirements in these various jurisdictions. As a result of such
requirements, we may be subject to increased compliance costs, increasing risks and penalties associated with
violations, or our inability to market some of our products in certain jurisdictions, which may have a materially
adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our exposure to potential environmental liabilities is inherently uncertain, our existing indemnification_**
**_provisions may not cover all liabilities, and could be exacerbated by the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,_**
**_dissolution or other winding up of Ashland._**

Inherent uncertainties exist in our potential environmental liabilities primarily due to unknown conditions,
whether future claims may fall outside the scope of indemnification provisions, changing governmental regulations
and legal standards regarding liability, and evolving technologies for handling site remediation and restoration.

Under the terms of the initial carve-out of the Solenis business from Ashland when it was acquired by
CD&R in July 2014, Solenis UK International Limited is indemnified for certain pre-existing environmental
remediation costs. In the event of the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of
Ashland, we may stand to recover less than the indemnification provisions entitle us to or we may not recover any
amount at all.

In connection with the joint venture arrangement, whereby Solenis merged with the paper and water
chemicals business of BASF in January 2019, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis UK
International Limited. During the diligence process related to the acquisition, diligence was performed related to
potential environmental liabilities. As of September 30, 2020, Solenis UK International Limited does not have
material contingent environmental obligations which are both probable and estimable related to these production
facilities or other real property acquired from BASF.

As of September 30, 2020, Solenis UK International Limited has recorded environmental remediation
reserves of $1.8 million, which are related to two environmental remediation matters. Of the $1.8 million reserved,
$1.0 million is accrued liability relating to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination
associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 of accrued liability relates to potential exposure
related to ground contamination at the Company’s Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve of accrued
liability for a potential exposure related to a United States Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount
reserved for both matters represents management’s best estimate of total expenses to be incurred, and was made
with the assistance of a third-party specialist.

There can be no guarantee that such indemnifications or reserves will be sufficient to cover any or all
environmental remediation costs or otherwise in connection with such matters. Environmental, health and safety
laws and regulations generally provide onerous requirements for companies that are found to be responsible for
violations, often irrespective of actual fault. As a result, we could be subject to future claims, investigations or
proceedings that may impose fines or remedial obligations, either in excess of existing indemnifications or reserves,
or in respect of future pollution, hazardous wastes or other environmental issues at the sites at which we own or
operate. In addition, we could be affected by business interruptions due to authorities closing entire facilities or parts
thereof.

If we become subject to one or more such environmental liabilities, this could have a negative impact on
our reputation as well as a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
connection with our existing indemnification, the possibility is considered remote that environmental remediation
costs will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements over the next 12 months.

**_Our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage_**
**_could adversely impact our business._**

Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and the use
of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we
believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all
liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury, death, or property damage arising in the
ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at
economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance,
we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_We may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti-corruption laws and any determination that we violated_**
**_these laws could have a materially adverse effect on our business._**

We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit companies and their agents from making
improper payments or offers of payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We conduct business in
countries and regions that are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Activities in
these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents
that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”).
We have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents but we
cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts
committed by employees or agents. If our employees or agents violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate
record keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to
regulatory sanctions. Violations of the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, or allegations of such acts, could damage
our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and
related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and
could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees which could adversely affect our business,
consolidated financial condition and results of operations.

**_If we are not able to protect our trade secrets or maintain our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property,_**
**_we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing similar products or from marketing their products in a_**
**_manner that capitalizes on our intellectual property, and this loss of a competitive advantage could decrease our_**
**_profitability and liquidity._**

Our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends, in part, on our ability to maintain the
proprietary nature of our owned and licensed intellectual property. If we were unable to maintain the proprietary
nature of our intellectual property and our significant current or proposed products, this loss of a competitive
advantage could result in decreased sales or increased operating costs, either of which could have a materially
adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

We rely on trade secrets to maintain our competitive position, including protecting the formulation and
manufacturing techniques of many of our products. As such, we have not sought U.S. or international patent
protection for some of our principal product formulas and manufacturing processes. Accordingly, while we seek to
use our protected trade secrets to defend our continued right to sell products against those seeking to assert patents
on innovation that is similar to or competitive with our trade secrets, we may not be able to prevent others from
developing products that are similar to or competitive with our products.

We own, or have licenses to use a large number of patents and pending patent applications on our products,
aspects thereof, methods of use and/or methods of manufacturing. There is a risk that our owned and licensed
patents may not provide meaningful protection and patents may never be issued for our pending patent applications.

We own, or have licenses to use the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the
packaging, marketing, and distribution of our major products where our products are principally sold. Trademark
and trade name protection is important to our business. Although most of our trademarks are registered in the

55


-----

countries in which we operate, we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection. The costs
required to protect our trademarks and trade names may be substantial.

We cannot be certain that we will be able to assert our intellectual property rights successfully in the future
or that they will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Other parties may infringe on or misappropriate
our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our intellectual property in the marketplace. In
addition, the laws of some non-U.S. countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as
the laws of the U.S. As a result, litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property, and such litigation
may be time-consuming and costly. We have been, and continue to be, in active intellectual property litigations.

While we take measures to protect our intellectual property and assert our intellectual property rights, we
cannot be certain that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products,
obtain information we regard as proprietary, or design around patents issued to us or other intellectual property
rights of ours. Any failure by us to protect our trade secrets, patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property
rights may have a materially adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

**_Our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which may cause us to incur unexpected_**
**_costs or prevent us from selling our products._**

Many of our competitors have a substantial amount of intellectual property that we must continually strive
to avoid infringing. Third parties, including competitors, may assert intellectual property infringement,
misappropriation or invalidity claims against us that could be upheld. Intellectual property litigation, which could
result in substantial costs to and a diversion of effort by us may be necessary to protect our intellectual property
rights, including trade secrets, proprietary technology or for us to defend against claimed infringement or
misappropriation of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of our or others’ intellectual property
or proprietary rights. We may not prevail in any such litigation, and if we are unsuccessful, we may be subject to
monetary liability and injunctive or equitable relief, which may prevent our use of others’ intellectual property or
proprietary rights if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses on reasonable terms or at all.

Although it is our policy and intention not to infringe valid patents of which we are aware and we conduct
patent clearance analyses to identify patents that our new products and services might infringe as well as make
necessary product or process changes to avoid infringement, we cannot provide assurances that our processes and
products and other activities do not and will not infringe issued patents (whether present or future) or other
intellectual property rights belonging to others. Third parties have, from time to time, asserted intellectual propertyrelated claims against us, including claims for alleged patent infringement, and there is the continued risk that such
claims may be made against our products and services or our customers’ use of our products or services. We may
also be subject to indemnity claims by our business partners arising out of claims of their alleged infringement of the
patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties in connection with their use of our products
and services. If we were to discover that any of our processes, technologies or products infringe on the valid
intellectual property rights of others, we might determine to obtain licenses from the owners of these rights or to
modify our processes or technologies or re-engineer our products in order to avoid infringement. We may not be
able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or be able to modify our processes or technologies or reengineer our products in a manner that is successful in avoiding infringement. Moreover, if we are sued for
infringement and lose, we could be required to pay substantial damages and/or be enjoined from using or selling the
infringing products or technology. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from
selling our products and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

**_We rely on software from third parties, including open source software, and a failure to properly manage our use_**
**_of third-party software could result in increased costs or loss of revenue._**

Certain of our products are designed to include software licensed from third parties. Such third-party
software includes software licensed from commercial suppliers and software licensed under public open source
licenses. We have internal processes to manage our use of such third-party software. However, if we fail to
adequately manage our use of third-party software, then we may be subject to copyright infringement or other thirdparty claims. In the case of open source software licensed under certain “copyleft” licenses, the license itself, or a
court-imposed remedy for non-compliant use of the open source software, may require that parts of our proprietary

56


-----

software code be publicly disclosed or licensed. This could result in a loss of intellectual property rights, increased
costs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of revenue.

**_Operations in emerging markets include risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business,_**
**_consolidated financial condition or results of operations._**

We have sales operations in 120 countries and manufacturing and lab operations in 21 countries, some of
which have political, economic and legal systems that are less predictable than in countries with more developed
institutional structures, including Brazil and China. Political or economic upheaval, changes in laws and other
factors could have a material adverse effect on our operations in these countries and, in turn, the amount of income
from, and the value of, the investments we have made, and may make in the future, in relation to its operations in
such countries. Operations in some emerging market countries also include the risk of the possibility of
expropriation or nationalization of assets. Also, the establishment or enforcement of foreign exchange restrictions
could effectively prevent us from receiving profits from, or from selling its investments in, these countries.

**_Our inability to consummate and effectively incorporate acquisitions into our business operations may adversely_**
**_affect our results of operations._**

We invest time and resources into carefully assessing opportunities for acquisitions, and we continue to
evaluate potential acquisition opportunities to support, strengthen and grow our business, including potentially in the
near term. Despite diligence and integration planning, acquisitions still present certain risks, including the time and
economic costs of integrating an acquisition’s technology, control and financial systems, unforeseen liabilities, and
the difficulties in bringing together different work cultures and personnel. Although we have completed many
acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates, acquire possible
acquisition candidates, acquire such candidates on commercially reasonable terms, or integrate acquired businesses
successfully in the future. Future acquisitions, including those we may consummate in the near term, may require us
to incur additional debt and contingent liabilities, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and
consolidated financial condition. The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may
result in operating, contractual and supply chain difficulties, such as the failure to retain customers or management
personnel. Such difficulties may divert significant financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing
operations, and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives.

Additionally, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions in the future on terms acceptable to us, or at
all. Future acquisitions are accompanied by the risk that the obligations and liabilities of an acquired company may
not be adequately reflected in the historical financial statements of that company and the risk that those historical
financial statements may be based on assumptions that are incorrect or inconsistent with our assumptions or
approach to accounting policies. Any of these material obligations, liabilities or incorrect or inconsistent
assumptions could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.

**_Social unrest may materially and adversely impact our business._**

Since May 2020, there has been increasing social unrest throughout the United States and Europe
(including looting, protests, strikes and street demonstrations). We have many offices, factories and warehouses
located across the United States and Europe, and such social unrest could materially affect the ability of certain of
these offices to operate. Prolonged disruptions because of such social unrest in the markets in which we operate
could disrupt our relationships with customers, employees and referral sources located in affected areas and, in the
case of our corporate office, our ability to provide administrative support services, including billing and collection
services. Future civil insurrection, social unrest, protests, looting, strikes or street demonstrations may adversely
affect our reputation, business and consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

**_We may record future goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment charges related to our reporting units,_**
**_which could materially adversely impact our results of operations._**

We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles asset balances for impairment during the fourth
quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment

57


-----

may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for
impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated Net Sales projections, growth rates, cash flows
and discount rates. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates
underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can
vary from actual results. Declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in
other key assumptions may result in future goodwill impairment charges, which could materially adversely impact
our results of operations.

**Risks Related to the Acquisition and Reorganization**

**_The unaudited pro forma financial information included in this offering memorandum may not be representative_**
**_of our results if the Acquisition and Reorganization is consummated, and accordingly, you have limited financial_**
**_information on which to evaluate our financial performance and your investment decision._**

The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have actually occurred had the Acquisition and
Reorganization been completed as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of our future operating results or
financial position. The pro forma financial information does not reflect future non-recurring charges resulting from
the Acquisition and Reorganization. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect future events
that may occur after the Acquisition and Reorganization and does not consider potential impacts of current market
conditions on revenues or expenses. Certain adjustments and assumptions have been made regarding the combined
Solenis company consolidated under Parent after giving effect to the Acquisition and Reorganization in the pro
_forma financial information included in this offering memorandum. Our assets and liabilities have been measured at_
fair value based on various preliminary estimates using assumptions that management believes are reasonable
utilizing information currently available. The process for estimating the fair value of acquired assets and assumed
liabilities requires the use of judgment in determining the appropriate assumptions and estimates. These estimates
may be revised as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Differences
between preliminary estimates in the pro forma financial information and the final acquisition accounting will occur
and could have a material impact on the pro forma financial information and the combined organization’s financial
position and future results of operations.

In addition, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not prove to be
accurate, and other factors may affect our financial condition or results of operations following the closing. See “—
Risks Related to Our Business” and “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

**_We cannot assure you that our actual interest expense will not be materially higher than pro forma cash interest_**
**_expense as presented in this offering memorandum._**

In calculating our interest expense for purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
data presented in this offering memorandum, we have made certain assumptions with respect to the interest rates
that would apply to the debt we will incur at the closing of the Transactions. These adjustments are set forth in
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” The actual interest rates on the debt we will
incur at the closing of the Transactions may differ materially from the assumed interest rates we have used in
preparing the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information, based on fluctuations in interest rates
and/or variability in actual amounts drawn on financing facilities.

**_Neither the Issuer nor Parent currently controls the acquired business and will not control the acquired business_**
**_until completion of the Acquisition._**

Although Solenis is subject to certain interim operating covenants in the Acquisition Agreement, neither
the Issuer nor Parent controls Solenis until the completion of the Acquisition. Until that time, the Issuer cannot
assure you that Solenis will be operated in the same way that it would be operated if it had been owned by Parent
during such period. The covenants in the Indentures will not apply to the Solenis entities to be acquired until the
consummation of the Acquisition.

**_We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in_**
**_Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After_**
**_Synergies)._**

We have made adjustments to EBITDA to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined EBITDA,
Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies). These
adjustments reflect certain items related to our business strategy, including the implementation of certain operational
improvement initiatives, as well as the closing of the Transactions.

For example, in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we have added back, among other things, (i) for Solenis,
the impact of realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, severance payments associated with
restructuring, non-cash expense for equity compensation plans, financing expenses, non-service costs for pensions
and other non-operational items, fees paid to Solenis’ current shareholders and merger related costs, integration,
other non-recurring items, incentive compensation above 1.0x of the applicable target, one-time income related to
the clawback of bonuses realized in 2021, non-cash gains on an asset disposal and pre-acquisition EBITDA for the
acquisitions by Solenis of Chemsystems Pulp and Paper business, Poliquimicos, S.A. de C.V. and MFG Chemicals
and, in prior periods, adjustments related to the JV and, (ii) for Sigura, the impact of non-operating income/expense,
including Sigura’s gain on the sale of Surface Water in October 2020, fees paid to Platinum, one-time consulting
and transaction costs related to the separation from its previous owners, as well as other non-recurring and unusual
costs, one-time consulting and other costs related to implementation of operational improvement plans, severance
payments associated with restructuring, unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, the disposal of a fixed asset and
the divestiture of its Surface Water segment and Argentina business.

Our ability to realize the expected benefit or cost savings associated with the adjustments included or
permitted by the Indentures and the New Credit Agreements to be included when calculating Pro Forma Combined
Adjusted EBITDA, including our adjustments for synergies identified in calculating Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA (After Synergies), including $40 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions expected
to be taken within 18 months of the closing of the Transactions as further described in “Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures” and “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data,” depends on factors
beyond our control, such as operating difficulties, increased operating costs, competitors, customers delays in
implementing initiatives, the incurrence of other unexpected costs associated with operating our business, our ability
to integrate businesses that we acquire and general economic or market conditions. We cannot assure you that we
will be successful in generating growth, maintaining or increasing our cash flows or profitability or achieving
expected cost savings in connection with the items reflected in these adjustments. Moreover, our continued
implementation of these initiatives will cause us to incur additional costs and may disrupt our operations and
performance. Our estimated cost savings from these initiatives are based on several assumptions that may prove to
be inaccurate and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will realize these cost savings. If, for any reason, the
benefits we realize are less than our estimates or our improvement initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost
more than we have projected or take longer to implement than we have projected, or if our assumptions prove
inaccurate, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected. We cannot assure you that Adjusted
EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA or Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies)
will reflect the actual benefit of the related adjustments.

**_Litigation may be filed that could prevent or delay the consummation of the Transactions._**

The Sellers or their affiliates, the Solenis entities to be acquired, and members or their respective boards of
directors may be parties, among others, to various claims and litigation related to the Transactions. Among other
remedies, in certain cases, the plaintiffs in such matters may seek to enjoin the consummation of the Transactions.
The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict, and could delay or prevent the consummation of the
Transactions. Moreover, litigation could be time consuming and expensive, could divert management’s attention
away from their regular business, and, if any potential lawsuit is adversely resolved against Solenis, could have a
material adverse impact on either of their business, financial condition and results of operations.

One of the conditions to the consummation of the Transactions is that no law, order or injunction prohibits
the consummation of the Transactions. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in any
potential lawsuit and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely

59


-----

affecting our ability to consummate the Transactions on the terms contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, then
such injunctive or other relief may prevent the consummation of the Transactions in a timely manner or at all.

**_The closing of the Acquisition is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals from government entities._**

The completion of the Acquisition is subject to certain filing requirements, mandatory waiting periods
and/or receipt of necessary or advisable approvals, clearances or consents, as applicable, under the competition laws
of several jurisdictions. Although we expect that all required regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained,
we cannot assure you that these regulatory clearances and approvals will be obtained in a timely manner, obtained at
all or that the granting of these regulatory clearances and approvals will not involve the imposition of additional
conditions on the completion of the Acquisition, including the requirement to divest assets or require changes to the
terms of the Acquisition Agreement.

**_The anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and the Reorganization may not be fully realized or may take longer to_**
**_realize than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations._**

The proposed Acquisition and the Reorganization involves the integration of Solenis’ and Sigura’s
operations, and there are uncertainties and challenges inherent with this integration which may cause the anticipated
benefits of the Acquisition and the Reorganization not being fully realized or taking longer to realize than expected.
We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Solenis’ and Sigura’s
operations. Delays or unexpected difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Issues that must be addressed in integrating operations include, among other
things:

      - conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation;

      - consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;

      - consolidating sales and marketing operations;

      - retaining key employees;

      - retaining existing customers and attracting new customers;

      - identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;

      - minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns;

      - coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; and

      - managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations.

Even if we are able to integrate our operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization
of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings and operational efficiencies that we expect or the achievement of these
benefits within a reasonable period of time. In addition, Parent may have not discovered during the due diligence
process, and Parent may not discover prior to closing, all known and unknown factors regarding the Acquisition that
could produce unintended and unexpected consequences following the Acquisition and the Reorganization.
Undiscovered factors could result in us incurring financial liabilities, which could be material, and in us not
achieving the expected benefits from the Acquisition and the Reorganization within our desired time frames, if at all.

**_Failure to retain our key employees could diminish the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition._**

The success of the Acquisition will depend in part upon the retention of personnel critical to our businesses
due to, for example, their technical skills or management expertise. Employees may experience uncertainty about
their future roles until clear strategies are announced or executed. If we are unable to retain personnel that are

60


-----

critical to our operations, we could experience disrupted operations, loss of customers, key information, expertise
and knowhow, or unanticipated hiring and training costs. In addition, the loss of key personnel could diminish the
anticipated benefits of the Acquisition that are actually achieved by us.

**_Uncertainty regarding the Acquisition may cause customers and suppliers to delay or defer decisions concerning_**
**_us and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

The Acquisition will occur only if stated conditions are met, many of which are outside our control, and
both the Sellers and Parent have rights to terminate the Acquisition Agreement under specified circumstances.
Accordingly, there may be uncertainty regarding the completion of the Acquisition. This uncertainty may cause
customers and suppliers to delay or defer decisions concerning our products, which could negatively affect our
business. Customers and suppliers may also seek to change existing agreements with us as a result of the
Acquisition. Any delay or deferral of those decisions or changes in existing agreements could have a material
adverse effect on our business, regardless of whether the Acquisition is ultimately completed.

**_We have incurred and expect to incur significant costs in connection with the Acquisition, which may adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition or results of operations._**

We have incurred and expect to incur significant fees and expenses in connection with the Transaction, as
indicated under “Use of Proceeds,” which costs we cannot estimate accurately at this time. Consequently, we may
incur material charges in connection with the Acquisition, which may impact our financial results or cash flows.

**Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness**

**_Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, limit our ability to raise additional_**
**_capital to fund our operations, restrict our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to_**
**_interest rate risk and risk of default and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes and our other_**
**_indebtedness._**

After this offering and the application of the net proceeds therefrom, we will have a significant amount of
indebtedness. As a result of our substantial indebtedness incurred in connection with the Transactions, a significant
amount of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and we may
not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowings available under the New ABL
Revolving Credit Facility, to enable us to repay our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity
needs. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total
indebtedness of $4,007 million (excluding existing letters of credit, performance guarantees and local lines of credit
and taking into account the impact of the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement remaining outstanding), including
the Notes and borrowings under the New Term Loan Facility, and we would have had unused commitments under
the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility available to us of $325.0 million. For the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our cash interest expense would have been
approximately $197.6 million, based on the estimated blended effective interest rate utilized in the “Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.”

In addition, although the terms of the New Credit Agreements, the Indentures and our other debt
instruments contain restrictions on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional indebtedness, these
restrictions are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in
compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Further, these restrictions will not prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness. The more leveraged we become, the more we, and in turn our
security holders, will be exposed to risks related to our high level of debt. Our substantial indebtedness could have
important consequences. For example, it could:

    - limit our ability to borrow money for our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service
requirements, strategic initiatives, acquisitions or other purposes;

61


-----

    - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other
indebtedness;

    - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our
indebtedness, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;

    - make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;

    - restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, engaging in development activities, introducing new
technologies or exploiting business opportunities;

    - cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;

    - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates, as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings
under the New Credit Facilities, are at variable rates of interest;

    - impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future;

    - prevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase all Notes tendered to us upon the occurrence
of certain changes of control, which failure to repurchase would constitute an event of default under
the Indentures;

    - place us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors and affecting our ability to
compete; and

    - increase our cost of borrowing.

In addition, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that will limit our
ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants
could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of substantially all
of our indebtedness.

**_We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to service all of our indebtedness, including_**
**_the Notes, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may_**
**_not be successful._**

Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations, including the Notes, depends
on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive
conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be
able to maintain a level of cash flows from operations sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any,
and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to
dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our
indebtedness, including the Notes. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain loans or other debt financings on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our
scheduled debt service obligations. The New Credit Agreements and the Indentures will restrict our ability to
dispose of certain assets and use the proceeds from such dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or
equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. Because of these restrictions, we may not
be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service
obligations then due.

62


-----

Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our
indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our business,
financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.

Additionally, if we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the
Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the New Credit
Facilities could terminate their commitments to loan additional money to us, the lenders could foreclose against the
assets securing their respective borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any or all of
these events could result in your losing all or a part of your investment in the Notes.

Further, we conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Our most significant assets
are the equity interests that we directly and indirectly hold in our subsidiaries. As a result, we are dependent upon
dividends, cash pooling and other payments from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our
outstanding debt service and other obligations and such dividends may be restricted by law, restrictions or taxes on
cash repatriation or in the instruments governing our indebtedness, including the Indentures, the New Credit
Agreements or other agreements of our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from
operations to enable us to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes.

In addition, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities. Certain of our subsidiaries will not
become Guarantors. Unless they are Guarantors or guarantors of our other indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not
have any obligation to pay amounts due on the Notes or our other indebtedness or to make funds available for that
purpose. Further, we may be limited in our ability to cause any future joint ventures to distribute their earnings to us.
Subject to certain qualifications, our subsidiaries are permitted under the terms of our indebtedness, including the
Indentures, to incur additional indebtedness that may restrict payments from those subsidiaries to us. We cannot
assure you that agreements governing the current and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries will permit those
subsidiaries to provide us with sufficient cash to fund principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, including
the Notes.

**_Despite our level of indebtedness after the Transactions, we and our subsidiaries may still incur substantially_**
**_more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to our financial condition described above and impair our_**
**_ability to operate our business._**

We and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the
Indentures and the New Credit Agreements will contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, including with respect to our ability to
incur additional senior secured debt. The additional indebtedness we may incur in compliance with these restrictions
could be substantial. If we incur any additional secured indebtedness that ranks equally with the Secured Notes, the
holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the Secured Notes in any proceeds distributed in
connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of the Issuer or any
Guarantor. If we incur any additional indebtedness that ranks equally with the Unsecured Notes, subject to collateral
arrangements, the holders of that debt will be entitled to share ratably with holders of the Unsecured Notes (or, in
the case of secured debt, senior to holders of the Unsecured Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness) in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution or other winding up of the Issuer or any Guarantor. This could reduce the amount of proceeds paid to
you. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness
(including, among others, trade payables and other expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business). In
addition, as of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, the New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility would have provided for unused commitments of $325.0 million (not taking into account the impact
of the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement remaining outstanding). See “Capitalization.”

Additionally, we have the option to raise incremental term loans or increase our commitments under the
New Credit Agreements by certain amounts pursuant to the New Credit Agreements. Such increases would be
secured indebtedness. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would
increase, including the risk that we will be unable to repay the Notes. See “Description of New Credit Facilities and
Other Indebtedness,” and “Description of Unsecured Notes” and “Description of Secured Notes.”

-----

**_The Indentures and the New Credit Agreements will contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose_**
**_significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our_**
**_long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:_**

    - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

    - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;

    - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;

    - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities;

    - make acquisitions, loans advances and other investments;

    - sell or otherwise transfer assets;

    - incur liens;

    - enter into agreements containing prohibitions affecting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates; and

    - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:

    - limited in how we conduct our business;

    - unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business
downturns; or

    - unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

These restrictions might hinder our ability to grow in accordance with our strategies. With respect to the
New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, we expect we will also be required by a springing financial covenant to, on any
date when Adjusted Availability (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the
greater of (i) 10% of the lesser of the Line Cap (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement)
and (ii) $25.0million, maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1:00 to 1:00, tested for the four fiscal
quarter period ending on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financials have been
delivered, and at the end of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter until the date on which Adjusted Availability
has exceeded the greater of (x) 0% of the Line Cap, and (y) $25.0 million for 30 consecutive calendar days. Our
ability to meet the financial covenant could be affected by events beyond our control.

A breach of the covenants under the Indentures or under the New Credit Agreements could result in an
event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default, if not cured or waived, may allow the creditors to
accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt that is subject to an applicable crossacceleration or cross-default provision. In addition, an event of default under the New Credit Agreements would
permit the lenders under the New Credit Facilities to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under the
New Credit Facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the New Credit
Facilities, those lenders could proceed against the collateral securing such indebtedness. In the event our lenders or
holders of the Notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient
assets to repay that indebtedness.

64


-----

**_The Guarantors’_** **_accession to the Indentures and the release of the gross proceeds from escrow accounts may_**
**_result in a taxable event for holders of the Notes._**

Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position that the release of the gross
proceeds from escrow accounts should not result in a taxable event to holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
It is possible, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could take a contrary view and seek to treat
such holders as exchanging the Notes of any series for “new” Notes of such series in a deemed exchange for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully asserted this position (and a deemed exchange failed to qualify
as a recapitalization), such holders would be required to recognize any gain or loss in connection with such
exchange and would have a new holding period and a new tax basis in the “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. For more information, see “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations—Effect of Escrow Release
and Related Transactions.”

**_If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us, holders of the Notes may receive a lesser amount for their_**
**_claim than they would have been entitled to receive under the Indentures governing the Notes._**

If a bankruptcy petition were filed by or against us under Title 11 of the U.S. Code, as amended, modified
or supplemented, from time to time (the “Bankruptcy Code”) after the issuance of the Notes, the claim by any holder
of the Notes for the principal amount of the notes may be limited to an amount equal to the sum of:

  - the original issue price for the Notes; and

  - that portion of any original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes that does not
constitute “unmatured interest” for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code.

Any OID that was not amortized as of the date of the bankruptcy filing may constitute unmatured interest
for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, holders of the Notes under these circumstances may receive a
lesser amount than they would be entitled to under the terms of the applicable Indenture governing the applicable
series of the Notes, even if sufficient funds are available.

**_Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to_**
**_increase significantly._**

Borrowings under the New Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate
risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even
though the amount borrowed may remain the same, and our profit and cash flows, including cash available for
servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming that the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility is
fully drawn, each one-eighth percentage point change in interest rates would result in a change of approximately
$2.4 million in annual interest expense on the indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities.

In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate
interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, it is possible that we will not maintain interest
rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness. Alternatively, any swaps we enter into may not
fully or effectively mitigate our interest rate risk.

**_The phase-out of LIBOR could increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us._**

Dollar-denominated borrowings under the New Credit Facilities will use the London Interbank Offering
Rate (“LIBOR”) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The Financial Conduct Authority of the
United Kingdom has announced that it plans to phase out LIBOR by June 2023. It is unclear if LIBOR will cease to
exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after
June 2023. Although our borrowing arrangements will provide for alternative base rates, those alternative base rates
historically would often have led to increased interest rates, in some cases significantly higher, than those we will
have paid based on LIBOR, and may similarly be higher in the future. Therefore, if LIBOR ceases to exist, the
interest rates on dollar-denominated borrowings under the New Credit Facilities will likely change.

65


-----

The consequences of the phase out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. Any alternative rate
for calculating interest with respect to our indebtedness may not be as favorable or perform in the same manner as
LIBOR and could lead to an increase in our interest expense or could impact our ability to refinance some or all of
our indebtedness. In addition, the transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or
illiquidity in financial markets, which could also have an adverse effect on us whether or not any replacement rate
applicable to our borrowings is affected. Any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR, as well as other
unforeseen impacts, may result in increased interest expense and other expenses, difficulties, complications or
delays in connection with future financing efforts or otherwise have an adverse impact on our financial condition.

**_Claims of the senior secured creditors will have priority with respect to their collateral over the claims of holders_**
**_of the Unsecured Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In addition, claims of_**
**_lenders under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility and certain other future indebtedness will have priority_**
**_over the claims of holders of the Secured Notes, to the extent of the value of the assets that secure such_**
**_indebtedness, on a senior basis to the Secured Notes._**

The Unsecured Notes will not be secured by any of our assets. As such, the Unsecured Notes and the
applicable guarantees will be subordinated to any senior secured liabilities (including obligations with respect to the
New Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes and any other indebtedness that is allowed to rank pari passu with such
New Credit Facilities and/or Secured Notes) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In
the event of any receivership, foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, administration or
other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor that has secured obligations (including
obligations with respect to the New Credit Facilities and the Secured Notes), holders of senior secured liabilities will
have prior claims to the assets of such entities that are subject to their security, and the proceeds from the sale of
assets securing any senior secured liabilities will be available to repay obligations on the Unsecured Notes only after
all obligations under any senior secured liabilities and all prior ranking claims that may arise pursuant to applicable
law have been paid in full. As a result, holders of Unsecured Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of senior
secured liabilities of the Issuer or relevant Guarantor or if the holders of such senior secured indebtedness are not
paid in full, may not recover any amount at all. In addition, depending on the type of proceeding initiated, holders of
the Unsecured Notes and applicable guarantees may be stayed from exercising their rights under the Unsecured
Notes or applicable guarantee, as applicable, pursuant to a court order or applicable law. Additionally, the Secured
Notes will be secured on a second-priority basis in the Current Asset Collateral. As such, the Secured Notes will be
effectively subordinated to any of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ indebtedness that is secured by a senior-priority
lien thereon, including our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, to the extent of the value of the Current Asset
Collateral.

As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had
approximately $1,400.0 million of term loan borrowings outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility, and $175.0
million of borrowings outstanding under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which would have provided for
unused commitments of $325.0 million, respectively (not taking into account the impact of the ING Receivables
Purchasing Agreement remaining outstanding). In addition, the Indentures will permit us to incur substantial
additional indebtedness in the future, including additional secured indebtedness. See “Capitalization.”

**_The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not_**
**_guarantee the Notes._**

Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be guaranteed by Parent and each of its existing and
future wholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that is an obligor under our New Credit Term Loan Agreement,
subject to certain exceptions. Our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes will have no obligation, contingent or
otherwise, to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by
dividend, distribution, loan or other payment. The Notes and the guarantees thereof will be structurally subordinated
to all indebtedness and other obligations of any non-Guarantor subsidiary such that, in the event of insolvency,
liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of any subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, all of that
subsidiary’s creditors (including trade creditors) would be entitled to payment in full out of that subsidiary’s assets
before we would be entitled to any payment from that subsidiary.

66


-----

Certain of our foreign subsidiaries will be co-borrowers or guarantors under our New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility, which entities will not provide guarantees of the Notes. In addition, the Indentures will, subject to
certain limitations, permit non-Guarantor subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and will not contain any
limitation on the amount of certain other liabilities, such as trade payables, that may be incurred by these
subsidiaries.

For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions,
our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 62% of our Net sales and approximately 62% of our Pro
Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. As of fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect
to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 74% of our total assets (excluding
intercompany receivables and investments in subsidiaries) and approximately 19% of our total liabilities (excluding
intercompany payables).

Further, our subsidiaries that provide, or will provide, guarantees of the Notes may be released from those
Notes guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events. If any subsidiary’s Notes guarantee is released, no holder of
the Notes will have a claim as a creditor against that subsidiary, and the indebtedness and other liabilities, including
trade payables and preferred stock, if any, whether secured or unsecured, of that subsidiary will be effectively senior
to the claim of any holders of the Notes. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Brief Description of the Unsecured
Notes— Unsecured Note Guarantees” and “Description of Secured Notes—Brief Description of the Secured
Notes— Secured Note Guarantees.”

**_The lenders under the New Credit Facilities will have the discretion to release the Guarantors under the New_**
**_Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances, which will cause those Guarantors to be released from their_**
**_guarantees of the Notes._**

While any obligations under the New Credit Facilities remain outstanding, any guarantee may be released
without action by, or consent of, any holder of the Notes or the Trustee, if such Guarantor is no longer a borrower or
guarantor of obligations under the New Credit Facilities except by reason of payment under or the termination or
repayment of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or if such release or discharge is by or as a result of payment in
connection with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Brief
Description of the Unsecured Notes—Unsecured Note Guarantees” and “Description of Secured Notes—Brief
Description of the Secured Notes—Secured Note Guarantees.” The lenders under the New Credit Facilities will
have the discretion to release the guarantees under the New Credit Facilities in a variety of circumstances. You will
not have a direct claim as a creditor against any subsidiary that is no longer a Guarantor, and the indebtedness and
other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will be structurally
senior to claims of holders of the Notes.

**_We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer._**

Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change of control events, we will be required to offer to
repurchase all outstanding Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but
excluding, the repurchase date. Additionally, under the New Credit Agreements, a change of control, as defined in
each of the New Credit Agreements, constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to, among other actions,
accelerate the maturity of any outstanding borrowings under the New Credit Facilities and terminate any
commitments to lend. The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under the
New Credit Facilities would be available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources,
including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change
of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon
a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due at such time. We may require additional
financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory
terms or at all. If we fail to repurchase the Notes of any series in that circumstance, we will be in default under the
applicable Indenture.

Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to
repurchase the Notes and events of default and potential breaches of each of the New Credit Agreements, we may
have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

67


-----

In addition, some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations or the sale of our
company to a public company that does not have a majority shareholder, may not, under the Indentures, constitute a
“change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those corporate events could
increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value
of the Notes. See “Description of Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control” and
“Description of Secured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.”

Moreover, in certain circumstances specified in the Indentures, we will be required to commence an asset
sale offer, as defined under the Indentures, pursuant to which we will be obligated to offer to purchase the applicable
Notes at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. See “Description of
Unsecured Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales” and “Description of Secured Notes—
Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.”

The exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require us to repurchase the Notes pursuant to a
change of control offer or asset sale offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other
indebtedness, including future agreements, even if the change of control or asset sale itself does not, due to the
financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a change of control offer or asset sale is required to be made
at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain
such prohibitions. If we do not obtain consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing
the Notes. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an event of default under the
applicable Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness. Finally, our ability to
pay cash to the holders of the Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by our then existing financial resources.

**_Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the_**
**_Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets._**

The definition of “change of control” in the Indentures includes a phrase relating to the sale of “all or
substantially all” of our assets. There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under
applicable law and the judicial interpretation of that phrase will likely depend upon particular facts and
circumstances. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to repurchase such Notes as a result of a
sale, assignment, lease, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of our and our subsidiaries’ assets, taken as a
whole, to another person or group is uncertain. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require us to
repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale of less than all our assets to another person may be uncertain.

**_The Issuer may redeem your Notes at any time, which may adversely affect your return._**

As described under “Description of Unsecured Notes—Optional Redemption” and “Description of Secured
Notes—Optional Redemption,” we have the right to redeem any series of the Notes in whole or in part beginning on
, 2024 at the applicable redemption prices set forth herein.

At any time prior to        , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the
Dollar Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of       % of the
principal amount of the Dollar Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Secured Notes then
outstanding and (y) $   million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Secured Notes remains outstanding (except to
the extent all remaining Dollar Secured Notes of such series are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture).

At any time prior to        , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the Euro
Secured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of       % of the principal
amount of the Euro Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption,
so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Secured Notes then outstanding and
(y) €   million aggregate principal amount of Euro Secured Notes remains outstanding (except to the extent all
remaining Euro Secured Notes of such series are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Indenture).

68


-----

At any time prior to        , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the
Dollar Unsecured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of       % of the
principal amount of the Dollar Unsecured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date
of redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Unsecured Notes
then outstanding and (y) $   million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Unsecured Notes remains outstanding
(except to the extent all remaining Dollar Unsecured Notes of such series are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at
such time in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture).

At any time prior to        , 2024, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the Euro
Unsecured Notes with the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of       % of the principal
amount of the Euro Unsecured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of
redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Unsecured Notes then
outstanding and (y) €   million aggregate principal amount of Euro Unsecured Notes remains outstanding (except
to the extent all remaining Euro Unsecured Notes of such series are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Indenture).

We may also redeem the remaining outstanding Notes of such series in whole or in part in connection with
any tender offer or other offer to purchase such series of Notes (including pursuant to a change of control or asset
sale offer under the Indentures), if not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
purchased by the Issuer, or any third party purchasing or acquiring the Notes in lieu of the Issuer, at the price paid to
holders in such purchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Furthermore, at any time prior to    , 2024, we may
redeem during each calendar year up to 10% of the principal amount of the Secured Notes of each series at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount of the Secured Notes being redeemed, plus accrued interest.
We may choose to exercise these redemption rights when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. As a result, you
may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as
that of the applicable series of Notes.

**_Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or the guarantees_**
**_thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) and, if that occurs, you may not_**
**_receive any payments on the Notes._**

Fraudulent transfer and conveyance laws may apply to the issuance of the Notes and/or the incurrence of
the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes). Under the Bankruptcy Code and
other fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the
Notes or the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) could be avoided as a
fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or any or the Guarantors, as applicable, (a) is determined to have
issued the Notes and/or incurred the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes)
with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or
fair consideration in return for issuing the Notes and/or incurring the guarantees (or the related security interests
with respect to the Secured Notes) and, in the case of clause (b) only, one or more of the following is also true at the
time thereof:

  - the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance
of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured
Notes);

  - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to
the Secured Notes) left the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small
amount of capital or assets to carry on the business engaged in or contemplated;

  - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors intended to, or believed that the Issuer or such Guarantor would, incur
debts beyond the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or

69


-----

  - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for
money damages docketed against the Issuer or the Guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied
after final judgment.

As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or
obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a
Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee (or the related security
interests with respect to the Secured Notes) to the extent the Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent
benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any
guarantee could be subject to the claim that, because the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only
indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than
reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, if a court were to find that the applicable Guarantor
were insolvent or rendered insolvent by the incurrence of the guarantee or one of the other conditions above
(relating to the Guarantor’s financial condition) were satisfied, the court could avoid the obligations under the
guarantees (and the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes), subordinate them to the applicable
guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes, including requiring the return of
prior payments thereon.

Courts in different jurisdictions may measure solvency differently, such that we cannot be certain as to the
standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantors were insolvent at the relevant
time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a Guarantor were
indeed insolvent on that date, that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not
constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds, or whether the Notes or any guarantees
would be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any of the Guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem
an entity insolvent if:

  - the sum of its debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of
its assets;

  - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its
probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they become
absolute and mature; or

  - it could not pay its debts as they became due.

Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit a Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it
could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or
conveyance. This provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect the guarantees from being
avoided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may reduce or eliminate the Guarantor’s obligation to an
amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless.

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee (or the related security
interest with respect to the Secured Notes) was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could avoid the
payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee, could avoid the liens securing the Secured Notes and the
related guarantees, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the
Issuer or of the related Guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with
respect to that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not
receive any repayment on the Notes, or may receive only a partial repayment. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or
the guarantees could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result
in acceleration of that debt.

In addition, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the Notes or by a Guarantor under a guarantee made at a
time the Issuer or such Guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to the
Issuer or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s creditors if such payment is
made to an “insider” within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other party, and

70


-----

such payment would give the recipient thereof more than such party would have received in a distribution under the
Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case, subject to applicable defenses.

Also, no assurance can be given that no party in interest would not challenge any of the transactions in
connection with the Acquisition and the Reorganization as a fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or
otherwise in any insolvency proceedings, or what the outcome of any such challenge would be.

Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the
guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1)
the holder of the Notes or the guarantees engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct
resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the Notes and (3)
equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to each series of Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of such series of Notes. A credit rating is not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the
rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of
time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant, such as adverse changes in our business. A negative change in or an
indication of a possible negative change in any of our ratings could have an adverse effect on the trading and market
price of such series of Notes. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of any credit rating by one or more
of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings or result in
higher borrowing costs. Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive
for us to obtain additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to a series of Notes is subsequently
lowered or withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell such Notes without a substantial discount.

**_A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our_**
**_future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital._**

Our debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or
withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis
of the rating, such as adverse changes in our business, warrant. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our
credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the applicable series of Notes. Credit ratings are not
recommendations to purchase, hold or sell any series of Notes. Additionally, credit ratings may not reflect the
potential effect of risks relating to the structure or marketing of such Notes.

Any future lowering of our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain
additional debt financing. If any credit rating initially assigned to a series of Notes is subsequently lowered or
withdrawn for any reason, you may not be able to resell such Notes without a substantial discount.

**_The Indentures will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply with the_**
**_provisions of the Trust Indenture Act._**

The Indentures will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and we will not be required to comply
with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not be entitled to the benefit of
the provisions and protection of the Trust Indenture Act except to the extent there are similar provisions in the
Indentures.

71


-----

**_Many of the covenants contained in the Indentures will not be applicable during any period when such series of_**
**_Notes are rated investment grade by Moody’s and S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is_**
**_continuing._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indentures will not apply during any period when the Notes are
rated investment grade by Moody’s and S&P and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under
the Indenture. These covenants restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, incur debt and to enter into
certain other transactions. We cannot assure you that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they
are rated investment grade, the Notes will maintain such ratings. However, suspension of these covenants would
allow us to engage in certain actions that would not have been permitted while these covenants were in force, which
actions may conflict with the interests of the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, the effects of any such actions that
we take while these covenants are not in force will be permitted to remain in place even if the Notes are
subsequently downgraded below investment grade and the covenants are reinstated. Any subsequent lowering,
suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the
Notes.

**_Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to registration rights, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes_**
**_under U.S. federal or state securities laws. There are restrictions on your ability to transfer or resell the Notes._**

The Notes are being offered and sold pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
and applicable state securities laws, and we do not currently intend to register the Notes. The holders of the Notes
will not be entitled to require us to register the Notes for resale or otherwise. Therefore, you may transfer or resell
the Notes in the United States only in a transaction registered under or exempt from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, and you may be required to bear the risk of your investment
for an indefinite period of time. See “Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, we will not be subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), and holders of Notes will
only be entitled to receive the information about us specified in “Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain
Covenants— Reports” and “Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants— Reports,” including the
information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**_Your ability to transfer the Notes may be limited by the absence of an active trading market, and an active trading_**
**_market may not develop for the Notes._**

Each series of Notes will be a new issue of securities for which there is no established trading market. We
cannot assure you that an active trading market for the Notes will develop and continue after this offering. The
Issuer does not intend to apply for listing of the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation
system. The Issuer intends to apply to list each series of Euro Notes on the Exchange following the consummation
of this offering. There is no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange,
and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained.
Certain of the initial purchasers of the Notes have advised us that they intend to make a market in each series of
Notes, as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a
market in any series of Notes and, if commenced, may discontinue their market-making activities at any time
without notice.

Therefore, an active market for any series of Notes may not develop or be maintained, which would
adversely affect the market price and liquidity of such series of Notes. In that case, the holders of such series of
Notes may not be able to sell their Notes at a particular time or at a favorable price, if at all. If a trading market were
to develop, future trading prices of the Notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including:

  - the number of holders of Notes;

  - prevailing interest rates;

  - our operating performance and financial condition;

72


-----

  - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them; and

  - the market for similar securities.

Even if an active trading market for a series of the Notes does develop, there is no guarantee that it will
continue. Historically, the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to severe disruptions that have
caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The market, if any, for a series of the
Notes may experience similar disruptions, and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market
or the prices at which you may sell your Notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the Notes may trade
at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes,
our performance and other factors.

**_The Euro Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange, and_**
**_the Issuer is under no obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro Notes._**

Although the Issuer will seek to have the Euro Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange following
the consummation of this offering, the Issuer cannot assure you that the Euro Notes will become or remain listed on
the Official List of the Exchange. The Issuer is under no obligation to maintain the listing of the Euro Notes on the
Official List of Exchange and may cause the Euro Notes to be de-listed in its sole discretion. If the Issuer does not
obtain, or ceases to or maintain, such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, it may seek to obtain and maintain
the listing of the Euro Notes on another stock exchange, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will do so
and the Issuer is under no obligation to do so.

Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Euro Notes as a result of any listing, failure to be
approved for listing or the de-listing of the Euro Notes may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to
sell the Euro Notes. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an
application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

**_We will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and, therefore, will not be required to provide a_**
**_management report of our internal controls._**

Because we will not register the Notes under the Securities Act after this offering, we will not be subject to
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires public companies to have and maintain effective disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure timely disclosure of material information, and have management review the effectiveness
of those controls on a quarterly basis. The Securities Act also requires public companies to have and maintain
effective internal controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and preparation of financial statements, and have management review the effectiveness of those
controls on an annual basis (and have the independent auditor attest to the effectiveness of such internal controls).
We will not be required to comply with these requirements and therefore we might not have procedures comparable
to public companies.

Although we have developed and monitor our internal control over financial reporting, all internal controls
systems, no matter how well-designed, have inherent limitations. In the course of our internal controls evaluation,
we seek to identify data errors or control problems and to confirm that appropriate corrective action, including
process improvements, are being undertaken. The overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor
our internal controls over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary. Our intent in this regard is that
our internal controls over financial reporting will be maintained as dynamic systems that change (including with
improvements and correction) as conditions warrant. Even those systems determined to be effective can provide
only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of changes in
conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls may vary over time. We cannot be certain that our internal control
systems will be adequate or effective in preventing fraud or human error in the future or that new deficiencies of a
material nature will not evolve and which we may be unable to correct. Any failure in the effectiveness of our
internal controls over financial reporting could have a material effect on our financial reporting or cause us to fail to
meet reporting obligations, which could negatively impair our ability to execute our business strategy and have an
adverse impact on the price of the Notes offered hereby.

**_We are not providing all of the information that would be required if this offering were being registered with the_**
**_SEC._**

This offering memorandum does not include all of the information that would be required if we were
registering this offering of the Notes with the SEC. In particular, this offering memorandum does not comply with
SEC requirements regarding the presentation of a ratio of earnings to fixed charges, does not contain certain
executive compensation information that would be required in a registered offering and adjusts certain non-GAAP
financial measures in a manner that may not be permitted in an SEC filing. See “—We may not achieve some or all
of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma
Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies)” and “Use of NonGAAP Financial Measures.” In addition, the pro forma financial information presented herein has not been prepared
in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. See
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” We urge you to consider this factor in
connection with your evaluation of your investment in the Notes.

**_Because each Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee may be reduced to zero or avoided or released under_**
**_certain circumstances, you may not receive any payments from some or all of the Guarantors._**

It is anticipated that the Notes will have the benefit of the guarantees of our direct parent (in the case of the
Secured Notes) and certain of our subsidiaries. However, the guarantees will be limited to the maximum amount that
the Guarantors are permitted to guarantee under applicable law (including under applicable fraudulent transfer or
conveyance laws). As a result, a Guarantor’s liability under a guarantee could be reduced (including to zero)
depending on the limitations and other requirements of applicable law and/or the amount of other obligations of such
entity. Further, under certain circumstances, a court under applicable fraudulent conveyance and transfer statutes or
other applicable laws could avoid the obligations under a guarantee, or subordinate the guarantee to other
obligations of the Guarantor. See “—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid
the Notes and/or the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) and, if
that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” In addition, you will lose the benefit of a particular
guarantee if it is released under certain circumstances described under “Description of Unsecured Notes—Brief
Description of the Unsecured Notes—Unsecured Note Guarantees” and “Description of Secured Notes—Brief
Description of the Secured Notes—Secured Note Guarantees.”

As a result, an entity’s liability under its guarantee, could be materially reduced or eliminated depending
upon the amounts of its other obligations and upon applicable laws. In particular, in certain jurisdictions, a guarantee
granted by a company that is not in the company’s corporate interests or where the burden of that guarantee exceeds
the benefit to the company may not be valid and enforceable. It is possible that the validity and/or enforceability of a
particular entity’s guarantee may be challenged in the case of an insolvency of such entity and that the applicable
court may determine that the guarantee should be limited or avoided.

**_The obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which are_**
**_secured by a portion of the same assets that will secure the Secured Notes, together with any additional secured_**
**_indebtedness permitted to be secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, will be senior to the_**
**_Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral securing such indebtedness on a first-, or_**
**_otherwise senior-, priority basis._**

Obligations of the borrowers under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Issuer and the Guarantors
are secured, subject to certain limitations and exceptions and customary permitted liens, by a first-priority security
interest in the Current Asset Collateral. The Secured Notes and related guarantees will be secured, subject to certain
limitations and exceptions and customary permitted liens, by a second-priority lien on all of such Current Asset
Collateral of the Issuer and the Guarantors of the Secured Notes and will have a first-priority lien on all other assets
of the Issuer and the Guarantors comprising the Fixed Asset Collateral. Subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, the liens on the Current Asset Collateral held by the holders of the Secured Notes will, therefore, be
fully subordinated to the liens on the Current Asset Collateral held by our creditors under the New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility, together with any additional secured indebtedness permitted to be secured by the New ABL
Revolving Credit Facility on a senior-priority basis, to the extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral
securing such indebtedness. Only when our obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, and all other

74


-----

permitted senior-priority indebtedness that is secured by such Current Asset Collateral, are satisfied in full will the
proceeds of such Current Asset Collateral be available, subject to other permitted liens, to satisfy obligations under
the Secured Notes and the related guarantees. Consequently, the Secured Notes and the related guarantees will be
effectively subordinated to the obligations of the Issuer, the other borrowers under the New ABL Revolving Credit
Facility, and the Guarantors and all other permitted first-priority secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of
the Current Asset Collateral. In addition, the Secured Notes Indenture will permit us to incur additional indebtedness
secured by a lien on the Current Asset Collateral that ranks senior to or equally with the Secured Notes. Any such
indebtedness may further limit the recovery from the realization of the value of the Current Asset Collateral
available to satisfy holders of the Secured Notes.

**_We will need to repay or refinance borrowings under the New Credit Facilities prior to maturity of the Notes._**
**_Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon us._**

We expect that our New Credit Facilities will mature prior to, or in the case of the Secured Notes and the
New Term Loan Facility only, concurrently with, the maturity of the Notes offered hereby. As of June 30, 2021, on
a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions (not taking into account the impact of the ING Receivables
Purchasing Agreement remaining outstanding), we would have had approximately $1,400.0 million of term loan
borrowings outstanding under the New Term Loan Facility and $175.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the
New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, with $325.0 million, respectively, of availability. See “Capitalization” and
“Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

Consequently, prior to, or in the case of the Secured Notes and the New Term Loan Facility only,
concurrently with, the maturity of the Notes, we will need to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the
maturity of the New Credit Facilities. Our ability to repay, refinance, replace or extend will be dependent on, among
other things, business conditions, our financial performance and the general condition of the financial markets. If a
financial disruption were to occur at the time that we are required to repay, refinance or replace indebtedness
outstanding under the New Credit Facilities, we could be forced to undertake alternate financings, negotiate for an
extension of the maturity of the New Credit Facilities or sell assets and delay capital expenditures in order to
generate proceeds that could be used to repay indebtedness under the New Credit Facilities. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to consummate any such transaction on terms that are commercially reasonable, on terms
acceptable to us or at all. Our failure to repay, refinance, replace or otherwise extend the maturity of the New Credit
Facilities could result in an event of default under the Indentures and the New Credit Agreements, which could lead
to an acceleration or repayment of substantially all of our outstanding debt.

**_The Indentures governing the Notes and the New Credit Agreements governing the New Credit Facilities will_**
**_contain cross default or cross acceleration provisions that may result in all of the debt issued under the_**
**_Indentures and the New Credit Agreements to become immediately due and payable because of a default under_**
**_an unrelated debt instrument._**

Our failure to comply with the obligations contained in the agreements governing any of our debt
instruments could result in an event of default under such instruments, which could result in the Notes and the New
Credit Facilities (together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees) becoming immediately due and payable.
In such event, we would need to raise funds from alternative sources, which funds may not be available to us on
favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. Alternatively, such a default could require us to sell our assets and
otherwise curtail our operations in order to pay our creditors. These alternative measures could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows, which could cause us to
become bankrupt or insolvent or otherwise impair the ability of the subsidiaries of Parent to make cash available to
the Issuer by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise to enable the Issuer to make payments in respect of its
indebtedness, including the Notes.

**_The rights of holders of Secured Notes in the Current Asset Collateral may be adversely affected by the ABL_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement._**

Under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the liens on the Current Asset Collateral securing the
obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other
obligations permitted to be secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, will rank senior to the

75


-----

liens on such Current Asset Collateral securing our and the guarantors’ obligations under the Secured Notes and the
related guarantees. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement also provides that the obligations under the New ABL
Revolving Credit Facility (or any replacement facilities), together with any other obligations permitted to be secured
by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis (including post-petition interest, fees and expenses, whether
or not allowed or allowable in any bankruptcy case), will be paid with the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral
prior to the obligations under the Secured Notes and related guarantees in certain circumstances, including in the
event of any foreclosure by the lenders under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event. The
lenders under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, as holders of first-priority liens on the Current Asset
Collateral, will (at all times prior to the expiration of a 180-day standstill period which period would be extended if
the lenders under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility had commenced and were diligently pursuing any
enforcement action with respect to all or any material portion of the Current Asset Collateral or are stayed under
applicable law from exercising such rights and remedies) control substantially all enforcement matters related to
such Current Asset Collateral, pursuant to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The holders of the
permitted first- priority liens on the Current Asset Collateral, including under the New ABL Revolving Credit
Facility, may cause the ABL Collateral Agent to dispose of, release, or foreclose on, or take other actions with
respect to, the Current Asset Collateral (including certain amendments of and waivers under the security documents
with respect thereto) with which holders of the Secured Notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests
of holders of the Secured Notes, even after a default under the Secured Notes in the case of an enforcement action
by the ABL Collateral Agent.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will (at all times prior to the expiration of a 180-day standstill period,
which may potentially be extended in the manner set forth above) prohibit parties with second-priority liens on the
Current Asset Collateral, including the holders of the Secured Notes, from foreclosing on such collateral at any time
prior to the payment in full of the permitted obligations secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority
basis, including all obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility. To the extent the Current Asset
Collateral is released from securing the obligations secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis,
including all obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that, in certain circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the agent under the
New ABL Revolving Credit Facility or in connection with a sale or other disposition of the Current Asset Collateral
permitted under the terms of both the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture), the
second-priority liens securing the Secured Notes in the Current Asset Collateral will automatically also be released.
In addition, the Secured Notes Indenture and the security documents related to the holders of Secured Notes’
second-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms
of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent
party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral until
such first-priority lien obligations are paid in full, and the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the security
documents related to the first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral securing the obligations under the New
ABL Revolving Credit Facility may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreements without the consent of the Secured Notes Collateral Agent. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further
provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the Secured Notes would be required to turn over to the
holders of obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility amounts they receive from the Issuer with
respect to the Current Asset Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders of the
obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of the
Current Asset Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the Secured Notes
after payment in full of the obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the Current Asset Collateral, including
all obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Secured Notes—Security—
Intercreditor Arrangements.”

In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the New ABL
Revolving Credit Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of Current Asset Collateral or our
obtaining debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing that is secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, the
holders of the Secured Notes would (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to
their liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) agree not to
raise objections to such use of cash collateral or DIP financing, and the holders of the Secured Notes would also
agree to having their liens on the Current Asset Collateral be subordinated to the liens thereon securing such DIP
financing or providing adequate protection to the lenders under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility. The ABL

76


-----

Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the holders of the Secured Notes to raise various other objections
or take various other actions in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Current Asset Collateral
prior to the payment in full of the obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, including, among other
things, seeking relief from the “automatic stay” with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, and will also place
certain restrictions on their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the Current Asset Collateral from
a bankruptcy court, even if such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were being affected.

**_Even though the holders of the Secured Notes will benefit from a first-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral,_**
**_the Term Loan Collateral Agent will initially control actions with respect to the Collateral._**

The rights of the holders of the Secured Notes with respect to the Collateral will also be subject to the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement among all holders of obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a firstpriority basis, including the obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement. Under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset
Collateral, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Collateral by any such holders, including the ability to
cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be
at the exclusive direction of the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the date on which our obligations
under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement (or any refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) are no longer
secured pursuant to the terms of the documents governing the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or (2) 180-days
after the occurrence of an event of default under any agreement governing obligations secured by the Fixed Asset
Collateral on a first priority basis that constitutes the largest series of all obligations subject to the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement (solely to the extent that such series of obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount
than the obligations under our New Term Loan Credit Agreement then outstanding), is not stayed from pursuing any
such exercise pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that is continuing and acceleration of such series of
obligations, so long as the Term Loan Collateral Agent has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to
Collateral or none of the Issuer or the Guarantors is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to)
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to our New Term Loan
Credit Agreement, at which time the parties to our New Term Loan Credit Agreement will no longer have the
exclusive right to direct the actions with respect to the collateral securing the Secured Notes pursuant to the Pari
Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct such actions will pass to the collateral agent of holders of the then
largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by first priority liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral. If
we issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing our Secured Notes in the future in a
greater principal amount than the Secured Notes, then the collateral agent for such additional indebtedness would be
next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent
for the Secured Notes. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and
take other actions with respect to the Collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement, if at any time the controlling fixed asset collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies
against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Secured Notes on such collateral will be
automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the
then outstanding first priority obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the Fixed Asset Collateral). The
Collateral so released will no longer secure our and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Secured Notes and the
guarantees. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy filing, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will impose
limitations on the holders of the Secured Notes with respect to their rights to object to proposed DIP financing or the
use of cash collateral or to the liens securing such DIP financing that has been consented to by the lenders under the
New Term Loan Credit Agreement and that satisfy certain terms and conditions.

Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Secured Notes
obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time
prior to the discharge of each of the other obligations secured by first-priority liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral,
then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of
such first-priority obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the
controlling collateral agent under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, to be distributed (subject to
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral), in accordance with the provisions of
such agreement among all the holders of obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis.
See “Description of Secured Notes—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents entered_**
**_into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to the creation_**
**_and priority of liens in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, will give it, in many cases, as a matter_**
**_of law, second priority to the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent. In such cases, holders of the Secured Notes will_**
**_have to rely on the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to obtain the benefit of senior priority liens on the Fixed Asset_**
**_Collateral subject to applicable law in such local jurisdictions, as the case may be._**

The lien of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral will be created pursuant to security documents
entered into with the Notes Collateral Agent and perfected in a manner that, under the laws applicable to the creation
and priority of collateral in the jurisdictions in which the Collateral is pledged, will give it, in many cases, as a
matter of law, second-priority to the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent. As a result, the enforceability of the firstpriority lien of the holders of the Notes with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral may be dependent on the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that the rights of the holders of the Secured Notes with respect to the Fixed
Asset Collateral are secured on a first-priority basis and to which the ABL Collateral Agent will be a party.

**_The value of the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the_**
**_Secured Notes and the other obligations secured by an equal and ratable lien on the Collateral or a senior lien on_**
**_the Current Asset Collateral._**

The Secured Notes and the related guarantees will be secured, subject to certain limitations and exceptions
and customary permitted liens, by a second-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral of the Issuer and the
guarantors of the Secured Notes and a first-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral. No appraisal of the value of
the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to
fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of industries in which we operate, the ability
to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received
upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair
market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By
their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the
event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely,
orderly or value-maximizing manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be
sufficient to pay our obligations under the Secured Notes, in full or at all, after first satisfying in full (from the
Current Asset Collateral) our obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility that are secured by a firstpriority lien on the Current Asset Collateral and after taking into account the pari passu obligations under our New
Term Loan Credit Agreement. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of
time (or at all) in an orderly manner. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber
assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to
the property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Secured
Notes Collateral Agent acting for the benefit of itself, the Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of the Secured Notes
to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the
amounts due on the Secured Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of
the Secured Notes from the sale of the Collateral and any unpaid obligations under the Secured Notes will rank
equally in right of payment with any claim of all of our other senior unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness,
including the Unsecured Notes and trade payables, against our and our Guarantors’ remaining assets. Moreover, the
lenders under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and any other obligation secured by pari passu liens will share
the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the holders of the Secured Notes, thereby diluting the collateral coverage.
The Collateral may also secure additional pari passu indebtedness that we may incur in the future. Your rights to the
Collateral would be further diluted by an increase in the additional pari passu indebtedness secured by the
Collateral.

In addition, as described further below, in the event that an insolvency or liquidation proceeding is
commenced by or against us, if the value of the Collateral is less than the amount of principal and accrued and
unpaid interest on the Secured Notes and all other obligations that are secured by liens that are (as applicable) pari
_passu with the liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes or senior to the liens securing the Secured Notes_
on the Current Asset Collateral, the holders of the Secured Notes would not be entitled to a claim for any interest,
fees and expenses that accrued on the Secured Notes on or after the date the bankruptcy petition is filed. In addition,
the holders of the Secured Notes would not be entitled to “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws with

78


-----

respect to any undersecured, deficiency portion of the Secured Notes existing as of the commencement of the
bankruptcy proceeding. See “—Rights of holders of Secured Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by
United States bankruptcy proceedings and holders of the Secured Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest,
fees or expenses in any United States bankruptcy proceeding.”

**_The imposition of certain permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral and in_**
**_certain cases will cause the asset on which such liens are imposed to be excluded from the Collateral. There are_**
**_also certain other categories of property that are similarly excluded from the Collateral._**

The Collateral may be subject to liens permitted under the terms of the Secured Notes Indenture. The
existence of any permitted liens could materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral that could be realized
by the holders of the Secured Notes as well as the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose on the
Collateral. In addition, the imposition of certain permitted liens may cause the relevant assets to become “excluded
assets,” which will not secure the Secured Notes or the related guarantees.

In addition, the Secured Notes Indenture will permit liens in favor of third parties to secure purchase money
indebtedness and capital lease obligations, and any assets subject to such liens may be automatically excluded from
the Collateral where the agreement governing such indebtedness or obligation prohibits the grant of a lien on such
assets to the Notes Collateral Agent. Our ability to incur purchase money indebtedness and capital lease obligations
is subject to limitations, as described in “Description of Unsecured Notes—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and “Description of Secured Notes—Certain
Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.” Other categories of
excluded assets and property under the Secured Notes Indenture include, among others, real property owned below a
value threshold, certain future acquired owned real property below a value threshold and leased real property,
certain contracts, letter of credit rights and commercial tort claims below a threshold and equity and assets of
unrestricted subsidiaries and immaterial subsidiaries. See “Description of Secured Notes—Security—Collateral.”
Excluded assets will not be available as Collateral to secure our and the guarantors’ obligations under the Secured
Notes. As a result, with respect to the excluded assets, the Secured Notes and the related guarantees will effectively
rank equally with any other unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, including the Unsecured
Notes, that is not secured by the excluded assets.

**_Security interests over certain of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the Secured Notes are_**
**_issued. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the granting or perfecting of such security_**
**_interests may impact the value of the Collateral. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the_**
**_issuance of the Secured Notes increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests could be avoided_**
**_in bankruptcy._**

Certain security interests in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent may not be in place by the time the Secured
Notes are issued. To the extent any liens on or security interest in the Collateral are not perfected on or prior to the
issuance of the Secured Notes, we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to have all such security interests
perfected promptly following the issuance of the Secured Notes and, in any event, within 90 days thereof.
Additionally, certain filings and other actions required for perfection of the liens on Collateral, prior to, on and after
the date of the issuance of the Secured Notes may be delayed, or not completed at all, as a result of the occurrence of
the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of any applicable registration system, filing offices or related service
not being available. Any issues that we are unable to resolve in connection with the delivery and recordation of such
security interests may negatively impact the value of the Collateral. To the extent a security interest in certain of the
Collateral is perfected following the issuance of the Secured Notes, any such security interest that is granted within
90 days (or in some cases, potentially a year) of a bankruptcy filing would be at risk of being avoided or voided as a
preferential transfer by the pledgor, as debtor in possession, by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by our other
creditors, which could impact the value of the Collateral, even after the security interests perfected on the issuance
date of the Secured Notes were no longer subject to such risk. If any such security interest is so avoided, you could
also be required to return any payments received on account thereof.

**_Lien searches may not reveal all liens on the collateral._**

We cannot guarantee that lien searches on the Collateral that will secure the Secured Notes and guarantees
thereof will reveal any or all existing liens on such Collateral. Any such existing lien, including undiscovered liens,
could be significant, could be prior in ranking to the liens securing the notes and guarantees thereof and could have
an adverse effect on the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to realize or foreclose upon the Collateral securing the
Secured Notes and guarantees thereof.

**_The Collateral is subject to casualty risks._**

We believe we maintain insurance or otherwise insure against hazards in a manner appropriate and
customary for our business. There are, however, certain losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically
insurable, in whole or in part. Insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a complete
or partial loss of any of the Collateral, the insurance proceeds may not be sufficient to satisfy all of the secured
obligations, including the Secured Notes and the related guarantees. In the event of a total or partial loss to any of
our facilities, certain items of equipment may not be easily replaced.

**_We will in most cases have control over the Collateral, and the sale of particular assets by us could reduce the_**
**_pool of assets securing the Secured Notes and any future guarantees of the Secured Notes._**

Subject to the terms of the New Credit Agreements, the Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreements and the security documents governing the Collateral will allow us to remain in possession of, retain
exclusive control over, freely operate and collect, invest and dispose of any income from, the Collateral. For
example, so long as no default or event of default under the Secured Notes Indenture would result therefrom, we
may, among other things, without any release or consent by the Secured Notes Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring, abandoning or
otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments (including repayments of
indebtedness). See “Description of Secured Notes.”

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Secured Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_could be released automatically without the consent of the holders of the Secured Notes, which could be adverse_**
**_to holders of the Secured Notes._**

Under various circumstances, all or a portion of the Collateral and the related Guarantors may be released,
including (among others):

  - to enable the sale, transfer or other disposal of such Collateral in a transaction not prohibited under the
Secured Notes Indenture (other than to the Issuer or any guarantor), including the sale of any entity in its
entirety that owns or holds such Collateral;

  - with respect to Collateral held by a guarantor, upon the release of such guarantor from its guarantee; and

  - pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreements.

The guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor will be released in connection with a sale of such subsidiary
guarantor in a transaction not prohibited by the Secured Notes Indenture. The Secured Notes Indenture will also
permit us to designate one or more of our restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor of the Secured Notes as an
unrestricted subsidiary. If we designate a subsidiary guarantor as an unrestricted subsidiary, all of the liens in favor
of the holders of the Secured Notes on any Collateral owned by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries and any
guarantees of the Secured Notes by such subsidiary or any of its subsidiaries will be released under the Secured
Notes Indenture. Designation as an unrestricted subsidiary will reduce the aggregate value of the Collateral to the
extent that liens on the assets of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries are released. In addition, the creditors
of the unrestricted subsidiary and its subsidiaries will have a senior claim on the assets of such unrestricted
subsidiary and its subsidiaries and the holders of the Notes will have no claim to such assets. See “Description of
Secured Notes—Security—Release of Collateral,” “Description of Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—

80


-----

Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries” and “Description of Secured Notes—Brief
Description of the Secured Notes—Secured Note Guarantees.”

**_If the Guarantees are released as a result of such Notes having investment grade ratings from Moody’s and S&P_**
**_and there is no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture, the Notes will no longer have the_**
**_benefit of any Guarantees, unless such Notes subsequently have a lower than investment grade rating from either_**
**_Moody’s or S&P._**

If the Guarantees are released as a result of such Notes having investment grade ratings from Moody’s
and S&P and there is no default or event of default under the applicable Indenture, such Notes will no longer have
the benefit of any Guarantees and no further Guarantees will be granted and, in the case of the Secured Notes, shall
no longer have the benefit of the related Collateral of such Guarantors, in each case unless such Notes subsequently
have a lower than investment grade rating from either Moody’s or S&P.

**_Certain laws and regulations may impose restrictions or limitations on foreclosure._**

Our obligations under the Secured Notes are secured only by the Collateral described in this offering
memorandum. The ability of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose on the Collateral on behalf of the holders of
Secured Notes may be subject to perfection, priority issues, state law requirements and practical problems associated
with the realization of the security interest or lien in the Collateral of the Notes Collateral Agent, including cure
rights, foreclosing on the Collateral within the time periods permitted by third parties or prescribed by laws,
obtaining third-party consents, making additional filings, statutory rights of redemption and the effect of the order of
foreclosure. We cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties and approvals by governmental entities will
be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Therefore, we cannot assure you that foreclosure
on the Collateral will be sufficient to make all payments on the Secured Notes.

The holders of the Secured Notes and the Secured Notes Trustee also may be limited in their ability to
enforce a breach of the “limitation on liens” covenant. Some decisions of state courts have placed limits on a
lender’s ability to accelerate debt secured by real property upon breach of covenants prohibiting the creation of
certain junior liens or leasehold estates, and a lender may need to demonstrate that enforcement is reasonably
necessary to protect against impairment of the lender’s security or to protect against an increased risk of default.
Although the foregoing court decisions may have been preempted, at least in part, by certain federal laws, the scope
of such preemption, if any, is uncertain. Accordingly, a court could prevent the Secured Notes Trustee and the
holders of the Secured Notes from declaring a default and accelerating the Secured Notes by reason of a breach of
this covenant, which could have a material adverse effect on the ability of holders to enforce the covenant.

**_Rights of holders of the Secured Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect liens_**
**_on certain Collateral._**

Applicable law requires that a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected and its priority retained through the taking of certain actions. The liens on the Collateral from time to time
owned by us securing obligations under the Secured Notes may not be perfected if we have not taken the actions
necessary to perfect any of those liens. Our inability or failure to promptly take all actions necessary to create
properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the
perfection of the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Notes to which they would have been
otherwise entitled. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a
general security interest, such as real property, and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property
and rights are acquired and identified. Furthermore, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent in the
Collateral may not be in place on the date that the Secured Notes are issued. Although, under the Secured Notes
Indenture and the security documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors are required to use commercially reasonable
efforts to grant the security interest to the Notes Collateral Agent, no assurance can be given that such security
interest will be granted or perfected on a timely basis.

The Secured Notes Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will not be required to monitor, and we may not
inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute
Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken by us to properly perfect the security interest in such after
81


-----

acquired Collateral. Neither the Secured Notes Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor
the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any
filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Secured Notes against third
parties. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in
favor of the Secured Notes against third parties. In addition, as described further herein, even if liens on Collateral
acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any
bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances. See “—Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee of the
applicable Notes issued in the future might be avoidable in United States bankruptcy proceedings.”

Additionally, the Secured Notes Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the
offering of the Secured Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection
or priority of the liens of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Notes, the Notes
Collateral Agent and the Secured Notes Trustee, including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and
securities accounts. As a result of these limitations, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit
of the holders of the Secured Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Secured Notes Trustee in a portion of the
Collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be subject to other liens) under applicable law. To the extent
that a security interest in this Collateral is unperfected, in a bankruptcy the holders of the Secured Notes may not
have greater rights to such Collateral than would our general unsecured creditors (including the holders of the
Unsecured Notes).

**_Any future pledge of Collateral or any guarantee of the applicable Notes issued in the future might be avoidable_**
**_in United States bankruptcy proceedings._**

Any future pledge of Collateral in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, including pursuant to security
documents delivered after the issuance of the Secured Notes, or any guarantees of any of the Notes issued in the
future, might be avoidable (as a preferential transfer or otherwise) by the pledgor or guarantor (as debtor in
possession) or by its trustee in bankruptcy (or potentially by our other creditors) if certain events or circumstances
exist or occur, including (subject to any applicable defenses) if the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of
the pledge or guarantee, the pledge or guarantee permits the holders of the applicable Notes to receive a greater
recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation of the pledgor than if the pledge or guarantee had not been given,
and a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the
pledge or issuance of the guarantee, or, in certain circumstances, one year. Thus, in any bankruptcy proceedings
commenced within 90 days of lien perfection (or potentially one year for any “insiders”) or the issuance of a
guarantee, a lien given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially
more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the
Acquisition Closing Date (or within a 30-day statutory safe harbor). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file
for bankruptcy protection after the Notes are issued and, in the case of the Secured Notes, a lien granted after such
date had been perfected, or, in the case of any of the Notes, a guarantee issued, less than 90 days before the
commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the applicable Notes
may be particularly subject to challenge and avoidance as a result of having been delivered after the date on which
the applicable series of Notes were issued. To the extent that the grant of any security interest or a guarantee is
avoided as a preference or otherwise, you would lose the benefit of the security interest or guarantee and could be
required to return payments previously received related thereto.

**_Rights of holders of Secured Notes in the Collateral may be adversely affected by United States bankruptcy_**
**_proceedings and holders of the Secured Notes may not be entitled to post-petition interest, fees or expenses in any_**
**_United States bankruptcy proceeding._**

The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an
event of default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by bankruptcy law if bankruptcy
proceedings are commenced by or against us prior to or possibly even after the Notes Collateral Agent has
repossessed and disposed of the Collateral. Under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors, including the Notes Collateral
Agent, are prohibited from taking various actions in furtherance of debt collection, including repossessing their
security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor or
any other collateral, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances
and/or could be materially delayed). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use

82


-----

collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents, or profits of the collateral, even if the debtor
is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor with an interest in such
collateral is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the
circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral at
the time of the bankruptcy filing and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement
security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral
as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of
the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for
diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad
discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, as well as due to the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate
protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Secured Notes could be made following
the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the
Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the
bankruptcy petition or at any relevant time thereafter or whether or to what extent holders of the Secured Notes
would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of
“adequate protection” or otherwise.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreements will provide that so long as any obligations under the New Credit
Agreements are outstanding, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the Secured Notes will be subject to certain
restrictions with respect to their ability to object to various motions or seek other relief with respect to the Collateral
on a number of important matters. In particular, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also prohibit the holders of
the Secured Notes from proposing, voting for, or otherwise directly or indirectly supporting any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, and the holders of the Secured Notes may under certain circumstances be required
to turn over amounts and/or distributions they may receive in respect of the Current Asset Collateral to the holders
of obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “—The rights of holders of Secured Notes in the
Current Asset Collateral may be adversely affected by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement.” Also, the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the holders of the Secured Notes with respect to their rights to
object to proposed DIP financing or the use of cash collateral that has been consented to by the lenders under the
New Term Loan Credit Agreement and that satisfy certain terms and conditions. See “Description of Secured
Notes—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a bankruptcy
filing, the value of the Collateral securing the Secured Notes could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the
Secured Notes may be unable to raise various objections or take other actions. The right of the holders of the
obligations under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility to foreclose upon and sell the Current Asset Collateral or
of the holders of the obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement to foreclose upon and sell the Fixed
Asset Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default also would be subject to limitations under applicable
bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding.

Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient
to repay all amounts due on the Secured Notes (after taking into account all other obligations that are secured by
liens that are either pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the Secured Notes on the various components of
the Collateral), the holders of the Secured Notes would have “undersecured deficiency claims” as to the difference.
Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post- petition interest, costs, expenses, and
attorneys’ fees to the holders of “undersecured claims” (or of unsecured claims, such as those under the Unsecured
Notes) during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would
include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws
with respect to the unsecured, deficiency portion of the Secured Notes. The Unsecured Notes would not be entitled
to adequate protection. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made prior to or at the time of
such a finding of under-collateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a
reduction of the principal amount of the Secured Notes.

As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to limit the ability of the holders of the Secured Notes to realize upon
the Collateral and to receive post-bankruptcy interest, fees, expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any
unsecured, deficiency portion of the Secured Notes.

**_In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of_**
**_certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not_**
**_obtain the return you expect on the applicable series of Notes._**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. The Issuer will deposit (or
cause to be deposited) the proceeds of this offering into an escrow account for the benefit of the holders of the
applicable Notes.

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Acquisition Outside Date,
the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each
series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in
an investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase any Notes at a price greater than the issue
price of such notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Although we currently believe that all conditions to
the Acquisition will be satisfied and expect to consummate the Acquisition before the deadline for the special
mandatory redemption, we cannot assure you that the conditions will be satisfied or waived, that we will in fact
close the Acquisition on substantially the terms described in this offering memorandum or that the Issuer will not
otherwise have to redeem the Notes. Many of the conditions to the closing of the Acquisition are not within our
control, and we cannot predict when or if these conditions will be satisfied. If for any reason we believe that the
Acquisition will not close before the deadline for a special mandatory redemption, we have the option to redeem the
Notes earlier on the same terms.

Additionally, the escrowed funds in the escrow account will be limited to the gross proceeds from this
offering of the Notes, together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash
to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory
redemption.

**_Purchasers of the Notes in this offering will not know, at the time they agree to purchase Notes, whether or not_**
**_this offering will be funded into escrow._**

This offering is not conditioned on the consummation of the Acquisition, and there can be no assurance that
the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms described in this offering memorandum or at all. If Acquisition is
not consummated substantially concurrently with the consummation of this offering, the gross proceeds of this
offering will be deposited into a segregated escrow account on the Issue Date and will be held as collateral security
for the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Notes during the escrow period.

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the consummation of the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction
of a number of conditions precedent. The pricing of this offering of the Notes is expected to occur before we know
whether all conditions to the consummation of the Acquisition have been satisfied. As a result, purchasers of Notes
in this offering will not know, at the time they agree to purchase notes, whether or not this offering will be funded
into escrow.

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will be obligations solely of the_**
**_Issuer until the consummation of the Acquisition._**

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition and the proceeds of the Notes are
deposited into the applicable escrow accounts, prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, holders of the Notes
will not have any recourse to Solenis, the Guarantors or any of their respective subsidiaries, and the Notes will be
the obligations solely of the Issuer, secured by a first-priority security interest in the funds held in the applicable
escrow account. The Issuer is a limited purpose entity and does not hold or otherwise have any interest in any
material assets other than the escrow account. As a result, the sole recourse of the holders prior to the consummation
of the Acquisition will be to the funds deposited in the applicable escrow account.

84


-----

In addition, in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, the Issuer will be relying solely on the Equity Commitment Letter
under which such affiliate of Platinum will agree to transfer an amount in cash to the Issuer sufficient to fund the
accrued and unpaid interest owing to holders of the Notes.

**_Prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, if we became subject to bankruptcy proceedings, the escrowed_**
**_funds might be deemed to be property of the bankruptcy estate, and the holders of the Notes might become_**
**_unsecured creditors._**

If we commence a bankruptcy or reorganization case in the United States, or one is commenced against us,
U.S. bankruptcy law may prevent the Trustee under the applicable Indenture from using the escrowed funds to fund
the special mandatory redemption. The court adjudicating our bankruptcy or reorganization case might find that the
escrowed funds are property of our bankruptcy estate. If it makes such a determination, the court could authorize the
use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without
restrictions, and the Trustee would be prohibited from using or disposing of these funds. Although the Issuer will
grant a first-priority lien on the escrowed funds in favor of the applicable Trustee and the holders of the applicable
series of Notes, unless otherwise provided with protections in connection with such use, the holders of the Notes
could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate by virtue of the Issuer utilizing the escrowed funds
during the bankruptcy or reorganization case thereby dissipating the collateral of the holders of the Notes. Under
applicable bankruptcy law, creditors, including the holders of the Notes while the funds are held in escrow, are
prohibited from foreclosing upon or disposing of a debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval (which
may not be given under the circumstances). As a result, the holders of the Notes may not be able to have the
escrowed funds applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the Indentures and could suffer a loss. See
“Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of
Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

In addition, even if the bankruptcy court recognizes that the holder of Notes are secured creditors with a
first-priority lien on the escrowed funds, it could nevertheless permit the use of the escrowed funds in exchange for
“adequate protection” of the holders’ interest in such funds. It is not clear what adequate protection, if any, the
bankruptcy court might require, but it is possible that the bankruptcy court could allow the use of the escrowed
funds and provide the holders with adequate protection that may not be as valuable as the escrowed funds, such as
replacement liens on different and less liquid collateral.

**_If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, between the time of the issuance of the Notes_**
**_and the consummation of the Acquisition, the parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to modify or waive_**
**_the terms or conditions of such document without the consent of the holders of the Notes._**

The parties to the Acquisition Agreement may agree to amendments or waivers of, or consents to
departures or deviations from, the terms thereof, and holders of the Notes will not have the ability to veto any such
actions. The Escrow Agreement will not preclude the transaction parties from making such modifications or
waivers, and such modifications or waivers will not be made in consultation with the Trustee, the Escrow Agent, the
initial purchasers or holders of the Notes. In addition, your decision to invest in the Notes will be made prior to the
consummation of the Acquisition, and completion of the certain closing conditions stated in the Acquisition
Agreement, and consequently you will not be afforded protection with respect to changes in the business or financial
condition of the acquired business following the closing of this offering that would have a material adverse effect on
our business. Although no such amendment, waiver or consent is presently contemplated, if the parties to the
Acquisition Agreement decide to make changes to the terms thereof (including to the purchase price) or to waive
conditions thereunder, the holders of the Notes will not be able to prevent the release of the escrowed property to
fund the Acquisition as a result of any such action and will not have any veto or consent rights in respect of any such
actions.

85


-----

**_If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied,_**
**_the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of default under the_**
**_Indentures has or would have occurred and is continuing._**

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow and utilized as described under “Use of Proceeds” upon
the Issuer’s delivery to the Escrow Agent of an officer’s certificate stating that the conditions to the release of the
proceeds from escrow have been satisfied. The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the
Acquisition and Reorganization even if a default or event of default under the Indentures has occurred and is
continuing.

**_Following the Transactions, we will be controlled by Platinum. The interests of Platinum, as equity holder, may_**
**_conflict with yours as a creditor._**

Immediately following the Transactions, Platinum will control our indirect parent company’s equity and,
accordingly, will have the ability to control our policies and operations. Platinum will not have any liability for any
obligations under the Notes, and its interests may not be aligned with your interests. For example, if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of our equity holder might conflict
with your interests as a noteholder. In addition, Platinum may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures,
financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance its equity investments, even though such
transactions might involve risks to you as a noteholder. Furthermore, Platinum may in the future own equity or debt
interests in entities that directly or indirectly compete with us. Platinum also may pursue acquisition opportunities
that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to
us. So long as Platinum continues to beneficially own a significant amount of our equity, even if such amount is less
than 50%, it will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisions. Because our equity
securities are not registered under the securities laws of the United States or in any other jurisdiction and are not
listed on any U.S. securities exchange, we are not subject to any of the corporate governance requirements of U.S.
securities authorities or U.S. securities exchanges. For information concerning our arrangements with Platinum
following the Transactions, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

**The Acquisition and Reorganization**

On July 3, 2021, the Sellers, Solenis UK International and Parent entered into the Acquisition Agreement
(which was amended and restated on September 4, 2021), pursuant to which the Solenis business will be acquired by
Parent through the acquisition, by the subsidiaries of Parent, of the Solenis group companies identified in the
Acquisition Agreement as the companies to be acquired pursuant to the Alternative Transaction Structure (as
defined therein), for an aggregate purchase price equal to $5.25 billion, subject to certain adjustments related to
retained capital leases, pension and other liabilities, tax adjustments and other fees. As part of the Acquisition, it is
intended that Solenis Technologies Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (“Solenis Mexico”) will be acquired and form part of
the combined company. Affiliates of the Issuer have applied for antitrust approval in Mexico in relation to the
acquisition of Solenis Mexico (“Mexican Approval”). If Mexican Approval is obtained on or prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, it is expected that Solenis Mexico will be acquired on the Acquisition Closing Date. If Mexican
Approval is not obtained by the Acquisition Closing Date, we may agree to initially acquire the combined company
without Solenis Mexico and delay the acquisition of Solenis Mexico until Mexican Approval is obtained. Solenis
Mexico represented approximately 2.9% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021.

We expect the purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through:

      - borrowings under the New Credit Facilities;

      - proceeds of the Notes offered hereby; and

      - the Equity Investment.

For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” “Description of New Credit
Facilities and Other Indebtedness,” “Description of Unsecured Notes” and “Description of Secured Notes.”

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others, (i)
the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals or lapse of certain review periods with respect thereto, (ii) the
absence of a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial condition of
Solenis and its subsidiaries, (iii) the accuracy of representations and warranties (subject to certain materiality
qualifiers), (iv) material compliance with covenants contained in the Acquisition Agreement and (v) the absence of
any law or order (U.S. or foreign) making illegal the consummation of the Acquisition. We currently expect to
receive final approvals and for the consummation of the Acquisition to occur in the third calendar quarter of 2021.
However, there can be no guarantee that we will receive the requisite approvals within this time frame or at all.
Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is expected to close two (2) business days after
all of the requisite closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, unless otherwise agreed.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights of the Sellers and Parent, including the right
to terminate if the Acquisition has not been consummated by the Acquisition Outside Date. The Acquisition
Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The representations and warranties
do not survive the consummation of the Acquisition, and we therefore will have no post-closing contractual
indemnification from the Sellers for any breaches of representations or warranties. Parent intends to purchase
representation and warranty insurance to mitigate some of this risk.

Concurrently with the Acquisition, pursuant to a transaction agreement, dated as of July 3, 2021 (the
“Transaction Agreement”), Platinum and certain of its affiliates will, following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, contribute to Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership, all of the shares of common stock of IWC Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, which represent all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of IWC Holding Corporation, in
exchange for newly issued units in Olympus Water Holding I, L.P., having a value equal to the contributed shares of

87


-----

IWC Holding Corporation, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately be contributed to each
of Olympus Water Holding II, L.P., and to Olympus Water Holding III, L.P., and to Olympus Water Holding IV,
L.P. and to the Issuer, with the result that IWC Holding Corporation will be held as a subsidiary of the Issuer. The
Reorganization implies a rollover of existing equity interests of the Sponsor and certain of its affiliates in Sigura of
$500 million. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**The Offering, Escrow and Escrow Release**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds
from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be secured by a firstpriority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments therein. The Escrow
Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Assuming the Escrow Release Conditions have been
satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Guarantors will become parties to the Indentures pursuant to one or
more supplemental indentures, and the obligations will become obligations of the Guarantors.

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event
of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indentures. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release
Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of
default under the Indentures has or would have occurred and is continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Acquisition Outside Date,
the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each
series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of
such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special
mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness— In the event that the
Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the
Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect
on the applicable series of Notes.” The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the
Notes, together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any
accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. An
affiliate of Platinum will issue the Equity Commitment Letter to the Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow
Agent and the holders of the Notes, to transfer to the Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of accrued and
unpaid interest on the Notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and expenses.

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will
not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see “Description
of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of Secured Notes—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**The Refinancing**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and the Reorganization and, if applicable, the satisfaction
of the Escrow Release Conditions, we will consummate the Refinancing using the proceeds from the Notes, the
Equity Investment and the New Credit Facilities.

88


-----

**The New Credit Facilities**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow Release
Conditions, the Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into the New Term Loan Credit Agreement providing for the
New Term Loan Facility and will enter into the New ABL Credit Agreement providing for the New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility. See “Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

**Equity Investment**

As part of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will fund the Equity Investment of approximately $1,993 million in
cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately be contributed
to each of the Issuer and to Olympus Water UK Holdings Ltd as common equity, and which will be used as part of
the consideration to be paid in connection with the Acquisition.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The following table summarizes the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions. The amounts and assumed sources set forth in the table and the accompanying footnotes may vary
from actual amounts on the Acquisition Closing Date depending on several factors, including, without limitation,
amounts outstanding under the Solenis Existing Credit Agreements and/or the Sigura Existing Credit Agreements,
cash generated in our business, the sizes and permitted uses of the New Credit Facilities, the actual amount of
purchase price adjustments and fees and expenses, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the actual
amount we draw on the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility upon the closing of the Transactions. If this offering
closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds from the sale of the Notes into segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and, upon
the release of the funds from the escrow account, the proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby will be used
to fund a portion of the Transactions as set forth below. See “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information and Other Data” and “The Transactions.” In addition, an affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. is
administrative agent and collateral agent under the Sigura Existing Credit Agreements and certain of the initial
purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders under the Sigura Existing Credit Agreements and/or the Solenis
Existing Credit Agreements and will be entitled to receive customary fees in connection therewith and may receive a
portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to repay such indebtedness. See “Plan of Distribution” and
“Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

On July 3, 2021, CD&R Seahawk Holdings, L.P., BASF Nederland B.V., Solenis UK International
Limited, and Parent entered into that certain Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended and restated on September
4, 2021, and as further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Acquisition
Agreement”) pursuant to which the Solenis business will be acquired by Parent through the acquisition, by the
subsidiaries of Parent, of the Solenis group companies identified in the Acquisition Agreement as the companies to

unaudited pro forma condensed Solenis balance sheet as of June 30, 2021 with the explanatory notes thereto (the
“Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Solenis Balance Sheet”) and (b) the unaudited pro forma condensed Solenis
statement of operations data for the twelve months ended September 30, 2020 and the twelve months ended June 30,
2021, together with the related explanatory notes thereto (the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Solenis Statement
of Operations” and, together with the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Solenis Balance Sheet, the “Unaudited Pro
Forma Condensed Solenis Financial Information”).

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Sigura Financial Information included in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented herein for the Sigura business, reported at the level of
Innovative Water Care Global Corporation and is derived from: (a) the unaudited pro forma condensed Sigura

Condensed Sigura Balance Sheet, the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Sigura Financial Information,” and, (ii)
together with the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Solenis Statement of Operations, the “Unaudited Pro Forma
Condensed Combined Statement of Operations”). The fiscal year end of Sigura, which is December 31, has not been
conformed to the fiscal year end of Solenis, which is September 30, for the purpose of presenting the unaudited pro

The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is presented to illustrate
the effects of the Acquisition and the Reorganization, including the payment of the consideration in connection
therewith, the investment by the Sponsor in the stock of an indirect parent of Parent for approximately $1,993
million of cash (the “Equity Investment”), as well as the repayment in full, or the satisfaction and discharge in full of
the obligations under any governing instruments, as applicable, of the existing indebtedness of Solenis (other than
the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement, which will remain in place following the consummation of the
Transactions) and Sigura (collectively, the “Refinancing”) (which includes the senior secured term loan facility in an
aggregate principal amount expected to be approximately $1,400 million, subject to exchange rates and sizing
between the Dollar and Euro tranches, (the “New Term Loan Facility”) and the senior secured asset-based revolving
multi-currency credit facility with committed capacity expected to be $500.0 million, subject to borrowing base
availability (the “New ABL Revolving Credit Facility” and, together with the New Term Loan Facility, the “New
Credit Facilities”) and the issuance of the notes offered hereby (the “Notes” and, together with the Refinancing, the

Facility in connection with the closing of the Transactions.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is prepared, unless otherwise
specified, on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies used in the preparation of the audited financial
statements of Solenis UK International as of September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 and for the twelve months
ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of
Operations for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred on July 1, 2020. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations for the twelve
months ended September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020 gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had
occurred on October 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020, respectively. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined
Balance Sheet gives pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they were completed on June 30, 2021.

The historical consolidated financial information of each of the Solenis business (reported at the level of
Solenis UK International) and the Sigura business (reported at the level of Innovative Water Care Global
Corporation) has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to the transaction accounting adjustments related to the
Transactions in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The assumptions underlying the pro forma adjustments are described
fully in the accompanying notes, which should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X as promulgated by the SEC under the Securities

operations that the combined group will experience after the transactions. In addition, the accompanying Unaudited
Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations does not include any expected cost savings, operating
synergies, or other transaction effects that have occurred or are reasonably expected to occur.

**NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**Note 1 — Description of the Transactions**

**Acquisition**

On July 3, 2021, the Sellers, Solenis UK International and Parent entered into the Acquisition
Agreement, pursuant to which the Solenis business will be acquired by Parent through the acquisition, by the
subsidiaries of Parent, of the Solenis group companies identified in the Acquisition Agreement as the companies
to be acquired pursuant to the Alternative Transaction Structure (as defined therein), for an aggregate purchase
price equal to $5.25 billion, subject to certain adjustments related to retained capital leases, pension and other
liabilities, tax adjustments and other fees.

We expect the purchase price for the Acquisition will be financed through:

       - borrowings under the New Credit Facilities;

97


-----

      - proceeds of the Notes offered hereby; and

      - the Equity Investment.

For a detailed discussion of the expected sources and uses of funds for the Transactions, see “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” “Description of New
Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness,” “Description of Unsecured Notes” and “Description of Secured
Notes.”

The consummation of the Acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including, among others,
(i) the receipt of certain required regulatory approvals or lapse of certain review periods with respect thereto, (ii)
the absence of a material adverse effect on the business, assets, liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition of Solenis and its subsidiaries, (iii) the accuracy of representations and warranties (subject to certain
materiality qualifiers), (iv) material compliance with covenants contained in the Acquisition Agreement and (v)
the absence of any law or order (U.S. or foreign) making illegal the consummation of the Acquisition. We
currently expect to receive final approvals and for the consummation of the Acquisition to occur in the third
calendar quarter of 2021. However, there can be no guarantee that we will receive the requisite approvals within
this time frame or at all. Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is expected to close
two (2) business days after all of the requisite closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, unless otherwise
agreed.

The Acquisition Agreement contains certain termination rights of the Sellers and Parent, including the
right to terminate if the Acquisition has not been consummated by the Acquisition Outside Date. The
Acquisition Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. The representations
and warranties do not survive the consummation of the Acquisition, and we therefore will have no post-closing
contractual indemnification from the Sellers for any breaches of representations or warranties. Parent intends to
purchase representation and warranty insurance to mitigate some of this risk.

Concurrently with the Acquisition, pursuant to a transaction agreement, dated as of July 3, 2021 (the
“Transaction Agreement”), Platinum and certain of its affiliates will, following the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, contribute to Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership, all of the shares of common stock of IWC Holding Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, which represent all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of IWC Holding Corporation, in
exchange for newly issued units in Olympus Water Holding I, L.P., having a value equal to the contributed
shares of IWC Holding Corporation, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately be
contributed to each of Olympus Water Holding II, L.P., and to Olympus Water Holding III, L.P., and to
Olympus Water Holding IV, L.P. and to the Issuer, with the result that IWC Holding Corporation will be held as
a subsidiary of the Issuer. The Reorganization implies a rollover of existing equity interests of the Sponsor and
certain of its affiliates in Sigura of $500 million. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**The Offering, Escrow and Escrow Release**

This offering may close concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition. If this offering closes
prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement. At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be
secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments
therein. The Escrow Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Assuming the Escrow Release
Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Guarantors will become parties to the
Indentures pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures, and the obligations will become obligations of the
Guarantors.

The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or
event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indentures. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow

98


-----

Release Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or
event of default under the Indentures has or would have occurred and is continuing.”

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be
incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Acquisition Outside
Date, the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the
Acquisition, each series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of
the initial issue price of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but
excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon
the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a
result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the applicable series of Notes.” The escrowed funds will be
limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes, together with any earnings thereon and investments
thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that may be
payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. An affiliate of Platinum will issue the Equity
Commitment Letter to the Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Notes,
to transfer to the Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in
the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and expenses.

If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes
will not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum.

For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see
“Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption” and “Description of
Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

**The Refinancing**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and the Reorganization and, if applicable, the
satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions, we will consummate the Refinancing using the proceeds from the
Notes, the Equity Investment and the New Credit Facilities.

**The New Credit Facilities**

Concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition and, if applicable, the satisfaction of the Escrow
Release Conditions, the Issuer and the Guarantors will enter into the New Term Loan Credit Agreement
providing for the New Term Loan Facility and will enter into the New ABL Credit Agreement providing for the
New ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

**Equity Investment**

As part of the Acquisition, the Sponsor will fund the Equity Investment of approximately $1,993
million in cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which we expect will, through a series of transactions, ultimately
be contributed to each of the Issuer and Olympus Water UK Holdings Ltd as common equity, and which will be
used as part of the consideration to be paid in connection with the Acquisition.

**Note 2 — Basis of Presentation**

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information was prepared using the
acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805,
Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), and using the fair value concepts defined in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value
Measurement (“ASC 820”) and based on the historical consolidated financial statements of Solenis and Sigura.
Under ASC 805, all Solenis assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized and
measured at their assumed acquisition date fair value, while transaction costs and restructuring costs associated

99


-----

with the business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of merger consideration over the fair value
of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill.

The Transaction did not meet the definition under ASC 805 as a Business Combination for the Sigura
business but rather Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control (ASC 805-50). Under ASC 805-50
all Sigura assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized and measured at their historical carrying
amounts.

The allocation of the purchase consideration for the Acquisition depends upon certain estimates and
assumptions, all of which are preliminary. The allocation of the purchase consideration has been made for the
purpose of developing the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. A final
determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed relating to the Acquisition could differ
materially from the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration. This final valuation will be based on
the actual net tangible and intangible assets of Solenis and Sigura existing at the acquisition date. Pursuant to the
terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is expected to close the month in which all the requisite
closing conditions have been satisfied. The final valuation may materially change the allocation of the purchase
consideration, which could materially affect the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result
in a material change to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information.

The transaction accounting adjustments represent management’s best estimates and are based upon
currently available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the
circumstances.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information presented is for illustrative
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have
been realized if the Acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future
operating results or financial position.

We have undertaken a preliminary review of both Solenis’ and Sigura’s accounting policies and did not
identify any significant adjustments that would be required to be made in order to conform the accounting
policies of the companies. Solenis has not adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard as part of
the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. We do not expect that the adoption of
the new revenue recognition accounting standard would have a material impact.

As part of the Transactions, we will terminate the MUFG Receivables Purchasing Agreement
(adjustment to Accounts receivable of $161.4 million and Sold receivables of $114.8 million).

(b) Financing and Equity Adjustments - In connection with the Transactions, we will repay in full all
Existing Indebtedness. See “Use of Proceeds.” In addition, we wrote off $25.1 million of deferred
costs associated with the Sigura Existing Indebtedness. The New Term Loan Facility and the

(1) These amounts do not reflect that it is expected that the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement
will remain outstanding following the consummation of the Transactions, and that one or more of
the tranches of indebtedness constituting the Financing may be reduced accordingly by
approximately $90 million in the aggregate.

The adjustments for financing reflect assumed repayment of $2.0 million of accrued interest to be
repaid upon closing of the transactions.

Equity adjustments represent the proposed recapitalization of the combined business.

(c) Intercompany – Represents amounts due to/due from Solenis and Sigura that are eliminated in
consolidation and eliminating for balances at Solenis UK International and Solenis UK Industries,
which holding companies are not being acquired in the Acquisition.

million in cash to an indirect parent of Parent, which we expect will, through a series of
transactions, ultimately be contributed to each of the Issuer and to Olympus Water UK Holdings
Ltd as common equity. The Reorganization implies a rollover of existing equity interests of the
Sponsor and certain of its affiliates in Sigura of $500 million.

**Overview**

Solenis is a leading manufacturer and distributor of specialty chemicals and solutions for consumer and
industrial water intensive industries, including the pulp, packaging paper and board, tissue and towel, oil and gas,
petroleum refining, chemical processing, mining, biorefining, power and municipal markets. Our product portfolio
includes a broad array of water treatment chemistries, process aids, functional additives as well as state-of-the-art
monitoring and control systems. These technologies are used by customers to improve operational efficiencies,
enhance product quality, protect plant assets and minimize environmental impact.

Founded in 1907 and headquartered in Wilmington, Delaware, in July 2014, Solenis (formerly named
Ashland Water Technologies (“AWT”)) was acquired by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”) from Ashland
Inc. (“Ashland”). In January 2019, as part of a joint venture arrangement (the “JV”), Solenis merged with the paper
and water chemicals business of BASF SE (“BASF”), a Germany-based chemical manufacturer and distributor,
creating a solutions provider for the pulp and paper and water treatment industries, owned 49.5% by CD&R, 49% by
BASF and 1.5% by members of the joint venture management team.

**Factors Affecting Our Operating Results**

The following discussion sets forth certain components of our statements of operation as well as factors
that impact those items:

**_Net sales_**

We generate revenue from the sale of products and services within each of the four geographic markets that
we serve. Our Net sales represents gross revenue net of estimates for returns and price allowances. Price allowances

107


-----

are inclusive of discounts for prompt payment, customer specific rebates, continuous improvement rebates, and
other volume based incentives. Our overall Net sales are impacted by the following factors:

      - Fluctuations in overall economic activity within the geographic markets that we serve;

      - Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates;

      - Changes in the prices charged for products and services;

      - Changes in the overall volume of customers served based on underlying fluctuations in supply and
demand;

      - Changes in the level of competition in the marketplace, either via price, or the launch of new products
by competitors;

      - Changes in the application or applied usage of our products and services; and

      - Sales and amortization of reverse supply agreements acquired as part of the acquisition of BASF.

**_Cost of sales_**

Our Cost of sales consists primarily of the following:

      - _Materials and production costs: We purchase raw materials from a global network of suppliers to_
support the production of finished products and the delivery of services;

      - _Employee Costs: To retain the talent necessary to deliver high-quality products and services, we incur_
significant employee compensation and benefits costs. Payroll costs recognized via Cost of sales relate
specifically to those employees involved in the manufacturing process;

      - _Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and_
depreciated based on their estimated useful lives. Acquired property, plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets are recognized at their acquired fair values and amortized over their respective
useful lives. Assets specifically related to the production of goods and services such as an allocated
portion of costs incurred for our plant and buildings, and machine and equipment as well as
amortization expense relative to patents, process know-how and supply agreements are recognized via
Cost of sales; and

      - _Other: Remaining Cost of sales relates to freight costs, warehousing expenses, costs associated with the_
idling of production facilities, product claims, or other general manufacturing costs.

Our overall Cost of sales is impacted by the following factors:

      - Changes in the price of raw materials, i.e. deflationary or inflationary price changes in the costs of
commodities;

      - Production volumes and utilization;

      - Improvement in production efficiency or other post-acquisition process improvements or cost savings
initiatives; and

      - Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

**_Selling, general and administrative expense_**

Our Selling, general and administrative expense of all expenditures incurred in connection with the sales
and marketing of our products and services, in addition to general and administrative costs, including:

      - Compensation and benefits costs for management, including stock-based compensation expenses;

108


-----

      - Expenses relating to sales personnel primarily resulting from increases or decreases in sales volume or
to meet changes in anticipated demand;

      - Expenses related to support functions and executives;

      - Depreciation expense excluding that recognized via Cost of sales in addition to other general selling
expenses incurred in the normal course of business; and

      - Service cost on our pension and other post-employment benefit plans.

Changes in our Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales are primarily
driven by:

      - Variances in sales volume, as fixed costs can be spread to higher sales totals;

      - Changes in demand which can impact our determinations of budgeted costs necessary to both maintain
our customer base and increase our gross revenue on a constant currency basis;

      - Frequency and depth of product launches or entrances and exits into market or geographical segments;
and

      - Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

**_Research and development expense_**

Our Research and development expense represents costs incurred to develop new products or services or
those incurred to develop and improve upon existing products or processes.

**_Amortization of intangibles_**

Amortization of intangibles represents the ratable recognition of expense relative to acquired definite-life
intangible assets that were initially recorded at fair value. This expense is exclusive of amortization recognized
through Cost of sales. Expense incurred and recognized via Amortization of intangibles primarily relates to assets
that are not directly related to revenue generating activities, i.e. customer relationships, trademarks and tradenames,
and land use rights.

**_Restructuring and severance expense_**

Our Restructuring and severance expense relates to costs incurred for implemented reductions in force and
strategic restructuring decisions designed to reduce overall spend and better align the personnel and leadership with
our organizational structure.

**_Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets_**

We perform impairment assessments at least annually relative to any acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets, including in-process research and development assets. Additionally, we assesses definite-lived
intangible assets for impairment to determine whether a qualitative or quantitative triggering event has occurred.

**_Acquisition and transaction related expenses_**

We continually seek opportunities to improve upon our market position and gain synergies via business
combinations. Acquisition and transaction related expenses represents costs incurred from completed, in-process, or
abandoned mergers and acquisition opportunities primarily for due diligence and valuation efforts.

**_Other operating (income) expense, net_**

We recognize Other operating (income) expense, net as a result of income and expense realized in the
ordinary course of our operations but are not classified as expense types identified above. Examples include realized

109


-----

foreign exchange gains on operational transactions and gains and losses on sales of property, plant, and equipment,
as well as bank fees and other financial costs.

**_Non-operating expense (income), net_**

We recognize Non-operating expense (income), net as a result of income and expense which arise from
transactions or other items which give rise to income or expense which are not in the ordinary course of our
operations. Such items include the following:

      - Unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses;

      - Our share of income from our joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting net of
distributions;

      - Royalty income;

      - Pension expense (excluding Service cost, which is included in Selling, general and administrative
expense); and

      - Adjustments in the value of tax indemnification assets.

Other items which influence Non-operating expense (income), net include certain non-recurring items
which are not related to our operations such as:

      - Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts; and

      - Losses on extinguishment of debt.

**_Interest expense_**

Interest expense primarily relates to costs incurred for interest expense on our external borrowings and
other long-term liabilities. Other elements included in interest expense include:

      - Amortization of deferred financing costs incurred in connection with our debt borrowings and Revolving
Credit Facility;

      - Accretion of original issue discount on our debt borrowings;

      - Interest expense on our note payable to our shareholders; and

      - Reclassifications from Other comprehensive income related to our interest rate swaps.

**_Income tax provision_**

We are subject to income tax in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Though the extent of our
future tax liabilities is uncertain, changes to our corporate structure, capitalization and future acquisitions are all
factors which may impact future book and taxable income of our subsidiaries and Solenis as a whole. Our effective
tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide
range of tax rates, permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and local tax laws, and certain one-time items
including tax rate changes, benefit of non-U.S. taxes, and adjustments related to unremitted earnings of our
subsidiaries. The amortization and increased interest expense related to our acquisitions and capital structure reduces
our profit before tax to a level where the effective tax rate is highly sensitive.

Operations and are intended to supplement the information provided in the accompanying financial statements and
related notes included previously in these financial statements.

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by $104.5 million, or 15.7%, to $772.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021 as compared to Net sales of $667.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Net sales
was primarily driven by increases in sales volume, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
increases in pricing, and the incremental impact in the current year of our acquisitions which increased Net sales by
$42 million, $41 million, $14 million, and $8 million, respectively.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by $90.6 million, or 19.7%, to $551.7 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021, as compared to Cost of sales of $461.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Cost
of sales was primarily attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, incremental sales volume, the
impact of raw material inflation, and the incremental impact in the current year of our acquisitions which increased
Cost of sales by $31 million, $29 million, $27 million, and $5 million, respectively.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $7.9 million, or 6.2%, to $134.0 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $126.1 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2020. The overall increase in Selling, general and administrative expense was
driven by the wind-down of various temporary cost reduction programs actioned in 2020 which increased Selling,
general and administrative expense by $12 million, as well as the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates which increased Selling, general and administrative expense by $7 million. These increases were primarily
offset by the incremental cost savings realized as a result of permanent cost reduction programs actioned during
2020 which resulted in reductions to Selling, general and administrative expense of $10 million.

-----

Despite the increase in operating expenses, Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of
Net sales decreased from 18.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to 17.3% for the three months ended June
30, 2021 driven primarily by increases in Net sales.

_Research and development expense_

Research and development expense increased by $1.7 million, or 18.9%, to $10.7 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $9.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. Research and
development expense as a percentage of Net sales was consistent between periods, equal to 1.4% for the three
months ended June 30, 2021, and 1.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $0.8 million, or 6.8%, to $12.5 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $11.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in the
Amortization of intangible assets was primarily driven by the current year impact of our prior year acquisitions for
which we recognized amortizable Customer Relationship assets at each respective acquisition date.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses decreased by $3.7 million, to $0.7 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2021, as compared to $4.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily
driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives related to planned reductions in force in connection with the
synergy objectives for the JV or in response to COVID-19.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $2.5 million, or 1,061.2%, to expense of $2.7
million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of
$0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the timing and relative
size of our various acquisitions and contemplated transactions.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating expense, net increased from $1.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020 to $5.6
million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. Fluctuations in Other operating expense, net were primarily
related to Realized foreign exchange losses related to our operations and the settlement of various intercompany
transactions.

The following table summarizes the components of Other operating expense, net for the three months
ended June 30, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands):

_Non-operating expense, net_

Non-operating expense, net, increased from expense of $10.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2020, to expense of $11.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by
the loss recognized as a result of the deconsolidation of our former subsidiary in Trinidad and Tobago, offset by the
result of year-over-year changes in unrealized (gains) losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates associated with our Euro-denominated debt as well as the reversal of the unrealized losses associated
with certain intercompany transactions that were settled during the three months ended June 30, 2021.

The following table summarizes the components of Non-operating expense, net for the three months ended
June 30, 2021, and 2020 (in thousands):

**For the Three Months Ended June 30,**
**2021** **2020** **Variance**
Loss on deconsolidation of subsidiary .......................................  $ 17,959 $ — $ 17,959

Other, net ............................................................................... (594) (924) 330
Total ......................................................................................  $ 11,558 $ 10,388 $ 1,170

_Interest expense_

Interest expense decreased by $5.4 million, or 11.8%, to $40.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021, as compared to $45.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in our interest expense
was driven by a variety of factors including overall reductions in average total borrowings (reduction of $2.5
million), the impact of our EUR debt repricing (reduction of $1.7 million), and reductions in market interest rates
(reduction of $1.0 million).

_Income tax provision_

Income tax provision increased by $13.1 million, or 326.3%, to $17.1 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2021, as compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The Company’s income tax
benefit and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of income or
losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax laws, and
certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted earnings
of subsidiaries.

Net income (loss) ............................................  $ 30,836 $ (55,843) $ 86,679 (155.2)%

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by $106.1 million, or 5.1%, to $2,183.2 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2021 as compared to Net sales of $2,077.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Net
sales was primarily driven by the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, increases in pricing, and
the incremental impact of our acquisitions, which increased Net sales by $70 million, $20 million, and $15 million,
respectively.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by $51.8 million, or 3.5%, to $1,521.6 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2021, as compared to Cost of sales of $1,469.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in
Cost of sales was primarily attributable to the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the flow
through impact of raw material inflation, and the impact of incremental incentives charges, which increased our Cost
of sales by $53 million, $7 million, and $6 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the changes
in sales mix which reduced our Cost of sales by $12 million.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $14.1 million, or 3.5%, to $390.5 million for the
nine months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $404.6 million for
the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The overall decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense was
driven by various permanent cost reduction initiatives (reduction of $33 million) resulting from management actions
in response to COVID-19. These reductions in cost were primarily offset by the effect of fluctuation in foreign
currency exchange rates (increase of $11 million) as well as incremental incentive compensation accruals (increase
of $9 million) driven primarily by the Company’s strong earnings performance relative to our initial business plan as
well as the timing of our above-target accruals.

114


-----

Consistent with the reduction in operating expenses, Selling, general, and administrative expense as a
percentage of Net sales decreased from 19.5% for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 to 17.9% for the nine
months ended June 30, 2021.

_Research and development expense_

Research and development expense increased $1.7 million, or 5.6%, to $32.0 million for the nine months
ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $30.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. Research and
development expense as a percentage of Net sales was consistent between periods, equal to 1.5% for the nine
months ended June 30, 2021, and 1.5% for the nine months ended June 30, 2020.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $1.9 million, or 5.2%, to $37.5 million for the nine months
ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $35.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in the
Amortization of intangible assets was primarily driven by the current year impact of our prior year acquisitions for
which we recognized amortizable Customer Relationship assets at each respective acquisition date.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or 20.6%, to $4.9 million for the nine
months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to $6.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease
was primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives related to planned reductions in force in connection
with the synergy objectives for the JV or in response to COVID-19.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 94%, to expense of $3.2 million
for the nine months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $1.6
million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the timing and relative size
of our various acquisitions and contemplated actions.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating expense, net increased from $8.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 to $15.1
million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021. Fluctuations in Other operating expense, net were primarily related
to Realized foreign exchange losses related to our operations and the settlement of various intercompany
transactions.

2021, as compared to $137.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in our interest expense
was driven by a variety of factors including reductions in market interest rates (reduction of $5.3 million), the
impact of our EUR debt repricing (reduction of $2.3 million), overall reductions in average total borrowings
(reduction of $2.3 million), in addition to the effect of reduced interest on our accounts receivable financing facility
and financing leases which reduced our interest expense by approximately $2 million in the aggregate.

_Income tax provision_

Net (loss) ......................................................... $ (141,480) $ (176,753) $ 35,273 (20.0)%

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by $243.7 million, or 9.7%, to $2,753.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020
as compared to Net sales of $2,509.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by incremental Net sales of heritage BASF Paper & Water materials of $247 million resulting from
the incremental four months of consolidated BASF P&W results in 2020 relative to the eight month post-acquisition
period of 2019. Additionally, the increase in Net sales was partially attributable to increases in pricing primarily
related to the recapture of historical changes in raw material costs of $30 million, offset by the effect of fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates which reduced Net sales by $61 million. The remainder of the variance in Net
sales was primarily attributable to changes in volume.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by $123.8 million, or 6.8%, to $1,939.4 million for the year ended September 30,
2020, as compared to Cost of sales of $1,815.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase was
primarily driven by incremental sales of heritage BASF Paper & Water materials which increased Cost of sales by
$193 million which was offset by the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which reduced Cost
of sales by $43 million as well as the impact of raw material deflation which reduced our Cost of sales by $38
million. The remainder of the variance was primarily driven by changes in volume and mix, the impact of
compensation incentive increases, and the realization of certain procurement and production cost synergies that were
identified prior the acquisition of the BASF Paper & Water business on January 31, 2019.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $1.7 million, or 0.3%, to $537.0 million for the
year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $535.3 million for
the year ended September 30, 2019. The overall increase in Selling, general and administrative expense was driven
by a combination of factors specific to the incremental impact of the full year consolidation of the BASF Paper &
Water business (increase of $52 million), the realization of cost synergies identified as part of the pre-acquisition

117


-----

due diligence process specific to BASF Paper & Water (decrease of $20 million), as well as the impact of our strong
fiscal year 2020 performance on incentive compensation accruals (increase of $49 million), offset by the impact of
certain long-term and short-term cost reductions taken in response to COVID-19 to preserve profitability (decrease
of $34 million). These net increases were primarily offset by a reduction in non-recurring costs primarily related to
the 2019 consummation of the JV (reduction of $21 million) as well as the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates (reduction of $15 million).

Despite the increase in our overall costs, Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of
Net sales decreased from 21.3% for the year ended September 30, 2019 to 19.5% for the year ended September 30,
2020. This relative decrease was driven by the acquisition of the BASF Paper & Water business for which the costs
to serve our acquired customers is generally lower (on both a pre-synergy, and post-synergy basis) than that of the
heritage Solenis business.

_Research and development expense_

Research and development expense decreased by $1.3 million, or (3.0)%, to $40.8 million for the year
ended year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $42.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2019.
Research and development expense as a percentage of Net sales decreased between periods, from 1.7% for the year
ended September 30, 2019, to 1.5% for the year ended September 30, 2020.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased by $5.0 million, or 11.5%, to $47.9 million for the year ended
September 30, 2020, as compared to $43.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in the
Amortization of intangible assets was primarily driven by the consolidation of the full year results of the acquired
BASF Paper & Water business in 2020 versus the reflection of just the eight month post-acquisition period in 2019.

_Impairment of goodwill_

The impairment of goodwill recognized for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $19.2 million. There
was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended September 30, 2019. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the
impairment charge related to our Asia Pacific Pulp & Paper reporting unit, for which we determined that the
carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses decreased by $9.3 million, or 30.6%, to $21.2 million for the year
ended September 30, 2020, as compared to $30.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The decrease was
primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives primarily related to planned reductions in force in
connection with the synergy objectives for the JV.

_Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses decreased by $57.4 million, or 96.3%, to $2.2 million for the
year ended September 30, 2020, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $59.7 million for
the year ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the timing and relative size of our
various acquisitions. Though we acquired both Chemsystem’s Pulp & Paper business and Poliquimicos during the
year ended September 30, 2020 (aggregate cash paid of $27 million), our Acquisition and transaction-related
expenses of $59.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 were driven by the acquisition of BASF Paper &
Water (total cash and equity consideration conveyed of $882 million) which closed on January 31, 2019.

_Other operating expense, net_

Other operating expense, net decreased from $18.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2019 to $10.4
million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Fluctuations in Other operating expense, net were primarily related

Non-operating expense (income), net decreased from income of $49.6 million for the year ended
September 30, 2019, to expense of $87.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was
primarily the result of year-over-year changes in unrealized losses (gains) as a result of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates associated with our Euro-denominated debt.

The following table summarizes the components of Non-operating expense (income), net for the years
ended September 30, 2020, and 2019 (in thousands):

**For the Years Ended September 30,**
**2020** **2019** **Variance**
Unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains), net ............................  $ 87,919 $ (45,928) $ 133,847
Net periodic benefit costs, exclusive of service cost ...................... 2,203 1,372 831
Effect of adjustments to indemnified uncertain tax positions .......... 1,303 — 1,303
Equity income ........................................................................... (349) (219) (130)

Adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities ........................ — (5,654) 5,654
Loss on extinguishment of debt ................................................... — 596 (596)
Total non-operating expense (income), net ...................................  $ 87,091 $ (49,593) $ 136,684

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased by $12.9 million, or 7.6%, to $182.9 million for the year ended September 30,
2020, as compared to $170.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in our interest expense
was primarily driven by the incremental First Lien debt obtained in connection with the financing of our acquisition
of BASF Paper & Water on January 31, 2019 for which we obtained approximately $525 million in aggregate
proceeds from our USD and EUR tranches, in addition to $124 million of revolver borrowings available under the
First Lien USD borrowings. These borrowings were primarily outstanding for all of 2020 relative to just the eight
month post-acquisition period of 2019.

_Income tax provision_

Income tax provision decreased by $14.6 million, or 68.4%, to $6.8 million for the year ended September
30, 2020, as compared to $21.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. While we continue to generate
significant pre-tax losses in foreign jurisdictions, those losses are less than those generated in the prior year. The
United States generated a large pre-tax loss, mainly driven by intercompany transactions and interest expense related
to the third-party debt obligations of Solenis UK International. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year-to-year
due to changes in the mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences
between GAAP and local tax laws, and certain one-time items including tax rate changes, benefit of non-US taxes,
and adjustments related to the unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate for the year ended
September 30, 2020 increased as a result of the aforementioned pre-tax loss position and the corresponding tax
benefit recorded. In comparison to the year ended September 30, 2019, the increase to the income tax provision was

119


-----

largely attributable to the foreign tax rate differential between the United States and our foreign jurisdictions, the
reduction in valuation allowances in jurisdictions for which deferred tax benefits are not expected to be fully
realizable, and the decreased recognition of uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions.

_Net sales_

Net sales increased by $610.4 million, or 32.1%, to $2,509.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019
as compared to Net sales of $1,899.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in Net Sales was
primarily driven by the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water which increased Net Sales by $614 million.
Additionally, price increases largely driven by the recapture of raw material cost inflation increased Net Sales by
$49 million, while the full year results of our prior year acquisitions of Topchim and CBC yielded incremental sales
of $11 million. These increases were offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which
reduced our Net sales by $71 million. The remaining variance was primarily driven by a combination of changes in
volume and sales mix.

_Cost of sales_

Cost of sales increased by $547.7 million, or 43.2%, to $1,815.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2019, as compared to Cost of sales of $1,267.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in Cost
of sales was primarily driven by the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water which increased Cost of sales by $520
million. Additionally, raw material inflation, non-cash purchase accounting and other inventory adjustments, and the
full year impact of our prior year acquisitions increased Cost of sales by $41 million, $19 million, and $8 million,
respectively. Additionally, inventory provisions increased our Cost of sales by $6 million. These increases were
offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which reduced our Cost of sales by $49
million. The remaining variance was primarily driven by a combination of changes in volume and sales mix.

_Selling, general and administrative expense_

Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $77.8 million, or 17.0%, to $535.3 million for the
year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $457.5 million for
the year ended September 30, 2018. The overall increase in Selling, general and administrative expense was
primarily driven by the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water which resulted in net increases of approximately $64
million inclusive of realized cost synergies. In addition, we incurred $35 million of internal costs related to the JV
related to deal specific compensation, travel and training costs necessary to help ensure the close of the transaction
and realized the related cost synergies. These increases were offset by decreases driven by the restructuring of our
IWT business and the favorable impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, each of which reduced
our Selling, general and administrative expense by $12 million.

Despite the increase in our overall costs, Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of
Net sales decreased between periods from 24.1% to 21.3% for the years ended September 30, 2018 and 2019,
respectively. This relative decrease was driven by the acquisition of the BASF Paper & Water for which the costs to
serve our acquired customers is generally lower (on both a pre-synergy, and post-synergy basis) than that of the
heritage Solenis business.

_Research and development expense_

Research and development expense increased $1.3 million, or 3.2%, to $42.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2019, as compared to $40.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. Research and
development expense as a percentage of Net sales decreased between periods, from 2.1% for the year ended
September 30, 2018, to 1.7% for the year ended September 30, 2019.

_Amortization of intangible assets_

Amortization of intangible assets increased $10.5 million, or 32.2%, to $43.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2019, as compared to $32.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in
Amortization of intangible assets was driven primarily by our incremental amortization from new customer
relationships assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water.

_Impairment of goodwill_

There was no impairment of goodwill for the year ended September 30, 2019. Impairment of goodwill was
$27.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. For the year ended September 30, 2018, the impairment
charge related to our Asia Pacific Pulp & Paper and Latin America IWT reporting units, for which we determined
that the carrying values exceeded the determined fair values for each reporting unit. As of September 30, 2018 (prior
to the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water), the remaining goodwill ascribed to each of these reporting units was $0.

_Impairment of intangible assets_

There was no impairment of intangible assets for the year ended September 30, 2019. Impairment of
intangible assets was $2.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The entirety of the impairment during the
year ended September 30, 2018 related to the abandonment of our remaining research and development projects
which were originally acquired in connection with our acquisition of the AWT business from Ashland. As of both
September 30, 2019 and 2018, we have total remaining in-process research and development assets of $0.

_Restructuring and severance expenses_

Restructuring and severance expenses increased by $24.7 million, or 425.2%, to $30.5 million for the year
ended September 30, 2019, as compared to $5.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase was
primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives primarily related to planned reductions in force in
connection with the synergy objectives for the JV.

121


-----

_Acquisition and transaction related expenses_

Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased $32.4 million, or 118.8%, to $59.7 million for the
year ended September 30, 2019, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $27.3 million for
the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives
primarily related to planned reductions in force in connection with the synergy objectives for the JV.

_Other operating (income) expense, net_

Other operating (income) expense, net changed from income of $3.7 million for the year ended September
30, 2018 to expense of $18.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. Fluctuations in Other operating
expense (income), net were primarily related to realized foreign exchange losses related to our operations.

The following table summarizes the components of Other operating expense (income), net for the years
ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands).

**For the Years Ended September**
**30,**

Total other (income) expense, net .................................................. $ 18,512 $ (3,694) $ 22,206

_Non-operating expense (income), net_

Non-operating expense (income), net increased from expense of $22.0 million for the year ended
September 30, 2018, to income of $49.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily
the result of year-over-year changes in unrealized gains (losses) as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates associated with our Euro-denominated debt.

The following table summarizes the components of Non-operating expense (income), net of the years
ended September 30, 2019, and 2018 (in thousands):

**For the years ended September 30,**
**2019** **2018** **Variance**
Unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses, net ............................  $ (45,928) $ 29,466 $ (75,394)

Total ........................................................................................  $ (49,593) $ 22,048 $ (71,641)

_Interest expense_

Interest expense increased by $41.1 million, or 31.9%, to $170.0 million for the year ended September 30,
2019, as compared to $128.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. This increase in our interest expense

122


-----

was primarily driven by the incremental First Lien debt obtained in connection with the financing of our acquisition
of BASF Paper & Water for which we obtained approximately $525 million in aggregate proceeds from our USD
and EUR tranches, in addition to $124 million of revolver borrowings available under the First Lien USD
borrowings. As of September 30, 2019 and 2018, Solenis UK International had total debt of $2.4 billion, and $1.6
billion, respectively. The incremental borrowings were outstanding for the majority of the year ended September 30,
2019 as the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water closed on January 31, 2019.

_Income tax provision_

Income tax provision increased $12.8 million, or 148.7%, to $21.4 million for the year ended September
30, 2019, as compared to $8.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. While we continue to generate
significant pre-tax losses in foreign jurisdictions, those losses are less than those generated in the prior year. The
United States generated a large pre-tax loss, mainly driven by intercompany transactions and the shifting of the debt
and related interest expense to the U.S. operating entity. Our effective tax rate fluctuates from year-to-year due to
changes in the mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences
between GAAP and local tax laws, and certain one-time items including tax rate changes, benefit of non-US taxes,
and adjustments related to the unremitted earnings of our subsidiaries. The amortization and increased interest
expense related to our acquisitions reduces our profit before tax to a level where the effective tax rate is highly
sensitive. Our effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2019 decreased as a result of the aforementioned
pre-tax loss position and the corresponding increase in our income tax expense. In comparison to the year ended
September 30, 2018, the increase in income tax expense was largely attributable to the foreign tax rate differential
between the United States and our foreign jurisdictions, the valuation allowances in jurisdictions for which deferred
tax benefits are not expected to be fully realizable, and the recognition of uncertain tax positions in various
jurisdictions. Other factors contributing to the fluctuation in the effective tax rate are the impact of the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act’s new Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (“BEAT”), which was effective beginning fiscal year 2019, along
with transaction costs related to the BASF acquisition that must be permanently disallowed in certain jurisdictions
where goodwill is non-deductible.

Segment profit ...................... 73,390 68,358 5,032 7.4%
Segment profit margin % ...... 16.1% 17.3% (120) bps (6.9)%

Net sales increased by $60.4 million, or 15.3%, to $455.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021
compared to Net sales of $395.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, incremental sales volume, increases
in pricing, and the incremental impact of our acquisitions which increased Net sales by $26 million, $25 million, $9
million, and $8 million, respectively.

Gross profit increased by $12.2 million, or 9.8%, to $137.3 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021 compared to Gross profit of $125.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Gross profit was
primarily driven by the effect of incremental sales volume, increases in price, the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates, and the incremental impact of our acquisitions, which contributed incremental Gross profit
of $10 million, $9 million, $7 million, and $2 million, respectively. These increases were primarily offset by the
impact of net raw material inflation, which reduced our Gross profit by $14 million.

Segment profit increased by $5.0 million, or 7.4%, to $73.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021, compared to segment profit of $68.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in
Segment profit was primarily driven by the flow-through impact of Gross profit (increase of $15 million), offset by
incremental operating expenses of $4 million resulting from the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates
(reduction of Segment profit), and $2 million via the net impact of permanent and temporary cost reduction actions
taken by management in response to COVID-19 (reduction of Segment profit). For a description of Segment profit,

Net sales increased by $44.1 million, or 16.2%, to $316.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021
compared to Net sales of $272.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by incremental sales volume, the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and
increases in pricing, which increased Net sales by $13 million, $12 million, and $5 million, respectively.

Gross profit increased by $1.6 million or 2.0%, to $83.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021
compared to gross profit of $81.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Gross profit was
primarily driven by the impact of raw material inflation ($13 million) which more than offset the favorable impact
of increases in price ($5 million), incremental sales volume ($4 million), and the impact of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates ($3 million).

Segment profit decreased by $4.2 million, or 9.0%, to $42.6 million for the three months ended June 30,
2021 compared to Segment profit of $46.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The decrease in
Segment profit was primarily driven by the flow through impact of Gross profit (decrease of $0.4 million), in

The following is a summary of our financial results for our Consumer Solutions segment for the nine
months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the financial results for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 (in
thousands):

**Nine months ended June 30,** **Variance**

Segment profit margin % ...... 18.0% 14.9% 310 bps 20.8%

Net sales increased by $97.8 million, or 8.0%, to $1,324.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021
compared to Net sales of $1,226.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, incremental sales volume, the
incremental impact of our acquisitions and increases in pricing, which increased Net sales by $45 million, $31
million, $15 million, and $15 million, respectively.

Gross profit increased by $52.8 million, or 14.4%, to $418.4 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2021 compared to Gross profit of $365.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Gross
profit was primarily driven by increase in pricing, the impact of changes in sales mix, the effect of fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, and increases in sales volume, which increased Gross profit by $15 million, $13
million, $12 million, and $11 million, respectively. Reductions in Gross profit driven by raw material inflation ($5
million), and incremental incentive charges ($4 million), were primarily offset by incremental Gross profit resulting
from our acquisitions of $7 million.

Segment profit increased by $55.6 million, or 30.4%, to $238.7 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2021, compared to segment profit of $183.1 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in
Segment profit was primarily driven by the flow-through impact of Gross profit (increase of $50 million), in
addition to net reductions in operating expenses via permanent and temporary actions taken by management in
response to COVID-19 ($21 million), offset by incremental costs resulting from incentive compensation adjustments
as well as the effect of fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating expenses, each of which
reduced Segment profit by $7 million.

_Industrial Solutions_

The following is a summary of our financial results for our Industrial Solutions segment for the nine
months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the financial results for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 (in
thousands):

**For the nine months ended June 30,** **Variance**
**2021** **2020** **$** **%**
Net sales ................................ $ 858,485 $ 850,270 $ 8,215 1.0%
Gross profit ........................... 243,211 241,747 1,464 0.6%
Gross profit margin % ........... 28.3% 28.4% (10) bps (0.4)%
Segment profit ...................... 124,269 119,012 5,257 4.4%
Segment profit margin % ...... 14.5% 14.0% 50 bps 3.6%

Net sales increased by $8.2 million, or 1.0%, to $858.5 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021
compared to Net sales of $850.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and increases in price, which contributed
increases to Net sales of $18 million, and $5 million, respectively. These increases were offset by reductions in sales
volume which reduced Net sales by $12 million.

Gross profit increased by $1.5 million or 0.6%, to $243.2 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021
compared to Gross profit of $241.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in Gross profit
was primarily driven by increases in pricing and the incremental impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates which each increased Gross profit by $5 million. These increases were offset by the reductions in sales volume,
inflationary raw material costs and negative sales mix, which reduced Gross profit by $5 million, $4 million, and $1
million, respectively.

Segment profit increased by $5.3 million, or 4.4%, to $124.3 million for the nine months ended June 30,
2021 compared to Segment profit of $119.0 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The increase in
Segment profit was primarily driven by the flow-through impact of Gross profit (increase of $0.2 million), offset by
a marginal increase in net operating expenses of less than $1 million. Overall, net reductions in operating expenses
resulting from permanent and temporary cost reduction actions taken by management in response to COVID-19
(reduction of $11 million) were offset by the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well the
impact of incremental incentive costs and other inflationary cost-of-living adjustments.

Segment profit margin (%) ........................... 15.7% 14.1% 160 bps 11.3%

Net sales increased by $130.0 million, or 7.9%, to $1,764.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020
compared to Net sales of $1,634.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by incremental Net sales of heritage BASF materials of $120 million resulting from the incremental
four months of consolidated BASF P&W results in 2020 relative to the eight month post-acquisition period of 2019.
Additionally, the increase in Net sales was partially attributable to increases in pricing primarily related to the
recapture of historical changes in raw material costs of $15 million, offset by the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates which reduced Net sales by $40 million. The remainder of the variance in Net sales was
primarily attributable to changes in volume.

Gross profit increased by $70.1 million, or 14.8%, to $544.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020
compared to Gross profit of $474.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in Gross profit was
primarily driven by incremental sales of heritage BASF P&W materials (increase of $34 million), the effect of
increases in pricing which were primarily related to the recapture of historical changes in raw material costs
(increase of $15 million), the impact of raw material deflation (increase of $12 million), and the realization of
certain procurement and production cost synergies (increase of $14 million). These increases were primarily offset
by the effect of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced Gross profit by $12 million. The
remainder of the variance in Gross profit was primarily attributable to changes in volume and mix.

Segment profit increased by $46.1 million, or 19.9%, to $277.3 million for the year ended September 30,
2020, compared to segment profit of $231.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in
Segment profit of P&P was primarily driven by the flow through impact of Gross profit (increase of $70 million),
offset by the net increase in cash operating expenses of a recurring nature (non-recurring costs such as severance and
transaction specific costs are excluded from the calculation of Segment profit) of $25 million. The net increase in
recurring cash operating expenses was comprised of incremental incentive compensation accruals (increase of $36
million), and the incremental costs related to the full year consolidation of the heritage BASF P&P business relative
to the eight month post-acquisition period of 2019 (increase of $32 million), offset by the impact of certain longterm and short-term cost reductions taken in response to COVID-19 to preserve profitability (decrease of $22
million), the realization of cost synergies identified as part of the pre-acquisition due diligence process specific to
BASF P&P (decrease of $13 million), as well as the effect of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced
Segment profit by $10 million.

Net sales increased by $69.2 million, or 8.8%, to $859.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020
compared to Net sales of $790.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by incremental Net sales of heritage BASF materials of $83 million resulting from the incremental
four months of consolidated BASF P&W results in 2020 relative to the eight month post-acquisition period of 2019.
Additionally, the increase in Net sales was partially attributable to increases in pricing primarily related to the
recapture of historical changes in raw material costs of $15 million, offset by the effect of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates which reduced Net sales by $18 million. The remainder of the variance in Net sales was
primarily attributable to changes in volume.

Gross profit increased by $41.7 million or 18.9%, to $262.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020
compared to gross profit of $220.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2019. The increase in Gross profit was
primarily driven by incremental sales of heritage BASF P&W materials (increase of $20 million), the effect of
increases in pricing which were primarily related to the recapture of historical changes in raw material costs
(increase of $15 million), the impact of raw material deflation (increase of $26 million), and the realization of
certain procurement and production cost synergies (increase of $7 million). These increases were primarily offset by
the effect of fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates which reduced Gross profit by $6 million. The remainder
of the variance in Gross profit was primarily attributable to changes in volume and mix.

Reverse supply agreements is a new commercial unit conceived as a result of the JV. As such, the RSA
business has no results prior to our acquisition of the BASF P&W business on January 31, 2019. This business unit
is comprised of the aggregated business results of our Reverse supply agreements which require us to provide
finished goods to BASF at a cash cost consistent with their legacy internal costing. These relationships enable BASF
to continue servicing the businesses that they retained after the closing of the JV. Because of the nature of these
agreements, the sales price to which we are entitled is generally below that which would we would receive in an
orderly third-party transaction, and generally results in limited Gross profit and Segment profit margins. While the
finished goods produced and sold under Reverse supply agreements are within our core operations and can
otherwise be ascribed to our other commercial units, we have elected to evaluate these results separately because we
do not have discretion over the timing or frequency whereby BASF will order these materials and lack the ability
under the terms of the agreements to determine pricing for these transactions. As the inclusion of these results in our
other operating segments would compromise the usefulness of the financial results, this commercial unit will be
separately reported until the underlying agreements expire and we reassert the opportunity to charge prices
commensurate with true costs and operating margins consistent with other market participants.

The increased profitability of our RSA business in 2020 is not expected to continue on a long-term basis
and was driven in part by the current year release of prior year reserves for potential claims from our customers that
ultimately were settled in full in normal course during 2020.

Net sales increased by $297.4 million, or 22.2%, to $1.6 billion for the year ended September 30, 2019
compared to Net sales of $1.3 billion for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in Net sales was
primarily driven by the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water which increased Net sales of Pulp & Paper by $302
million. Additionally, Net sales of Pulp & Paper increased by $32 million and $11 million, driven by increases in
pricing and the incremental full- year impact of our prior acquisitions of Topchim and CBC, respectively. These
increases were offset by the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which reduced Net
sales of Pulp & Paper by $51 million. The remaining variance was primarily driven by changes in sales volume and
mix.

Gross profit increased by $45.5 million, or 10.6%, to $474.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2019
compared to Gross profit of $429.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in Gross profit was

million. In addition, Gross profit of Pulp & Paper increased by $6 million resulting from the impact of price
increases, net of raw material price inflation, as well as by $3 million resulting from the full-year impact of our prior
year acquisitions. These increases were offset by the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and
well as the impact of non-cash purchase accounting and other inventory adjustments which reduced Gross profit of
Pulp & Paper by $16 million and $11 million, respectively. The remaining variance was primarily driven by changes
in sales volume and mix.

Segment profit increased by $33.1 million, or 16.7%, to $231.2 million for the year ended September 30,
2019, compared to Segment profit of $198.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in
Segment profit of Pulp & Paper was primarily driven by the flow through impact of Gross profit (increase of $46
million), increase of depreciation and amortization within Cost of sales ($20 million), plus the non-cash purchase
accounting and inventory adjustments impact ($11 million), offset by the incremental Selling, general and
administrative expense (net of realized cost synergies) and exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $40 million
related to the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water.

by the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water which increased Net sales of IWT by $228 million.

Additionally, Net sales of IWT increased by $17 million driven by increases in pricing. These increases
were offset by the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which reduced Net sales of
IWT by $20 million. The remaining variance was primarily driven by changes in sales volume and mix.

Gross profit increased by $18.2 million or 9.0%, to $220.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2019
compared to Gross profit of $202.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase was primarily
driven by the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water which contributed Gross profit to IWT of $35 million. In addition,
Gross profit of IWT increased by $1 million resulting from the impact of price increases, net of raw material price
inflation. These increases were offset by the impact of non-cash purchase accounting and other inventory
adjustments as well as the negative impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which reduced Gross profit of
IWT by $8 million and $6 million, respectively. In addition, inventory provisions reduced Gross profit by $5
million. The remaining variance was primarily driven by changes in sales volume and mix.

Segment profit increased by $26.1 million, or 52.6%, to $75.8 million for the year ended September 30,
2019 compared to Segment profit of $49.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2018. The increase in Segment
profit for IWT was primarily driven by the flow through impact of Gross profit (increase of $18 million), increase of
depreciation and amortization within Cost of sales ($10 million), plus the non-cash purchase accounting and
inventory adjustments impact ($8 million), offset by the incremental Selling, general and administrative expense
(net of realized cost synergies) and exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $25 million related to the
acquisition of BASF Paper & Water. Exclusive of the impact of the acquisition of BASF Paper & Water, Segment
profit of IWT increased by $12 million versus the period year driven primarily by the restructuring of our IWT
business which primarily reduced our recurring Selling, general and administrative expense.

**Non-GAAP Financial Metrics**

To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following
non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance; EBITDA, Segment
profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows. We believe that the presentation of
these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that
these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by
excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We use certain of these financial
measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We
utilize Segment profit as the primary measure of our segment specific performance.

**_Reconciliation of Net (Loss) to EBITDA and Segment profit_**

EBITDA consists of net (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Segment profit consists
of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, non-recurring or
other items that are included in net (loss) and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating
performance and (iii) certain unusual or non-recurring items impacting results in a particular period. We believe that
making such adjustments provides investors with meaningful information to understand our operating results and
ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis.

We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that
of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA and Segment profit may vary from that of other
competitors in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to income before income
taxes, net (loss), or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of
operating performance.

EBITDA and Segment profit have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in
isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitation are:

EBITDA and Segment profit:

      - Do not reflect the significant interest costs relative to our first and second lien term notes as well as
our revolving credit facility;

      - Eliminate the impact of income taxes from the results of our operations;

      - Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and
amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Segment profit do not
reflect any expenditures for such replacements; and

      - Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Segment profit differently than we do,
limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.

We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Segment profit along with other comparative
tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S.
GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, and net (loss) amongst other performance metrics.

In evaluating these financial measures, one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses
similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Segment profit should not be
construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

The following table reconciles Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Segment profit (in thousands):

**_Reconciliation of Cash Flows_**

Adjusted net operating cash flows and Adjusted net investing cash flows consists of reported Net cash
(used in) provided by operating activities and Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, each adjusted for
the effects of cash subsequently received as part of our Accounts Receivable Financing. Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) 2016-15 requires us to evaluate the transfer of title of receivables sold under Accounts Receivable
Financing against cash received on previously-sold receivables in exchange for the transfer of title. Since there is a
dichotomy between when we legally transfer title of receivables to ING Luxembourg S.A. (“ING”) or MUFG Bank,
Ltd (“MUFG”) under the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement or MUFG Receivables Purchasing Agreement,
respectively, and when the cash received on previously-sold receivables, receivables are deemed transferred in
exchange for a beneficial interest in the collection of that receivable. This is considered a non-cash investing
activity. Furthermore, ultimate receipts of cash, when settled with ING or MUFG, are considered cash flows from
investing activities, as the receipt is considered a return of capital on the beneficial interest.

We believe that this may cause Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and Net cash provided
by (used in) investing activities to be potentially misleading to investors. While Solenis UK International does not
retain legal ownership of the receivables sold, the nature, timing, and extent of cash flows have not materially
changed as a result of the agreement. We use these Non-GAAP metrics to assess our own liquidity.

The following table reconciles Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to Adjusted net operating
cash flows and Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities to Adjusted net investing cash flows (in
thousands):


**Year Ended September 30,**


**Nine Months Ended**

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

We believe our ability to generate cash from operations and our access to capital markets will be sufficient
to meet anticipated cash requirements to fund working capital, capital spending, acquisitions, debt maturities, and
other cash needs. Our liquidity needs are expected to be met through a variety of sources, including: cash provided
by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, available credit lines, and long term debt markets. We believe that
Solenis’ current financial position, liquidity, and credit ratings will provide sufficient access to capital when
necessary.

The following is a summary of our cash position and total outstanding debt as of June 30, 2021 and
September 30, 2020 (in thousands):

**As of June 30, 2021** **As of September 30, 2020**

Cash and Cash Equivalents ............................................................... $ 246,566 $ 253,990
Total Debt and Finance Leases .......................................................... 2,396,698 2,443,446

133


-----

Total debt and finance lease obligations decreased by $46.7 million from $2,443.4 million as of September
30, 2020 to $2,396.7 million as of June 30, 2021. The net decrease was primarily driven by principal repayments of
$73 million on our First Lien Loans, finance lease obligations and Equipment Financing obligations, offset by an
unfavorable foreign exchange impact of $12 million and the amortization of deferred financing costs and original
issue discount of $10 million.

We had $363.7 million of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2023 as of June 30,
2021. This amount consisted of $375.0 million less undrawn standby letters of $11.3 million.

The following represents a summary of our adjusted Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for
the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):

**For the Nine Months Ended June 30,**
**2021** **2020** **Variance**
Adjusted net operating cash flows ............................................ $ 154,418 $ 116,896 $ (37,522)
Adjusted net investing cash flows ............................................ (87,949) (60,942) (27,007)
Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities .................. (82,799) 187,408 (270,207)
Effect of currency rate changes on cash ................................... 9,233 (5,864) 15,097

Total change in cash and cash equivalents ............................... $ (7,097) $ 237,498 $ (244,595)

**_Operating Activities_**

Adjusted net operating cash flow for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was $154.4 million, a decrease
of $37.5 million compared to $116.9 million of cash inflows for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. This decrease
was primarily attributable to the increase in Segment profit between periods of $60.9 million, offset primarily by
incremental cash usage of working capital primarily driven by the timing and magnitude of incentive compensation
payouts and timing of VAT payments.

The following table presents a rollforward of our net proceeds from the Accounts Receivable Financing
facilities via ING and MUFG (in thousands). As of June 30, 2021, we have drawn $138.3 million under the
programs and have an existing available capacity of $67.6 million.

**Net proceeds from**
**ING and MUFG**

As of September 30, 2019 ........................................ $ 119,507

Activity ..................................................................... (13,493)

Currency Translation Adjustments ........................... 4,083

As of September 30, 2020 ........................................ $ 110,097

Activity ..................................................................... 25,908

Currency Translation Adjustments ........................... 2,282

As of June 30, 2021 .................................................. $ 138,287

**_Investing Activities_**

Adjusted net investing cash flow for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was a use of $87.9 million, an
increase of $27.0 million compared to a cash use of $60.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. This
increase was primarily driven by incremental cash paid for acquisitions and other long-lived assets of $23 million, in
addition to incremental capital expenditures of $4.0 million.

**_Financing Activities_**

Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was cash use
of $82.8 million compared to cash provided of $187.4 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020, a decrease

134


-----

of $270.2 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to the relative debt proceeds obtained and principal
obligations repaid during the nine month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. During the nine months ended June
30, 2021, we repaid $73 million of debt and finance leases whereas during the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we
obtained a net $201 million of debt proceeds primarily driven by a $200 million drawdown in March 2020 on our
revolving credit facility in response to COVID-19.

**_Effects of Currency Rate Changes on Cash_**

The effect of currency rate changes on cash for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was a favorable
impact of $9.2 million, compared to an unfavorable impact of $5.9 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020.
This increase was attributable to the relative appreciation and depreciation of the functional currencies of our global
operating entities relative to the U.S. dollar and the timing of cash movements during the respective periods then
ended.

**_Contractual Obligations and Scheduled Maturities_**

The table below presents our total contractual obligations under operating leases and scheduled maturities
relative to our external debt and finance lease obligations on a historical basis as of June 30, 2021 (in thousands) and

obligations...................................................... [ $ ] 61,545 $ 580,870 $ 2,316,064 $ 561,928 $ 3,520,407

The amounts presented above reflect principal obligations and cash interest only and exclude amounts for
non-cash interest such as the accretion of the debt discount and the amortization of deferred financing costs relative
to our First and Second lien loans. Projected interest payments reflected in the table above assume no future
principal payments outside of the normal repayment terms and assume no borrowings on the Revolving Credit
Facility until it is due in December 2023 (fiscal year 2024).

**Other Matters**

During the first quarter of 2019, Solenis entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge
variable interest rate risk exposure specific to Solenis’ First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate
notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million in the aggregate. As a result of these

135


-----

arrangements, Solenis collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating
three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.27%, 3.13%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36-month period
from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022. Our total outstanding debt subject to variable interest rates is in excess of
the notional value of our interest rate swaps. As such, we are subject to additional interest rate-risk that may increase
our debt service costs in the future.

As of June 30, 2021, we do not have any unreserved contingent liabilities that management believes are
reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of
operations, cash flows, or liquidity. We have no material commitments outside our normal course of business.
Additionally, there are no relevant legal matters for which a loss is both probable, and estimable, for which we have
not accrued as of June 30, 2021.

Net income (loss) .......................................................................................... $ 18,362 $ (29,816)

_Net sales_

Net sales of $363.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $38.0 million over the six
months ended June 30, 2020. Higher Net Sales were driven by increased volumes in North America of $30.8 million,
increased volumes in South Africa of $3.8 million, and favorable global pricing of $11.3 million compared to the same
period in 2020. The impact from translational foreign exchange was an additional $6.5 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.

_Gross profit_

Gross profit of $116.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 increased by $30.5 million over the
six months ended June 30, 2020. Gross profit increased by $13.5 million due to increased volumes, $12.4 million due
to favorable pricing, $3.2 million due to favorable freight and distribution costs, and $2.2 million of translational
foreign exchange compared to the same period in 2020.

_Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses of $73.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021
decreased by $5.8 million over the six months ended June 30, 2020. The six months ended June 30, 2021 had $11.1
million of lower expenses related to transition, transaction, and restructuring costs from the separation of the business
from Lonza, $1.1 million higher selling and marketing costs and $3.9 million higher administrative, finance, and IT
expenses compared to the same period in 2020.

Other expense of $18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 declined by $13.5 million from the
six months ended June 30, 2020 largely attributable to lower transactional foreign currency exchange on intercompany
loans of $6.5 million. The six months ended June 30, 2021 had $13.5 million lower other non-operating other income
(expense) driven by the sale of Surface Water and a decrease in interest expense of $2.2 million compared to the same
period in 2020.

**_For the year ended December 31, 2020_**

**_Net sales_**

Net sales of $587.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $10.9 million over the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Higher Net Sales driven by increased pricing and volumes in the North
American residential business of $44.6 million were partially offset by lower Global Water Treatment volumes of
$22.6 million due to COVID-19 impact on commercial markets and unfavorable translational foreign exchange of
$11.1 million.

**_Gross profit_**

Gross profit of $153.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $47.0 million over the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The twelve months ended December 31, 2019 included a one-time
expense for acquisition accounting of $22.7 million. Gross profit increased due to favorable price and
customer/product mix of $21.0 million and higher sales volumes of $4.9 million, in addition to lower raw material
and freight and distribution costs of $3.5 million partially offset by unfavorable translational foreign exchange of
$5.1 million.

**_Selling, general and administrative expenses_**

Selling, general and administrative expenses of $159.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020
decreased by $15.8 million over the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The twelve months ended December
31, 2019 included a one-time expense for strategic consulting costs of $8.2 million. Lower business expenses of $6.9
million due to lower marketing expenses and lower travel and entertainment and favorable translational foreign
exchange of $3.1 million partially offset by higher costs in administration and research and development costs of
$2.4 million.

**_Other Expenses_**

Other operating expenses of $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $130.5
million from the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 due to the $113.8 million non-cash impairment charge to
write off the carrying value of our goodwill in 2019 and lower transaction and restructuring expenses of $16.6
million. Other expense of $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $26.3 million from the
twelve months ended December 31, 2019 largely attributable to a $30.8 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our
Surface Water operations partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $3.0 million and an increase in
transactional foreign exchange of $1.5 million.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Overview_**

Sigura’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from the ordinary course of business and
availability under the Revolving Credit Facility described below. Sigura expects these sources will fund its ongoing
cash requirements for operating activities.

**As of December 31,** **As of June 30,**
**2020** **2021**

Leverage
First Lien Term Loan ....................................................... $ 353,700 $ 351,900

Total Liquidity ........................................................................ $ 107,500 $ 125,300

**_Cash Flows_**

**_For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2021_**

Cash used for operating activities of $24.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 was consistent
with the six months ended June 30, 2020. Cash used for operating activities is mostly attributed to the change in
inventories of $13.2 million and trade receivables of $57.9 million partially offset by net income of $18.4 million.
Overall net working capital changes were an $8.0 million increase for the six months ended June 30, 2021 compared
to the same period in 2020.

**_For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019_**

Cash generated by operating activities of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased
$74.2 million from the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Cash generated by operating activities is mostly
attributed to an increase of net income of $219.3 million over the prior period, higher amortization and depreciation
of $8.5 million and higher changes in working capital of $7.9 million partially offset by lower adjustments for noncash items during the year ended December 31, 2020 of $161.5 million. The changes in working capital during the
year ended December 31, 2000, excluding the impact of the sale of our Surface Water operations, included a
decrease in trade receivables of $12.0 million, a decrease in inventories of $13.0 million, partially offset by an
increase in accounts payable and accruals of $3.9 million. The non-cash items for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2019 included goodwill impairment, inventory step-up and loss on sales of plant, property and
equipment.

**Credit Facilities**

**_Term Loan Credit Agreements_**

The $360 million Sigura First Lien Term Loan matures in February 2026 and the $100 million Sigura
Second Lien Term Loan matures in February 2027. In total, under the term loan credit agreements, Innovative Water
Care Global Corporation is required to remit approximately $0.9 million of principal payments each quarter.

140


-----

**_Revolving Credit Agreement_**

The $125 million Sigura Revolving Credit Facility matures in February 2024. The Sigura Revolving Credit
Facility is subject to a borrowing base and is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions,
distribution payments, working capital and other corporate purposes.

Sigura will be required to make prepayments when and to the extent the aggregate amount of outstanding
loans and letters of credit under the Sigura Revolving Credit Facility exceeds the lesser of the aggregate amount of
commitments in respect of the Sigura Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowing base. Any interest payments are
due the earlier of quarterly or in accordance with the specific period borrowed.

**Sale of Surface Water**

On October 2, 2020, Sigura completed the sale of the assets and liabilities related to our Surface Water
operations for aggregate consideration of $44.1 million. The divestiture of the Surface Water operations has not
been classified as a discontinued operation because the disposition does not represent a strategic shift that will have
a major effect on our operations and financial statements.

**Combined Company Overview**

We believe that the combination of Solenis and Sigura will create a global market leader across all water
intensive industries. We believe that we will be well-positioned to benefit from growing Environmental, Social and
Governance (“ESG”) and macroeconomic mega trends, including around customer sustainability goals and focus
points, such as: water recycle and energy and raw material management, consumer focus on hygiene, environmental
legislation globally, increased levels of shipping and packaging, among others. Together, we will offer a diverse,
comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, which will limit any obsolescence risk as no product or solution
represents a material part of our business. Our cutting edge technology is at the forefront of the digitization of the

water treatment industry and we have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products that drive significant value
for our customers. We will operate across a diverse set of growing end markets and our broad geographic reach
allows us to meet the needs of our customers globally. Our footprint spans six continents, with both laboratories and
production facilities across North America, LatAm, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve all major developed
markets and are closely integrated with our customers throughout the world. Through our global presence and
differentiated service offering in growing markets, we believe we will be an industry leader in all of our segments.

The following graphic summarizes the geographic reach of laboratories and production facilities of the
combined Solenis company following the Transactions.

We believe our business exhibits highly attractive financial characteristics, including significant recurring
revenues, improving margin profile and substantial free cash flow conversion. The combined Solenis company will
provide greater scale to capture tailwinds from growing end markets. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021,
we generated pro forma Net sales and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After Synergies) of $3,491 million
and $613 million, inclusive of $40 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions taken within 18
months of the closing of the Transactions, respectively. We believe our combined earnings profile will generate
significant free cash flow, which we expect will be used to support growth initiatives and drive de-leveraging.

We believe the Transactions create an opportunity to realize meaningful synergies resulting from the
integration of Solenis and Sigura in addition to standalone cost savings at Solenis from management plans already
underway. We expect to realize approximately $40 million of synergies from integration related to the consolidation
of support functions and sales teams, sourcing of direct materials, and consolidation of facilities between the two
businesses, from actions taken within 18 months of the closing of the Transactions. Additionally, Solenis, along with
Platinum, has identified approximately $72 million in annual run-rate cost savings related to raw material sourcing
capabilities at Solenis, pricing and mix optimization, shared service and indirect spend optimization, and 4-wall
improvement on controllable costs at existing facilities from additional actions taken within four years of the
Transactions closing. We believe the total synergy and cost savings plan represents an approximately $113 million
opportunity based on actions implemented over the first four years from the closing of the Transactions. However,
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these synergies or operational improvements. For more
information on anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may impact our ability to achieve such synergies
or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Reorganization—The
anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and the Reorganization may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize
than expected, which may adversely affect our results of operations.”

**_Pool Solutions Segment_**

Our Pool Solutions segment offers water care solutions and value-added services for residential and
commercial pools and spas. The water treatment process begins with testing, which requires testing for a pool’s pH
and chlorine levels on a weekly basis. The next step is balancing, i.e., maintaining certain levels of pH, total
alkalinity and calcium hardness. Sanitizing, which is keeping water clean and disinfected, is most frequently done
using stabilized chlorine products. Specialty maintenance products such as algaecides and clarifiers are typically
used on a semi-monthly basis, in addition to the normal sanitizing process, to target specific pool needs such as
algae prevention or stain control. Lastly, shock treatment can be used to address one-off pool care needs, especially
following inclement weather and high pool usage.

We are a leading producer of pool chemicals for the residential and commercial markets worldwide and
provide various water treatment products including shock, sanitizer, specialty maintenance products, and test strips.
Our offerings include a full suite of products and applications aimed at public pools, health clubs, aquatic parks,
hotels, motels, apartments and condominiums in the form of water-soluble pods, convenient floaters and automatic
feeders. Our portfolio of brands includes iconic brands such as HTH®, Poolife® and GLB®. We believe we are the
world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment and sanitation.

We believe we are one of only two players with a complete brand and product offering in the U.S. pool and
spa chemicals market and we believe we are the only player with a truly global offering. We have total market
access to all residential channels from Mass Retail (41% of Pool Solutions Net Sales for the twelve months ended
June 30, 2021) to Professional Dealer (48% of Pool Solutions Net Sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021)

**Customers and Suppliers & Procurement**

_Customers_

We serve a large base of customers across a diverse set of end markets. Our customer base includes many
of the top paper and industrial players across our Industrial Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments, including
WestRock, International Paper, and Marathon Petroleum and across big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Leslie’s
Poolmart in our Pool Solutions segment. We believe that the combination of Solenis and Sigura will further reduce
customer concentration. The top five customers for the combined Solenis company are expected to represent
approximately 13% of total sales with the largest customer representing 4% of the combined company sales.

At Solenis today, the top five customers represent approximately 15% of total Net sales with the top three
customers representing approximately 11%. No Solenis customer represents more than approximately 5% of total
sales. Historically, large accounts have grown 1.5x faster than the base business, driven by collaboration with
customers on new technology development, embedded service engineers and focus on consistent delivery and
service. At Sigura today, customer concentration has been relatively higher than that of Solenis due to large
corporate accounts and big-box retailers. Sigura is expected to increase direct-to-consumer sales and convert new
dealers over the next several years, which is expected to significantly reduce dependency on big-box retailers.

We believe our customer base is inherently sticky, attributable to the mission critical nature and service-led
models that we provide, leading to highly recurring, non-discretionary spend on Solenis’ products and services.
Solenis’ on-site technicians, employees and equipment at customer locations create high switching costs and
disruption risk. As a result, we believe Solenis’ Net sales is 95% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and
value proposition.

The following graphic summarizes our already low customer concentration, set to become even less
concentrated as a result of the combination of Solenis and Sigura.

We source materials from multiple suppliers creating low supply chain concentration. Only approximately
12% of total spend is sole-sourced and more than 50% of the sole-sourced material is a specialty additive that is
sourced from BASF where Solenis takes all of the production. On April 30, 2021, Solenis, CD&R and BASF agreed
to extend those supply agreements that are applicable to certain products that are critical to Solenis’ supply chain,
which will now expire eight years following the Acquisition Closing Date. Currently more than 85% of Solenis’
products are produced in-house, which has increased from approximately 70% since 2014 at the time of the initial
carve-out transaction from Ashland, and which Solenis plans to continue to increase in the next five years.
Additionally, there are several initiatives underway to drive insourcing for Solenis that will be implemented
following the Transactions to drive productivity and cost savings.

Our largest raw material spend includes Acrylonitrile (6% of total spend), DETA (3%), Chlorine & Caustic
Soda (2%), Epichlorohydrin (2%), and Adipic Acid (2%), resulting in total expenditure in the top five materials of
15% or $203 million. The top five key suppliers represent 36% of total expenditure, or $498 million, with the top
two representing 27% of total expenditure.

The following graphic summarizes our expenditure on raw materials and to key suppliers for the twelve
months ended June 30, 2021.

**Industry Overview**

**_Specialty Chemicals – Consumer_**

The consumer market is comprised of water treatment chemicals and solutions for pulp and paper specific
process applications (e.g., strength additives and sizing agents across wet-end/dry-end of paper process). Based on a
report by a third party expert advisor completed in June 2021, the global consumer market was estimated to be
approximately $8 billion in 2020.

The Packaging market is one of the key market segments within the consumer market that can be broken
into consumer packaging and food packaging. Based on the same report, the consumer packaging market was
estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 3.4% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030,
which we believe will be driven primarily from the growth of e-commerce and megatrends in pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics and beauty. Approximately 18% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021
was generated from the consumer packaging market. Based on the same report, the food packaging market was
estimated to be $1.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030,
driven by increased demand for ecofriendly packaging and changing lifestyles centering on more take-away and
individually packed food. We believe the shift away from plastic and the growth in the barrier coating market, which
is not included in the market size estimate, may drive additional growth in food packaging over this period.
Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was generated from the
food packaging market.

The Graphic & Specialty Paper market has been adversely impacted by the continued substitution of
printed material with electronic media. Reduced use of commercial office spaces in Europe and North America as a
result of COVID-19 is also a negative factor for the sector outlook. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market, based on
the same report, was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to decline at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year
from 2020 to 2030. However, we have limited exposure to newsprint, which accounts for less than 2% of Consumer
Solutions sales, and we are shifting our focus to higher margin products to offset the expected volume decline in this
market. Approximately 11% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was generated
from the Graphic & Specialty Paper market.

The Tissue & Towel market is benefiting from strong demographic/socioeconomic trends and increasing
hygiene standards, especially in developing markets. However, stagnating population growth in some mature
markets, and cost-cutting in the public sector and private company spending is expected to limit global market

150


-----

growth. The Tissue & Towel market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2020 and is
expected to grow at a 2.6% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030. Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net
sales for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was generated from the Tissue & Towel market.

**_Specialty Chemicals — Industrial_**

The industrial market supplies water treatment chemicals and solutions for heavy and light industries and
municipalities (e.g., cooling tower, boiler, influent/effluent, process water). Broadly speaking, the industrial market
consists of core water treatment which includes end markets such as pulp, mining and oil and gas, and wastewater,
which includes end markets such as municipal and industrial wastewater markets.

Based on the same report, the global industrial market was estimated to be approximately $23 billion in
2020 and is expected to grow at a 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025. The municipal market is
expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report, as demand
continues to increase from higher per capita usage of water, population growth and increasing regulatory demands.
The core water treatment market growth is expected to be driven by increasing sustainability and environmental
policies, growing regulatory demands and global industrial growth. This growth is expected to be highest in the food
and beverage market (5.5% CAGR for the five year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report) and the
refining and petrochemicals market (4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same
report).

**_Pool_**

The aftermarket for the residential pool industry is comprised of three main segments: (1) Chemicals, (2)
Equipment, Parts, and Accessories and (3) Services. Our main focus is on the Chemicals segment which is the
largest and most stable component of aftermarket pool spend.

Pool chemicals sales are tied to: (1) the pool installed base and (2) total gallons of treatable water, and not
new builds. The U.S pool installed base has displayed long-term stability as it has consistently grown for decades,
including all years through the housing-led recession and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is
providing current tailwinds for the business. However, new builds account for less than 4% of the installed base
annually, meaning that new build rates are unlikely to materially impact our long-term performance.

The Pool Solutions segment also benefits from a stable aftermarket spend that mirrors the steady dynamic
of the installed base. Our chemical-based products result in 100% aftermarket exposure, which reduces our exposure
to cyclical industry trends such as housing starts. Pool chemical use is entirely non-discretionary in that it is a
requirement for owning and using a pool. Pool owners who have already made the significant upfront investment of
constructing a pool, estimated to cost $40,000 to $100,000, will continue to purchase pool chemicals, at the de
minimis annual expense of only $300 to $400 in order to maintain their pools.

Based on data contained in the Pkdata US Residential Swimming Pool Market Report (2020), the market
for chemicals for U.S. residential pools was estimated to be $2.6 billion in 2020. While according to the same
Pkdata report, the market is expected to grow at a 3+% CAGR in the five-year period 2020 – 2025, we believe our
Pool Solutions segment will grow in excess of that as we expand our customer base and increase market share with
new dealer relationships and e-commerce channel.

market leader in specialty chemicals for the Consumer Solutions segment with an estimated 20% of global market
share, based on Net sales. Based on the same report, we believe that we maintain market leadership positions in
almost all technologies and regions. The competitive landscape, as segmented by geography or technology, remains
fragmented. We have particularly strong market positions in process chemicals within the biocide, contaminant
control, defoamer, tissue specialties and pulp specialties technologies.

Our strength is based on the complete product portfolio, premium product performance and strong technical
support we offer. We believe we have the best and the broadest offering to help customers achieve their operational
efficiencies. We are a trusted supplier known for our data analytics capacities, with focus on service excellence,
sustainability, productivity and cost savings for our customers.

Certain competitors, such as Ecolab / Nalco and BASF have reduced their focus on the pulp and paper
market. Kemira is the only global competitor that has stated its intention to invest in the market. We believe we are
well positioned to not only remain the market leader but also expand our leadership position. With no obvious
consolidator and more than a hundred market participants, the market presents a significant consolidation
opportunity.

-----

Many customers are starting to embrace digital technology / data analytics to help track performance and
starting to partner with suppliers with strong R&D capabilities to develop innovative solutions to drive efficiency
and achieve sustainability objectives. This trend is expected to continue and we expect to benefit from it due to our
robust value-added chemistry and technology solutions offering.

_Industrial Solutions_

The global industrial water chemicals market is fragmented, with the top seven players, of which we are
one, covering only approximately 30% of the market, based on a report by a third party expert advisor completed in
June 2021. This is due to the required application-specific expertise and track-record of performance. Hence, by
region and by end-user market, three to five players may have disproportionately high share. We believe we have an
outsized share of the global pulp and paper market, which is one of our larger markets within the Industrial
Solutions segment.

We believe we offer the lowest per unit cost for comparable chemicals compared to our industry peers and
believe that the competitive pricing is our greatest strength in the Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we
offer an array of innovative solutions and comprehensive product lines both in core water treatment and wastewater
segment. Notable competitors include Ecolab / Nalco, Suez, ChemTreat, Kurita, Kemira and SNF. Ecolab which
acquired Nalco in 2011 is the largest water treatment player followed by Suez.

Similar to the consumer market, technology and R&D are becoming increasingly important beyond the
chemical product itself as customers are moving towards advanced analytics to optimize the volume of chemical
treatment, driving select industry participants to increasingly focus on equipment / engineering solutions as opposed
to chemical solutions.

_Pool Solutions_

We believe we are the only true global player in the Pool Solutions segment with leading market positions
in North America, South America, and EMEA. Our primary competitor in this segment is KIK Custom Products,
which provides various pool chemical solutions, with a focus on North America. Other smaller competitors also
compete in this market, with varying breadth and geographical focus, including Hasa Pool, Jandy, Lo-chlor and
Jack’s Magic.

We believe we are the world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment
and sanitation. All three of our cal-hypo facilities are co-located with chlor-alkali producers meaning that raw
materials (chlorine and caustic soda) are delivered into our production plants via a direct pipeline. We believe this is
a major competitive advantage and barrier to entry in the Pool Solutions segment as we believe it would not be
economical for our competitors to open a new cal-hypo facility that is not co-located with a supply of raw materials.

**_Sustainability and Environmental and Social Governance_**

We drive sustainability by reducing water and energy use and raw materials waste while improving
operational productivity. Increased focus on sustainability and ESG is a key trend across both Consumer Solutions
and Industrial Solutions segments and is driving demand as our customers aim to reduce water and energy
consumption, optimize raw materials spend and reduce waste emission. These objectives require increased chemical
use which is driving increased demand for our business.

At the micro level, we provide solutions to customers with specific sustainability goals. For example, our
offering of PFAS-free oil and grease resistant technology has been selected by major brand owners as a replacement
in food service bowls. We also made a series of recommendation to a petroleum company which resulted in a
reduction of 162 million gallons of water per year and approximately $45,000 of savings per year on energy and
chemicals. Our management is dedicated to, and focused on, building and marketing our strong ESG reputation,
shifting to green products and providing value-added services to help our customers achieve their sustainability
targets.

153


-----

Focus on solving customers’ environmental and sustainability challenges has led to notable results for
Solenis. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2020, (1) 84% of innovation projects in the pipeline had
sustainability / circularity focus, (2) 84% of Net sales was driven by projects that support customers’ sustainability
goals, (3) 12% of innovation programs focused on Carbon footprint projects, (4) CO2 emission was reduced by 16%
from the twelve months ended September 30, 2019 and (5) we had an Environmental Incident Classification (EIC)
score of 75, which was a 12% improvement from the twelve months ended September 30, 2019.

We are also focused on long term sustainability goals for our business that include: (1) over 50% of raw
material suppliers to be compliant with sustainable procurement, (2) 20% reduction in CO2 emissions, (3) 5%
reduction in water consumption, (4) over 80% of our revenues to support our customers’ sustainability goals, (5)
100% of our plants to be ISO 9001, RC14001 and SEDEX certified, (6) to have a 5% return on investment from
every commercial person focusing on reduction in energy, water and raw materials as well as improved productivity
and (7) water consumption to be reduced by 5% from the twelve months ended September 30, 2018 by 2030.

**Summary of Operational Improvements and Synergies Initiatives**

We, along with Platinum, have identified synergies resulting from the combination of Sigura and Solenis.
We expect to achieve an estimated $40 million in annual cost synergies from actions taken within 18 months of the
closing of the Transactions. The synergies are expected to be realized through consolidation of support and sales
functions, materials sourcing and facility consolidation.

  - Approximately $33 million of cost synergies are expected to be achieved through Sigura’s back office
consolidation into Solenis, as well as consolidation of the Sigura industrial sales organization.

  - Approximately $3 million of cost synergies relate to leveraging Solenis’ infrastructure and resources to
better drive Sigura’s direct materials sourcing through spend scaling.

  - Approximately $4 million of cost synergies are attributable to warehouse and distribution center
optimization as well as the consolidation of Sigura’s Alpharetta facility.

To achieve the identified synergies, we expect to incur approximately $28 million of one-time costs. The
majority of these one-time costs are related to implementation support with the balance related to severance and
other integration costs to ensure business continuity.

Additionally, we, along with Platinum, have identified operational improvements at the existing Solenis
business, resulting from plans from management that are currently underway. We expect to achieve an estimated
$72 million in annual cost savings based on actions implemented over the first four years from the closing of the
Transactions. The cost savings are expected to be realized through raw material sourcing capabilities at Solenis,
pricing and mix optimization, shared service and indirect spend optimization, and 4-wall improvement on
controllable costs at existing facilities.

  - Approximately $31 million of cost savings are expected to be achieved through improvement in sourcing
capabilities at Solenis.

  - Approximately $20 million of cost savings relate to driving pricing adherence to above floor pricing and
our ability to shift margin mix away from lower margin business.

  - Approximately $14 million of cost savings are attributable to expanding the scope of share service
organization (India and Poland) while driving savings in indirect spend categories.

  - Approximately $8 million relate to focus on reducing controllable costs at plants and facilities.

To achieve the identified synergies, we expect to incur approximately $25 million of one-time costs. The
majority of these one-time costs are related to implementation support and other costs to ensure business continuity.

These initiatives will be executed by a dedicated implementation team with support from Platinum
operational executives and third-party resources. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve
these synergies or operational improvements. For more information about our anticipated synergies, including
certain factors that may affect our ability to achieve such synergies or operational improvements. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Reorganization—The anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and
the Reorganization may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, which may adversely
affect our results of operations.”

**Competitive Strengths**

_Leading Provider in Growing Water Intensive Industrial, Consumer & Pool Markets_

We believe the size of our total addressable market is $39 billion and that the market is relatively
fragmented, with the top six players holding only approximately 40% market share, presenting an opportunity for us
to capture share. Our combined platform will create a scaled leader across all water intensive industries. Based on a
report by a third party expert advisor completed in June 2021, we believe that we have that we have the #1 market
position in the Consumer Solutions segment and are one of the top market players in the highly fragmented
Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we believe we are one of two top players in the U.S. pool and spa
chemicals market.

We serve a variety of growing diverse water-intensive end markets, including consumer chemicals
(estimated by a third party expert advisor to grow at 1.8% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030), industrial
chemical (estimated by a third party expert advisor to grow at 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025),
and pool and spa (estimated by the Pkdata US Residential Swimming Pool Market Report (2020) at 3%+ CAGR).
We have a comprehensive portfolio of solutions including Biocides, Antifoams, Raw and Waste Water treatments,
and Deposit Control, among others for our customers to address their needs in these growing end markets.

_Global Leader with Diverse Sticky Customer Base_

We have a large geographical footprint that enables us to provide global service to our customers. We are
present on six continents, with both laboratories and production facilities, across North America, LatAm, EMEA,
and APAC, where we serve all major developed markets. At Solenis, we have more than 5,200 employees with a
substantial presence across the North America, LatAm, EMEA, and APAC regions. At Sigura, we have a global
footprint in all key pool and water care regions, with approximately 1,000 employees globally across operations and
retail channels. Our strategic global footprint allows us to efficiently and effectively serve customers around the
world by providing consistent products and service.

Our service and technical abilities are mission critical to our customers. Typically our trained value-add
employees, scientists, and service engineers are embedded at customers’ sites, creating strong and long-term
relationships. We represent a lower overall percentage of our customers’ cost base and have been able to achieve
significant value add documented savings for our customers. We are highly engrained in our customers’ workflow,
and it is often difficult, expensive, and potentially disruptive for customers to switch to a competitor. As a result,
more than 95% of Solenis’ Net sales is recurring. Sigura’s Net sales are 90%+ driven by established, branded
products that carry strong customer recognition and loyalty and unique potential in their geographic end markets.
Further, our customer concentration is low with the top five customers representing approximately 13% of pro forma
combined company sales and the top customer represents approximately 4% of Net sales.

_Differentiated Business Model with Best in Class Service, Chemistry, and Technology_

We believe our suite of comprehensive products and services unlocks customer value as a result of our
industry leading employees and innovative technology offerings. Our solutions represent a small portion of our
customers’ overall end costs and provide a significant return on investment. Our differentiated service model, with
over 1,500 of our sales and service engineers on site with our customers, leads to highly recurring, non-discretionary
spending on our products and services, and with our solutions and value propositions including industry leading

155


-----

technology, Solenis was able to achieve $194 million of value-add documented savings for our customers in the
twelve months ended September 30, 2020.

We offer innovative chemistries to address customers’ operational and sustainability challenges while our
technology is at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry. Further, we have product
development capabilities to meet customers’ new and evolving needs, based on three main pillars. First, we have
260 dedicated research and development professionals with two-thirds of our annual technology spend supporting
those efforts. Second, our innovation pipeline includes approximately 50 projects, representing significant potential
run-rate revenue, and we have approximately 2,000 patents, including patents for chemical and equipment
technologies. Lastly, our strategically located facilities around the world focus on analyzing and diagnosing products
and processes, as well as conducting testing to recommend effective improvements that enhance both productivity
and quality for our customers. This is critical as new and innovative products carry a higher than average margin and
this mix shift is expected to drive increased profitability for our business.

_Attractive Financial Profile with Strong Top Line Growth, Expanding Margins, and Robust Free Cash Flow_
_Generation_

Our global business has shown strong topline growth, with over 95% of Solenis’ Net sales being recurring
in nature, with the core business growing during the COVID-19 pandemic. By optimizing our cost structure through
a strict focus on maximizing operational efficiencies through new technologies, reducing redundancies and
leveraging existing infrastructure, we have seen improved Adjusted EBITDA growth and attractive margin
expansion. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After
Synergies) margin was approximately 18%. Our topline growth and impressive margin expansion with low working
capital intensity and minimal capital expenditures allow for significant free cash flow generation. See “Summary—
Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data.”

_Long Tenured, Industry leading Management Team with Strong Track Record_

We have an experienced management team with long tenures in the industry and experience in the sector.
Following consummation of the Transactions, the combined company will be led by John E. Panichella, who has
been CEO of Solenis since its inception in 2014, following the initial carve-out from Ashland. Through organic
growth and M&A, particularly the merger with BASF, Panichella has steered Solenis to global leadership in the
specialty chemicals for water-intensive industries. Prior to leading Solenis, John served as President of Ashland
Water Technologies, SVP of Ashland, Group Operating Officer of Ashland Specialty Ingredients and Ashland
Water Technologies, and President of Ashland Aqualon Functional ingredients. Surrounding John is a deep bench
across operations, technology, commercial and finance, including Philip M. Patterson, Jr, current CFO of Solenis
(and who will be CFO of the combined Solenis company following the Transactions), Andreas Tuerk, present and
continuing President of the Consumer Solutions business, Edward Connors, present and continuing President of the
Industrial Solutions business, and Robert Baird, current CEO of Sigura (and who will be President of the Pool
Solutions business following the Transactions). Solenis’ experienced team will drive long-term stability of the
combined business and support future growth.

**Growth Strategy**

We believe we are well positioned to grow organically and capture share through several distinct strategies.
Supportive end market trends that drove historical growth are expected to continue over the next five to ten years.
We have successfully maintained strong pricing discipline to offset inflationary increases to input costs and shift
customers to a more profitable mix, driving margin growth. The combination creates unique, value accretive
synergy opportunities, with line of sight on approximately $40 million of cost synergies (resulting from actions
taken within 18 months of the closing of the Transactions) and an additional approximately $72 million of
operational improvement opportunities within the combined Solenis company (based on further actions
implemented over the first four years from the closing of the Transactions). Our new partnership with Diversey will
allow Solenis access to a greater portion of the attractive Food & Beverage market.

We are also well positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions via multiple M&A avenues. We have
a proven track record as an M&A platform, with 11 transactions completed since 2014, including the transformative

156


-----

2019 merger with BASF’s water and paper business. We believe there is opportunity for both strategic bolt-ons and
transformational targets going forward.

_Well positioned to grow with macro and ESG mega trends_

We believe our sophisticated product development capabilities meet our customers’ evolving needs and
help keep us at the forefront of macroeconomic trends. Our ability to evolve is based on three pillars that allow us to
grow our product offering alongside client demands: R&D, Innovation and Customer Application Laboratories. Our
R&D team has 260 dedicated professionals and two thirds of annual technology investment supports R&D. Our
robust innovation pipeline currently has approximately 40 projects and features approximately 2,000 patents,
including those for chemical and equipment technologies. Customer application laboratories are strategically located
facilities around the world focused on analyzing and diagnosing products and processes, as well as conducting
testing to recommend effective improvements that enhance both productivity and quality.

We focus on solving our customers’ environmental and sustainability challenges, placing us at the forefront
of the ESG mega trend. Through identification of specific goals such as reduction of water consumption, reduction
of energy consumption, reduction of waste emissions or optimization of raw materials utilization, we have been able
to work with customers to meet their unique needs. Our sophisticated capabilities have helped customers meet
evolving sustainability goals and achieve measureable results.

_Pricing discipline to drive margin growth_

We have a track-record of actively monitoring and managing prices, enabling the pass-through of raw
material cost increases to maintain margins. Through Solenis’ value-documentation program, sales teams have
accountability requirements to show that at least 5% of Net sales is value advantage to customers, which enables
price capture even in deflationary environments. This has enabled us to pass through a majority of increases in raw
chemical materials, which are one of the major drivers for cost inflation, to customers by adjusting prices
accordingly. As a result of recent increases in raw material prices, Solenis has executed over 26,000 price increases
between February and July 2021. The charts below summarize our success in implementing price increases and
maintaining price ahead of cost.

Solenis’ well-established process and systems will help continue driving pricing actions for the legacy
Sigura business. Over the last two years, Sigura has aggressively taken price in the market, including over 20% in
key channels to price ahead of cost challenges in the market. In addition, Sigura management has undergone a
significant effort to streamline and simplify the business and supply chain, reducing total SKUs from approximately
3,300 to approximately 1,300 and consolidating from 16 to nine North American brands.

We believe there is also further margin upside from mix shift-up in our business. Over the last two years
Solenis has realized strong margin uplift through a combination of reduced costs, price increases and shift away
from selling commoditized products. Approximately 70% of Solenis’ SKUs have seen a margin uplift, through a

combination of reduced costs and price increases. We are intentionally reducing sales of lower margin or more
commoditized products and increasing sales of higher margin or more proprietary products, thereby improving total
margins. In order to drive profitability, Solenis set price floors for all of its products and has successfully reduced
the percentage of Net sales from below floor products from 27% for the first fiscal quarter of 2020 to only 15% in
the second fiscal quarter of 2021.

Below Floor Price Above Floor Price

_Note: Data reflects historical Solenis business only_

Our goal is to have no more than 5% or approximately $150 million of Net sales from products sold at
below floor pricing. We have a dual strategy to achieve this goal: (1) leverage value documentation for top accounts,
which represent approximately 40% of annual below floor sales, to raise prices or improve our profitability mix and
(2) for our smaller accounts (representing less than $10 million per year), we plan to: (a) continue our trade up
strategy for polyacrylamides product line, (b) trade up technologies in Graphic & Specialty and Packaging markets
to improve our customers’ performance and our margins and (c) conduct price increases in all other product lines.

_Enhance profitability through identified synergies and operational improvements_

We believe that through the realization of the synergies and operational improvement initiatives, which we
have identified together with Platinum, we will enhance our profitability and support our strategic initiatives. The
approximately $40 million of synergies was identified with the collaboration of the Solenis and Sigura management
teams, along with Platinum, and reflect actions we believe can be implemented within 18 months of the closing of
the Transactions. The approximately $72 million of operational improvements at Solenis reflect plans that
management had already identified and we believe we will now be able to more effectively and efficiently
implement those actions under Platinum’s leadership (based on actions implemented over the first four years from
the closing of the Transactions). The Platinum team has an extensive track record of leveraging its operational
resources to achieve anticipated cost savings.

We cannot assure you we will be able to achieve all of these cost synergies and operational improvements.
For more information about our anticipated cost synergies and operational improvements, including certain factors
that may affect our ability to achieve such cost synergies and operational improvements. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Acquisition and the Reorganization—The anticipated benefits of the Acquisition and the
Reorganization may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, which may adversely affect
our results of operations.”

_Increase market reach through partnership with Diversey_

We believe that our newly signed exclusive partnership with Diversey will allow us to reach a greater
portion of the attractive food and beverage market. The partnership will allow us to provide water treatment
products to Diversey to be marketed to Diversey’s existing customer base within food and beverage. We will supply
water products, training and technical expertise, including R&D, while Diversey will pay total cost plus mark-up.

The total addressable food and beverage chemicals market is approximately $2.2 billion. We expect to realize
additional manufacturing absorption benefits as a result of this relationship.

_Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions_

While our primary focus is on organic growth, our global presence, scale and broad product offering
position us well to execute on opportunistic acquisitions given the large and fragmented nature of the markets we
serve or to expand into new markets. We estimate that the markets adjacent to our market represent a total market
size of $42 billion and represent potential expansion areas, including the ion exchange and coagulants markets. We
believe that we can create significant value through strategic acquisitions given our track record of integration.
Solenis has completed 11 acquisitions since 2014, including the transformative and successful merger with BASF’s
water and paper business in 2019. We will focus on maintaining a disciplined acquisition strategy centered on: (i)
expanding our customer base in new and growing end markets and geographies; (ii) improving our customer
offering through access to new products and technological capabilities; and (iii) generating significant purchasing
and other operational synergies.

**Combined Solenis Company Business Resegmentation**

Following a strategic review related to Solenis’ operating segments and in anticipation of the closing of the
Acquisition and the Reorganization, changes will be introduced in the segment reporting from October 1, 2021. To
ensure comparability, Solenis has prepared condensed segment reporting presented on the basis of the new business
segmentation (i) for the three months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020 and
(ii) for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 compared to the nine months ended June 30, 2020. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Solenis—Segment Results.”

The segmentation changes are being made for the following reasons: (i) alignment of the segment structure
to ensure that the combined Solenis company’s financial reporting segments are in line with its strategic approach in

160


-----

demarcating its operations and (ii) in order to most effectively manage the combined Solenis company and make
business decisions based on product lines and services.

Major changes relate to: (i) the creation of a new Pool Solutions segment to account for the contribution of
Sigura’s Pools segment, focused on delivering products for the treatment of pools, spas and water parks, (ii) the
renaming of the Pulp & Paper business as the Consumer Solutions business, (iii) the renaming of the Industrial
Water business as the Industrial Solutions business, (iv) the reallocation of the food processing aspects of the
business from the newly named Industrial Solutions business to sit with the other consumer-based products and
services within the newly named Consumer Solutions business, (v) the reallocation of the pulp processing aspects of
the business from the newly named Consumer Solutions business to sit with the other industrial-focused products
and services within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment, (vi) the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial &
Municipal Water business to the newly named Industrial Solutions segment and (vii) the inclusion of Solenis’ RSA
business within the newly named Industrial Solutions segment.

**_Consumer Solutions._** The Pulp & Paper segment of the historical Solenis business will be renamed the
Consumer Solutions segment of the combined Solenis company. The Consumer Solutions segment is mostly
affected by the removal of Pulp and its reallocation to the Industrial Water segment (now renamed the Industrial
Solutions segment).

**_Industrial Solutions._** The Industrial Water segment of the historical Solenis business will be renamed the
Industrial Solutions segment of the combined Solenis company. The Industrial Solutions business is mostly affected
by the inclusion of the RSA segment, the removal of Food and its reallocation to the Pulp & Paper segment (now
renamed the Consumer Solutions segment) and the contribution of Sigura’s Industrial, & Municipal business.

**_Pool Solutions._** Sigura’s Pool segment, including residential and commercial pools, will form the new Pool
Solutions business segment of the combined Solenis company.

**Sustainability Strategy**

Global demand for solutions that save water, use less energy, eliminate waste, and convert everyday
products to more sustainable materials is continuing to grow. As a leader in sustainability, Solenis has been helping
its customers tackle these complex challenges for more than 100 years.

Global trends show that sustainability strategies are becoming strong differentiators for businesses and that
stakeholders are increasingly interested in how key Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues are
managed. ESG covers a broad set of issues, from the carbon dioxide footprint to labor practices to corruption.
Consumers and employees are demanding higher standards of sustainability and quality of employment. Regulators
and policy-makers are also interested in sustainability, and they see the corporate sector as a key player in the
journey toward achieving sustainable development.

One of the most relevant environmental issues for the chemical industry is the management of water
resources. As freshwater sources like rivers or lake become increasingly stressed, the chemical industry is working
with other sectors to increase water efficiency and to reduce water use in their operations and value chain.
Businesses are also investing in recycling technologies, as well as incorporating renewable and recyclable materials
in their product portfolio.

With a water treatment heritage of more than a century, helping customers meet their environmental goals
has always been one of the company’s highest priorities. Sigura supplies advanced product technologies to support
the sustainability of water, energy and the protection of critical water management assets. The combination of
Solenis and Sigura will enable the combined Solenis company to expand its presence across markets, to increase its
customer base and to reinforce its position as a sustainability leader.

In 2020, with a view to advancing our sustainability goals and commitments, we carried out a materiality
assessment to identify the most material topics to stakeholders and the business. The aim was to identify ways to
enhance the company’s existing sustainability efforts, improve transparency and disclosure, look for more

161


-----

opportunities to drive sustainable solutions and improve operational efficiency and productivity. Although involved
in numerous sustainability initiatives for many years, the materiality assessment helped to inform the development
of the company’s strategic sustainability approach going forward, organizing its actions and commitments across
four focus areas:

**_Wellbeing, Health & Safety of Our People. Our long-standing reputation for solving highly complex_**
customer challenges is directly attributed to our approximately 5,200 outstanding professionals, including 1,600
field representatives, working in 120 countries across five continents. It is our ambition to educate and engage our
employees to reach their full potential and to create a safe and inclusive work environment in which they can
continuously grow and succeed, and this is prioritized in our approach to culture, health and safety, diversity and
inclusion, and training and development.

**_Protecting our Planet. In our operations, our focus is on ensuring responsible stewardship of the natural_**
environment, by focusing on climate change and energy use initiatives, supporting circular economy and material
use principles (increasing the contribution of recycled materials to overall materials demand), promoting water
management and waste and pollution management and enabling our customers to manage resources and
manufacturing processes more effectively. This includes continuing to ensure that all our sites meet, or exceed, all
regulatory and environmental requirements, keeping abreast of changing applicable environmental laws and
regulations, and providing products and services to our customers to help them meet, or exceed, their own
environmental objectives.

**_Partnerships in Our Value Chain. Given our global reach, we recognize our responsibility towards_**
employees, customers, suppliers, governments, investors and the local communities of which we are part. We are
dedicated to responsibly managing relationships with our key stakeholders. An important element of this is
partnering with employees to help address the needs of the communities where we operate and collaborating with
our suppliers to increase transparency and sustainability in our supply chain.

**_Responsible Business Practices. We focus on operating with the highest ethical standards in all aspects of_**
our business and protecting the rights and interests of all our stakeholders, individually and collectively. We treat
personal data confidentially, adhering to effective policies and procedures securing lawfulness, fairness,
transparency, integrity and confidentiality of personal data entrusted to Solenis by our employees, customers,
suppliers, business partners and other individuals with whom we work. We are recognized globally for our legacy of
technology innovation and we invest in developing new chemistries to improve customers’ products and processes.
In 2020, Solenis embarked on a digital transformation effort focused on enhancing the customer experience using
digital solutions.

Our ambition for the future is to create more value for all our stakeholders while consuming less, thereby
minimizing our impact on the environment and society. Supporting our customers in their sustainability journeys
will always be central to our business. However, going forward we will also look inward, with a focus on
consumption reduction and on product development with sustainability at its core.

Following completion of the Transactions, the Sigura business will be integrated into these sustainability
goals and commitments.

**Impact of COVID-19**

Although the COVID-19 pandemic presented us with many hurdles to overcome, we achieved considerable
business successes through our business agility and creative approaches to solving customer problems. During the
pandemic, the business remained strong, owing to the essential markets we serve, which include consumer
packaging, tissue and towel, municipal and many other essential goods producers. These customers have ongoing
needs for products and services to protect water and production assets. For consumer-related manufacturing, such as
bath tissue and packaging for e-commerce, our customers increased production significantly in response to demand
driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences.

162


-----

In addition, COVID-19 has accelerated and driven many trends and changing behaviors globally, one of
which is the concept of “cocooning.” This has resulted in a greater focus on the home environment, which has
translated into increased residential pool builds in the North American and European geographies. Additionally,
greater focus on home entertainment and health has increased residential pool usage and maintenance, which has
positively impacted the demand for pool chemicals. A downside experienced from COVID-19 is the reduction in
tourism and travel, which has resulted in a negative impact on commercial pool usage and resulted in decreased
chemical usage in commercial pools.

Overall, we believe that the positive impact on residential pools chemical usage during the COVID-19
pandemic has outweighed the negative impact to the commercial pools chemicals usage.

We continued to observe strong market trends driving growth in sustainability, recycling, water reuse and
plastic conversion to fiber. We are moving numerous programs through our R&D processes to put new services and
products in the hands of our commercial team.

**Environmental Matters**

Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the
environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among
other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety.
We maintain reserves for any anticipated liabilities pertaining to environmental laws and regulations. The total
reserves for environmental remediation, reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an
extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to
any third-party recoveries. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that
affect our ability to estimate our share of any such costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of
contamination at any site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely
varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing
improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible
parties at multiparty sites.

As of both June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, Solenis had recorded environmental remediation
reserves of $1.8 million, related to two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. Of the $1.8
million reserved, $1.0 million relates to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination
associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million relates to management’s best estimate for
potential exposure related to ground contamination at Solenis’ Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a
potential Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management’s
then-current best estimate of total expenses to be incurred, made with the assistance of a third-party specialist.

We are not currently aware of any other material environmental liabilities or other material environmental
issues at our properties or arising from our current operations. However, we cannot assure you that such liabilities or
issues will not materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations in the future.

We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe
that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a
material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition.

**Competition**

Our business competes on the basis of its demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, chemical
formulations, customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and metering equipment.
Our principal competitors include Ecolab (Nalco), Kemira and SNF.

We believe that we are well positioned to compete in our markets. In particular, we believe Solenis’
differentiated product portfolio, with strong intellectual property, gives us a real competitive advantage. We
executed a clear strategy around several growth vectors, including corporate accounts, emerging markets, new

163


-----

technologies, focused investment in water-intensive industries and polyacrylamide (PAM) manufacturing
capabilities investment — and all showed good returns.

Our scale provides a competitive benefit when compared with the smaller local or regional competitor
providers, as we are able to leverage our distribution network to service smaller customers in a cost-effective way.
We also differentiate from our competitors through (i) the breadth of our offering — Solenis is one of three global
players with a full portfolio of water-intensive industry solutions, with best-in-class dosing and dispensing
technologies and advanced analytics to optimize the processes for the customer, (ii) our delivery of a total solution
to customers — operating as their trusted advisor in assessing operational efficiencies and leveraging our network of
experts to solve customers’ most difficult problems on a time-critical path through our fast track laboratories, (iii)
our commitment to constantly developing our portfolio to improve products, our development of new technologies
to deliver increased customer savings, and our addition of new product categories to meet more customer needs, and
(iv) the expertise of our workforce — who are highly trained in focused industries, and the majority of whom are
embedded in customer facilities.

**Personnel**

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had approximately 6,296 employees
worldwide directly supporting our operations with approximately 1,847 employed in the United States. As of June
30, 2021, 142 of our employees in the United States, representing 7.7% of our employees in the United States, were
subject to collective bargaining agreements. These collective bargaining agreements are negotiated with various
unions representing our employees. Our employees are at the heart of our mission and strategies, and to drive both,
we focus on our culture.

**_Our Culture. Our mission is to strive to be each customer’s most trusted supplier. Our solutions drive_**
sustainability by reducing water and energy use and raw material waste while improving operational efficiency and
productivity. At its core, our focus is on profitable sustainability. Our culture is centered on fundamental beliefs
around the importance of our people, continuous performance improvement and creating positive experiences in our
interactions for every customer to fuel the growth of the business. Solenis brings together diverse perspectives in a
safe, collaborative workplace that empowers our employees to solve the world’s most challenging process and
sustainability challenges. We nurture a culture of inclusion and accountability and promote learning and
development of all employees.

**_Health & Safety. We continuously strive to be a leader in health and safety. Our long-term ambition is to_**
operate with zero injuries. To support this ambition, we have set a target to reduce our total recordable incident rate
by at least 10% versus the prior year.

**_Diversity & Inclusion. A diverse workforce is integral to deliver our strategy. By embracing the unique_**
strengths of each person and respecting and promoting differences, we believe that we can build the most effective
teams and enhance Solenis’ performance across our global operations. Our ambition is to double the number of
diverse people in the company by 2030.

**_Training and Development. In addition to recognizing and rewarding our employees for their_**
achievements, we offer continuous learning and development opportunities. We proactively focus on creating
personalized development plans for every individual, ensuring that joining Solenis — and staying with us — leads
to a rewarding career that focuses on lifelong learning as well as personal and professional growth opportunities.

**Intellectual Property**

We strategically manage our portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other
intellectual property. Specifically, we rely upon trade secrets to protect the formulation of many of our chemical
products, as well as our manufacturing processes. We own or have licenses under patents and trademarks which are
used in connection with our business. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulations and
processes used to manufacture our products.

164


-----

As of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to the Transactions, we held 259 U.S. patents, 1,719 foreign
patents, and 45 U.S. and 563 foreign pending patent applications.

The trademarks of major products in each business are registered in key jurisdictions or licensed from third
parties. Certain intellectual property is also protected by confidentiality agreements or other agreements with
suppliers, employees and other third parties. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued
protection of these trademarks, patents and trade secrets.

We do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual trade name,
trademark or patent.

**Properties**

Our corporate headquarters are located at: Wilmington, Delaware in a leased office of approximately
87,640 square feet. Solenis has more than a 100 locations worldwide which is a combination of manufacturing
facilities, R&D centers, laboratories, offices and warehouses. Most of the manufacturing facilities are owned and
most of the R&D centers are co-located with a manufacturing facility. Other properties are leased where we have
typically a long term lease agreement for the material locations. Sigura has more than 25 locations worldwide, which
are a combination of manufacturing facilities, R&D centers, laboratories, offices and warehouses.

The following chart identifies the number of owned and leased facilities and properties as well as aggregate
approximate square footage by type, other than the corporate headquarters listed above, used by us as of June 30,
2021. We believe that all of our facilities are well maintained and are suitable and adequate for our current needs.

__________

(a) Solenis currently has a tenancy at will over two sites at Fuetingsweg 20, Krefeld, Germany which, if
terminated, would not have a material impact on Solenis’ business. Solenis is in the process of purchasing
one site and relocating the other to a site over which it has another lease.

**Legal Proceedings**

In addition to the matters described above (see “—Environmental Matters”), there are various claims,
lawsuits and administrative proceedings that are pending or threatened. Such actions seek remedies or damages,

166


-----

some of which are for substantial amounts. Solenis has accrued for legal reserves of $3.3 million as of both June 30,
2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. While Solenis cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such
actions, Solenis believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to
such actions.

In addition to its uncertain tax positions, Solenis has accrued for various contingent liabilities related to
indirect taxes. As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, Solenis has accrued for potential exposure related to
these positions of $5.7 million, of which Solenis is indemnified for $3.6 million by the former owners of Solenis’
business combinations since inception.

In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, Solenis is a defendant in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties and is subject to
inquiries and investigations by various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, we
cannot state with confidence what the timing, eventual outcome, or eventual judgment, damages, fines, penalties or
other impact of these pending matters will be. We believe, based on our current knowledge, that the outcome of the
legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pending should not have a material adverse effect on Solenis’
financial condition.

Sigura is subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Based on information
currently available, it is the opinion of Sigura management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened
legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash
flows. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such
matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on Sigura’s results of operations, financial position, or
cash flows.

**About Parent and the General Partner**

Parent is a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership that was formed and registered under the
Exempted Limited Partnership Act (as amended) (“ELP Act”) on June 29, 2021.

A key feature of an exempted limited partnership is that it is not a separate legal person distinct from its
partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any rights or property of an exempted limited partnership (whether held in that
partnership's name or by any one or more of its general partners) shall be held or deemed to be held by the general
partner (in the case of Parent, this will be the General Partner), and if more than one by the general partners jointly,
upon trust as an asset of the exempted limited partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement.
Any debts or obligations incurred by the general partner in the conduct of Parent’s business are the debts and
obligations of the Parent. In the event that the assets of the Parent are inadequate, the General Partner will be liable
for all such debts and obligations of the Parent.

Registration under the ELP Act entails that the exempted limited partnership becomes subject to, and the
limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability (subject to the partnership agreement) and other benefits of,
the ELP Act.

As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be liable for the debts and
obligations of the exempted limited partnership save (i) as provided in the partnership agreement or otherwise

169


-----

agreed, (ii) if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership’s business and holds himself
out as a general partner to third parties or (iii) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to section 34 of the ELP
Act to return a distribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent and the limited partner has
actual knowledge of such insolvency at the time of such distribution.

The General Partner was incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted limited company on June 29, 2021.
The business of the Parent will be conducted by the General Partner.

**DESCRIPTION OF NEW CREDIT FACILITIES AND OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

The following is a description of our New Credit Facilities that we will enter into in connection with the
Acquisition. The following summary of certain provisions of the New Credit Facilities does not purport to be
complete and may not contain all of the information that is important to you, and is subject to, and qualified in its
entirety by reference to, all of the provisions of the corresponding agreements. All terms of the New Credit Facilities
described herein are subject to the marketing process and remain subject to change.

**New ABL Revolving Credit Facility**

On the Acquisition Closing Date, we expect to enter into our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Our
New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will be available to the Issuer and certain of its affiliates that are designated as
co-borrowers therein and provide for senior secured asset-based, multi-currency revolving loans, swingline loans
and letter of credit availability in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500 million, subject to borrowing base
capacity. Letters of credit will be limited to the lesser of (a) an amount to be agreed and (b) the aggregate unused
amount of commitments under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility then in effect, subject to borrowing base
capacity. Bank of America, N.A. will act as administrative agent and collateral agent for our New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility. Our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will mature five years after the Acquisition Closing Date.
We expect to use borrowings under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility (a) on the Acquisition Closing Date, (i)
to fund certain original issue discount and upfront fees, (ii) to replace, backstop or cash collateralize existing letters
of credit and similar instruments of the Issuer and certain of its affiliates, (iii) for working capital needs, earn-outs,
or purchase price adjustments under the Acquisition Agreement, (iv) to finance the Closing Date Cash Purchase (as
such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement) (which shall not exceed $175.0 million) and (v) for
any other purpose permitted by the lenders under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility and (b) after the
Acquisition Closing Date, for working capital and general corporate purposes and borrowings and issuances of
letters of credit.

Borrowings under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will be limited by borrowing base calculations
based on the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and unrestricted cash,
minus the amount of any applicable reserves. Borrowings will bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either an
adjusted Eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin or, at our option, a base rate plus an applicable margin. We may
borrow on the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility only up to the lesser of (i) the level of our then-current
borrowing base and (ii) our committed maximum borrowing capacity of $500 million. Subject to certain conditions,
our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility may be expanded by up to the greater of (a) the greater of (i) $250 million
and (ii) a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement) of
Parent and its restricted subsidiaries for the most recent twelve-month period that will be equal to a percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA as of the Acquisition Closing Date equaling the equivalent of $250 million and (b) the excess
of the borrowing base at such time over the aggregate commitments under the New ABL Revolving Credit Facility
at such time. Our ability to draw under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility or issue letters of credit thereunder
after the Acquisition Closing Date will be conditioned upon, among other things, our delivery of prior written notice
of a borrowing or letter of credit request, as applicable, our ability to reaffirm the representations and warranties
contained in the New ABL Credit Agreement in all material respects and the absence of any default or event of
default thereunder.

Our obligations under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will be guaranteed by Parent and its direct
and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain permitted exceptions, including exceptions based on
immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries) as well as certain of
Parent’s direct and indirect wholly owned foreign subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions where borrowing base
assets are located (subject to certain permitted exceptions; provided that no foreign Subsidiary shall guarantee any
obligations of any U.S. entity). As detailed in the immediately succeeding sentence, our New ABL Revolving Credit
Facility will be secured by a lien on substantially all of Parent’s, the Issuer’s and each of their direct and indirect
wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries’ current and fixed assets (subject to certain exceptions), as well as certain assets of
certain of their direct and indirect wholly owned foreign subsidiaries; provided that no foreign assets shall secure
any obligations of any U.S. entity. Our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will have a first-priority lien on the
Current Asset Collateral (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement) and a second-priority
lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit Agreement) (second in

priority to the liens securing our New Term Loan Facility discussed below), in each case, subject to other permitted
liens.

The following fees will be applicable under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility: (a) an unused line fee
of (i) 0.375% per annum of the unused portion of our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any swingline
loans) when the average daily unused portion of such facility is less than 50% of the aggregate commitments under
our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) 0.250% per annum of the unused portion of our New ABL
Revolving Credit Facility when the average daily unused portion of such facility (excluding any swingline loans) is
equal to or greater than 50% of the aggregate commitments under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility, (b) letter
of credit fees of (i) a participation fee equal to the applicable margin for adjusted Eurodollar rate loans, as
applicable, in each case, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit under the New ABL Revolving
Credit Facility and (ii) a fronting fee equal to 0.125% on the average daily amount of undrawn and unreimbursed
letters of credit per annum and (c) certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders, letter of credit issuers
and agents thereunder. Subject to customary provisions for discretionary and protective overadvances, we will be
required to make prepayments under our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility at any time when, and to the extent
that, the aggregate amount of the outstanding loans and letters of credit under our New ABL Revolving Credit
Facility exceeds the then applicable borrowing base.

Our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will contain customary covenants, including, but not limited to,
restrictions on our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to merge and consolidate with other companies,
incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay
dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter
into transactions with affiliates or certain burdensome agreements, modify our governing documents or certain
junior debt documents or change our line of business. Our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will require the
maintenance of a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (to be set forth in the New ABL Credit Agreement) of
1.00 to 1.00 (tested for the four fiscal quarter period ending on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter
for which financials have been delivered, and at the end of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter) during any
period commencing on the date when Adjusted Availability (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit
Agreement) is less than the greater of (a) 10% of the Line Cap (as such term shall be defined in the New ABL Credit
Agreement) and (b) $25 million and ending on the date on which Adjusted Availability has exceeded the greater of
10% of the Line Cap and (b) $25 million for at least 30 consecutive calendar days.

Our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility will provide that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default,
our obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated. Such events of default
include payment defaults to the lenders thereunder, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant
defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material
money judgments, pension-plan events reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, certain change of control
events and other customary events of default, subject to certain materiality levels, default triggers, cure and grace
periods and/or baskets.

**New Term Loan Facility**

On the Acquisition Closing Date, we expect to enter into our New Term Loan Facility with Goldman Sachs
Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other arrangers and lenders, which will be fully
drawn to fund, in part, the Acquisition, and will be available to the Issuer in the amount of approximately $1,400
million, subject to exchange rates and sizing between the Dollar and Euro tranches.

Subject to certain conditions, our New Term Loan Facility, without the consent of the then-existing lenders
(but subject to the receipt of commitments), may be increased (or new incremental term loan facilities added) in an
aggregate principal amount for all such increases, incremental facilities and certain incremental equivalent debt of
no greater than (a) the greater of (x) $600 million and (y) 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (as such term shall be
defined in the New Term Loan Credit Agreement), plus (b) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments,
repurchases and redemptions of, among other things, pari passu term loans borrowed under the New Term Loan
Credit Agreement and certain other indebtedness, plus (c) an unlimited amount, so long as on a pro forma basis,
either (1) the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as such term shall be defined in the New Term Loan
Credit Agreement) either (x) would not exceed the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio as of the Acquisition

173

Closing Date or (y) at the election of the Issuer if incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or other
permitted investment, would not increase or (2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as such term shall be defined in
the New Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not less than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio prior to such increase.

Our loans incurred under the Dollar tranche of our New Term Loan Facility will amortize in equal quarterly
installments in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the principal amount. The interest rate margin applicable to
borrowings under the Dollar tranche of our New Term Loan Facility will be, at our option, either (1) the base rate
(which is the highest of (x) the then-current federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus
0.50%, (y) the prime rate on such day and (z) the one-month LIBOR for a period commencing on such date plus
1.00%) plus an applicable margin or (2) one-, three- or six-month LIBOR or, if agreed to by all relevant lenders, 12month LIBOR or any shorter period (selected at our option) plus an applicable margin. The Dollar tranche under our
New Term Loan Facility is expected to be subject to a LIBOR floor.

Our loans incurred under the Euro tranche of our New Term Loan Facility will not have scheduled
amortization payments prior to maturity. The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the Euro tranche of
our New Term Loan Facility will be either one-, three- or six-month EURIBOR or, if agreed to by all relevant
lenders, 12-month EURIBOR or any shorter period (selected at our option) plus an applicable margin. The Euro
tranche under our New Term Loan Facility is expected to be subject to a EURIBOR floor.

We may voluntarily prepay loans under our New Term Loan Facility, in whole or in part, subject to
minimum amounts, with prior notice but without premium or penalty (other than, subject to certain exclusions, a
1.00% premium on any prepayment in connection with a repricing transaction prior to the date that is six months
after the Acquisition Closing Date).

We will be required to prepay our New Term Loan Facility with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales
and casualty events relating to our assets (other than Current Asset Collateral), the incurrence or issuance of
specified refinancing indebtedness or any indebtedness not permitted under the New Term Loan Facility and 50% of
excess cash flow, in each case, subject to certain reinvestment rights, thresholds, step-downs and other exceptions.

Our obligations under our New Term Loan Facility will be guaranteed by Parent and its direct and indirect
wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain customary exceptions, including exceptions based on
immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries). Our New Term Loan
Facility will be secured by a lien on substantially all of Issuer’s and each of the New Term Loan Facility guarantors’
current and fixed assets (subject to certain exceptions), and our New Term Loan Facility will have a first-priority
lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral and certain material real property and a second-priority lien on the Current Asset
Collateral (second in priority to the liens securing our New ABL Revolving Credit Facility discussed above), in each
case, subject to other permitted liens.

Our New Term Loan Facility will contain customary negative covenants generally consistent with those
applicable to the Notes, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries
to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make
acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay dividends or other restricted payments, make investments, sell or
otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter into transactions
with affiliates or certain burdensome agreements, modify our governing documents or certain junior debt documents
or change our line of business.

Our New Term Loan Facility will provide that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our
obligations thereunder may be accelerated. Such events of default will include payment defaults to the lenders
thereunder, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other
material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, unpaid material money judgments,
pension-plan events reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, change of control and other customary
events of default subject to certain materiality levels, default triggers, cure and grace periods and or baskets.

Delaware corporation, (ii) the term “Parent” refers to Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership, acting through Olympus Water Holdings Limited, its general partner, the direct parent
of the Issuer and (iii) the terms “we,” “us” and “our” each refer to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
immediately following the Acquisition (as defined below) and the Reorganization (as defined below). Certain
defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions” have the meanings
assigned to them in the Unsecured Indenture (as defined below).

The Issuer will issue $      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Dollar
_Unsecured Notes”) and €      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Euro Unsecured_
_Notes” and, together with the Dollar Unsecured Notes, the “Unsecured Notes” and each, a “Series of Unsecured_
_Notes”). The Unsecured Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (as amended_
and supplemented from time to time, the “Unsecured Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined
below) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”). The Dollar Unsecured
Notes and the Euro Unsecured Notes will each be issued as a separate Series of Unsecured Notes, but, except as
otherwise provided below, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Unsecured Indenture. The
Unsecured Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to registration under the Securities Act,
and the Unsecured Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to any of the provisions of the TIA. The Issuer
does not intend to list the Dollar Unsecured Notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer intends to apply to list the
Euro Unsecured Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) following the
Issue Date. There is no assurance that the Euro Unsecured Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the
Exchange, and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Unsecured Notes
will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Unsecured Notes is not contingent on the Issuer
making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

The Issuer will issue $      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the
“Dollar Secured Notes”) and €      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro
_Secured Notes” and, together with the Dollar Secured Notes, the “Secured Notes”). The Secured Notes will be_
issued pursuant to an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (as amended and supplemented from time to time,
the “Secured Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,
N.A., as trustee (the “Secured Notes Trustee”) and collateral agent (the “Notes Collateral Agent”). The Dollar
Secured Notes and the Euro Secured Notes will each be issued as a separate Series of Secured Notes, but, except as
otherwise provided therein, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Secured Indenture. The
Secured Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to registration under the Securities Act, and
the Secured Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to any of the provisions of the TIA. The Issuer does not
intend to list the Dollar Secured Notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro
Secured Notes on the Exchange following the Issue Date. There is no assurance that the Euro Secured Notes will be
listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the
listing of the Euro Secured Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Secured Notes is
not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. See
“Description of Secured Notes.”

This offering is expected to be consummated on     , 2021 (the “Issue Date”), which is expected to be
prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization. It is, however, possible,
that the completion of the Acquisition and the Reorganization may be delayed until after the Issue Date. In that case,
unless the offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, pending
consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited), on the Issue Date, (i) an amount
in cash equal to the gross proceeds from the sale of the Dollar Unsecured Notes into a segregated escrow account
(the “Dollar Escrow Account”) and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds from the sale of the Euro
Unsecured Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Euro Escrow Account” and, together with the Dollar
Escrow Account, the “Escrow Accounts”), in each case, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the “Escrow
_Agreement”), dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee, the Secured Notes Trustee, and The Bank of_
New York Mellon, as Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agent”). An affiliate of Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC
(“Platinum”) will issue an irrevocable equity commitment letter to the Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the

176


-----

Secured Notes Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Unsecured Notes, that will require such affiliate of
Platinum, (x) in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction
of the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined below), to transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the
Dollar Unsecured Notes, or euros, in the case of the Euro Unsecured Notes, to the Issuer that is sufficient to fund the
accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders of such Unsecured Notes and (y) in the event of a Special
Mandatory Redemption (as defined below), to transfer to the Issuer (i) an amount of cash in U.S. dollars necessary
to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Dollar Unsecured Notes and (ii) an amount of cash in
euros necessary to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest of the Euro Unsecured Notes, plus certain fees
and expenses of the Trustee, the Secured Notes Trustee and the Escrow Agent.

If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, upon initial issuance of the
Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer. Assuming the Escrow Release
Conditions (as defined below) have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Guarantors will become
parties to the Unsecured Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture to the Unsecured Indenture and the
obligations under the Unsecured Indenture will become obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Funds (as defined below),
is more fully described below under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event the
Acquisition Closing Date has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (as defined below) or upon the occurrence
of certain other events, each Series of Unsecured Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial
issue price of such Series of Unsecured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest (and accretion, if any) from the Issue
Date to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”).
See “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The net proceeds of this offering of the Unsecured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer,
Parent or its Subsidiaries, together with borrowings under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, the New ABL
Credit Agreement, proceeds from the Secured Notes and the Equity Investment, to (i) pay the cash portion of the
consideration pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement (as defined below), (ii) repay or redeem or satisfy in full
certain outstanding indebtedness of Solenis (as defined below) and Sigura (as defined below) and/or (iii) pay fees,
commissions and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined below), in each case, as described in this
offering memorandum under “Use of Proceeds.”

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Unsecured Indenture, the
Unsecured Notes and the Escrow Agreement. It does not restate the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes or
the Escrow Agreement in their entirety and is subject to, and qualified by reference to, all of the provisions of the
Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes and the Escrow Agreement. Copies of the Unsecured Indenture (and any
supplemental indentures) and the Escrow Agreement, if applicable, may be obtained from the Issuer upon request
after the Issue Date as set forth below under “—Additional Information.”

**Brief Description of the Unsecured Notes**

**_The Unsecured Notes_**

If the Acquisition is not consummated on the Issue Date, prior to the Escrow Release (as defined below),
the Unsecured Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer secured by the Escrowed Funds on a first
priority basis. From and after the Escrow Release (or on the Issue Date immediately following the Acquisition and
Reorganization if the Acquisition and Reorganization close concurrently with this offering), the Unsecured Notes
will be senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will:

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with all
existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including Indebtedness under the New Credit
Agreements and the Secured Notes);

    - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer, if
any;

177


-----

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured obligations of the Issuer (including
Indebtedness under the New Credit Agreements, the Secured Notes and capital leases, if any), to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations;

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of all Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and

    - from and after the Acquisition Closing Date, be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Parent and
each Wholly Owned Subsidiary that guarantees any obligations under the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement.

As described in this offering memorandum under “Use of Proceeds,” as of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total indebtedness of $4,007 million (including
finance lease obligations and excluding letters of credit), including the Unsecured Notes, the Secured Notes and
borrowings under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and the New ABL Credit Agreement, and we would have
had unused revolving commitments under our New ABL Credit Agreement available to us of $325 million (not
taking into account the impact of the ING RPA remaining outstanding). In addition, under the New Credit
Agreements, we have the option to raise incremental Indebtedness (including incremental term loans and
incremental revolving commitments, as applicable), subject to certain terms and conditions. See “Description of
New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

Certain of the operations of Parent will be conducted through its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer). As a
result, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from Parent’s Subsidiaries to generate the
funds necessary to meet its outstanding Indebtedness service and other obligations, and such dividends and other
payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing the Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Parent’s Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable the Issuer to make some or all of
the principal and interest payments on its Indebtedness, including the Unsecured Notes.

The Unsecured Indenture will not be qualified under the TIA, and the TIA shall not apply to or in any way
govern the terms of the Unsecured Indenture. As a result, no provisions of the TIA will be incorporated into the
Unsecured Indenture unless expressly incorporated pursuant to this “Description of Unsecured Notes.”

The registered holder of an Unsecured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered holders will have rights under the Unsecured Indenture.

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

The Issuer will issue $      million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Unsecured Notes and €
million aggregate principal amount of Euro Unsecured Notes in this offering. The Dollar Unsecured Notes and the
Euro Unsecured Notes will constitute separate Series of Unsecured Notes under the Unsecured Indenture but, except
as otherwise provided herein, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Unsecured Indenture,
including for purposes of voting and taking all other actions permitted by holders of the Unsecured Notes. For
purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes that have consented to or voted in favor
of any amendment, supplement or waiver, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Unsecured
Notes shall be calculated by the Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such
other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time)
on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such amendment, supplement or waiver. The Unsecured
Notes will mature on     , 2029.

Subject to compliance with the covenant described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,” the Issuer may issue additional
Dollar Unsecured Notes (“Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes”) and additional Euro Unsecured Notes (“Additional
_Euro Unsecured Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes, the “Additional Unsecured_
_Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Unsecured Indenture._

178


-----

Except as otherwise specified, the Dollar Unsecured Notes offered hereby and any Additional Dollar
Unsecured Notes subsequently issued under the Unsecured Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all
purposes under the Unsecured Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Except as otherwise specified, the Euro Unsecured Notes offered hereby and any Additional Euro Unsecured Notes
subsequently issued under the Unsecured Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Unsecured Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to “Dollar Unsecured Notes,” “Euro Unsecured Notes” and “Unsecured Notes” for all
purposes of the Unsecured Indenture and this “Description of Unsecured Notes” include any Additional Unsecured
Notes that are issued. However, in order for any Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes to have the same CUSIP
number as the Dollar Unsecured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes
must be fungible with the initial Dollar Unsecured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in order for any
Additional Euro Unsecured Notes to have the same CUSIP number as the Euro Unsecured Notes initially issued on
the Issue Date, such Additional Euro Unsecured Notes must be fungible with the initial Euro Unsecured Notes for
U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Interest on the Dollar Unsecured Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Euro
Unsecured Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Unsecured Notes will accrue from the
Issue Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually on
and      of each year (each such date, an “interest payment date”), commencing on     , 2022, to holders of
record as of the close of business on      or      (whether or not a business day) immediately preceding each
interest payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The
Dollar Unsecured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof and the Euro Unsecured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Unsecured Notes_**

All payments on (i) the Dollar Unsecured Notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent
maintained for such purpose (the “Dollar Paying Agent”) and (ii) the Euro Unsecured Notes will be made at the
office or agency of the paying agent maintained for such purpose (the “Euro Paying Agent” and, together with the
Dollar Paying Agent, the “paying agents”), in each case, unless the Issuer elects to make interest payments due on
an interest payment date by check mailed to the persons entitled thereto at their address set forth in the register of
holders; provided that if a holder of Unsecured Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the paying agent at least
fifteen (15) business days prior to an interest payment date, the Issuer will pay all interest on that holder’s
Unsecured Notes due on an interest payment date in accordance with those instructions. All payments on global
notes will be made in accordance with the applicable procedures of (i) The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), in
the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes and (ii) Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Euro Unsecured
Notes. Payments on the Unsecured Notes will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding for taxes,
except as otherwise required by law.

**_Paying Agents and Registrars for the Unsecured Notes_**

The initial Dollar Paying Agent and registrar for the Dollar Unsecured Notes will be The Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The initial Euro Paying Agent and registrar for the Euro Unsecured Notes will
be The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer may change the paying agent or registrar without
prior notice to the holders of the Unsecured Notes, and the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent
or registrar.

If any Unsecured Notes are listed on an exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will
satisfy any requirement of such exchange as to paying agents, registrars and transfer agents and will comply with
any notice requirements under such exchange in connection with any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer
agent.

179


-----

**_Transfer and Exchange_**

A holder may transfer or exchange Unsecured Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Unsecured
Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Unsecured Notes. Holders of the Unsecured
Notes will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any
Unsecured Note selected for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Unsecured Note being redeemed in
part. Also, the Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Unsecured Note for a period of fifteen (15)
days before a selection of Unsecured Notes to be redeemed.

**_Unsecured Note Guarantees_**

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Unsecured Notes will not be guaranteed. On the Acquisition
Closing Date, Parent and each of Parent’s Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries (other than
Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a borrower and/or guarantor under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement will jointly
and severally, irrevocably, fully and unconditionally guarantee on a senior unsecured basis the performance and
punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the
Issuer under the Unsecured Indenture and the Unsecured Notes (including interest, fees and expenses which, but for
the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to the Issuer, would have accrued on any Obligation, whether or
not a claim is allowed against the Issuer for such interest, fees and expenses in the related bankruptcy proceeding) to
the holders and the Trustee, whether for payment of principal or interest on the Unsecured Notes, fees, expenses,
indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein called the
“Unsecured Guaranteed Obligations”).

Each Unsecured Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a senior unsecured obligation of such Guarantor
and will:

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with all
existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including Indebtedness under the Secured
Notes and the New Credit Agreements);

    - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of
such Guarantor, if any;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of such Guarantor
(including such Guarantor’s guarantee of Indebtedness under the New Credit Agreements, Secured
Notes and capital leases, if any), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness;
and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of such Guarantor’s Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries.

Each Unsecured Note Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum
amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Unsecured Indenture or the
Unsecured Note Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—
Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a
court to void the Notes and/or the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured
Notes) and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” After the Acquisition Closing Date, the
Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is an Excluded Subsidiary or is already a
Guarantor) that is a guarantor or a borrower under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement to execute and deliver to
the Trustee a supplemental indenture, pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee performance and
payment of the Unsecured Notes on the same senior unsecured basis. See “—Certain Covenants—Future
Guarantees.”

180


-----

Each Unsecured Note Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding
paragraph, shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Unsecured Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the holders and their successors,
transferees and assigns.

An Unsecured Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon:

(a) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, Division or dissolution) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that
is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if
after such transaction the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or

(b) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, exchange,
disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, Division or
dissolution) is made in compliance with the Unsecured Indenture;

(c) the Issuer designating such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” and the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(d) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Acquisition Closing Date is
required to guarantee the Unsecured Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain
Covenants—Future Guarantees,” the release or discharge of the Guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or the repayment of the Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Unsecured Notes, except by
reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of such Indebtedness or if a release or discharge
is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other Guarantee
or direct obligation;

(e) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” or if the Issuer’s Obligations under the
Unsecured Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Unsecured
Indenture or through redemption or repurchase of all of the Unsecured Notes or otherwise) in accordance
with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture;

(f) the release or discharge of the Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Subsidiary
Guarantor of the Obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment
under or the termination or repayment of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or if such release or
discharge is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such
Guarantee or direct obligation;

(g) such Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary;

(h) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent, including
as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing Indebtedness or any exercise of
remedies in respect thereof; provided that such Subsidiary Guarantor shall only be released if such
Subsidiary became a non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary pursuant to a transaction where such Subsidiary
becomes a bona fide joint venture where the other Person taking an equity interest in such Subsidiary is not
an Affiliate of Parent (other than as a result of such joint venture);

181


-----

(i) as described in “—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Unsecured Notes
Rated Investment Grade”; or

(j) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

The Unsecured Note Guarantee of Parent will be released if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option
or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” if the Issuer’s
Obligations under the Unsecured Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the
Unsecured Indenture as described below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or through redemption or repurchase
of all the Unsecured Notes or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture or if there is a
release or discharge of such Unsecured Note Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, Parent of the Obligations under
the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of the
New Term Loan Credit Agreement or a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection with the
enforcement of remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation.

Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the Unsecured
Notes. The Unsecured Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade
creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Unsecured Indenture will
contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that Parent and certain of its Subsidiaries may incur,
such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. See “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” below.

As of the Acquisition Closing Date, all of Parent’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted
Subsidiaries.” However, under the circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants,” the Issuer will be
permitted to designate certain of Parent’s Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” The Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Unsecured Indenture and will not guarantee the Unsecured
Notes.

On the Acquisition Closing Date, each of Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a
borrower and/or guarantor under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement will be a Guarantor. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries
represented approximately 62% of our Net sales and approximately 62% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 74% of our total assets (excluding intercompany receivables and investments
in subsidiaries) and approximately 19% of our total liabilities (excluding intercompany payables).

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering is expected to be consummated on     , 2021, which may be prior to the consummation of
the Acquisition. If this offering does not close prior to consummation of the Acquisition, concurrently with the
closing of the offering of the Unsecured Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an Escrow Agreement
with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited): (i) an
amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Unsecured Notes into the Dollar Escrow
Account (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively, the “Dollar Escrowed Funds”);
and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Euro Unsecured Notes into the Euro
Escrow Account (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively, the “Euro Escrowed
_Funds” and, together with the Dollar Escrowed Funds, the “Escrowed Funds”). The Issuer will grant the Trustee, (i)_
for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, a first-priority security
interest in the Dollar Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations under the
Dollar Unsecured Notes and (ii) for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Euro Unsecured
Notes, a first-priority security interest in the Euro Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure
the Obligations under the Euro Unsecured Notes, in each case, pending disbursement as described below.

182


-----

Upon a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest
(and accretion, if any) owing to the holders of each Series of Unsecured Notes to, but not including, the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date, plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. Prior to the
Acquisition, the Issuer will have very limited assets other than the Escrowed Funds and the escrowed proceeds of
the offering of the Unsecured Notes and no operations. The Escrowed Funds will be limited to the gross proceeds
from this offering of the Unsecured Notes. As a result, an affiliate of Platinum will issue an irrevocable equity
commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) to the Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent
and the holders of the Unsecured Notes, that will require such affiliate of Platinum, (x) in the event that any interest
is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (as
defined below), to transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, or euros, in
the case of the Euro Unsecured Notes, to the Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to
the holders of such Unsecured Notes and (y) upon receipt of a notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption, to
transfer to the Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Unsecured
Notes, plus certain fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the
Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date
or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a
result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will release the
Escrowed Funds (the “Escrow Release”) to the Issuer (the date of such Escrow Release being referred to as the
“Acquisition Closing Date”) upon the presentation by the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee on or prior to July 11, 2022 (the “Outside Date”), certifying that (a) the Acquisition will be
consummated in accordance in all material respects with the Acquisition Agreement (without waiver or amendment
of, or consent under, the Acquisition Agreement that is, in the aggregate when taken as a whole, in the reasonable
opinion of the Issuer, materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Secured Notes; provided that, (1) no
reduction in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of
the Unsecured Notes, (2) no increase in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the
interests of the holders of the Unsecured Notes if such increase is not funded with additional Indebtedness, and (3)
no modification to the acquisition consideration as a result of any purchase price adjustment or working capital
adjustment expressly contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement as of the date hereof shall constitute a reduction
or increase in the acquisition consideration) and (b) the Guarantors will (i) become parties to the Indenture by means
of a supplemental indenture effective upon the date of the Escrow Release and (ii) will become parties to the
Purchase Agreement by means of a joinder agreement (the “Escrow Release Conditions”).

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in our good faith judgment, to be incapable of
being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, (any such event being a
“Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuer will redeem each Series of Unsecured Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) no later than three business days following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or otherwise in_
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable) (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date”) at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price._

As long as Dollar Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the
Escrow Agent at the Issuer’s written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written
instruction, the Dollar Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested
in cash. As long as Euro Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the Escrow
Agent at the Issuer’s written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written instruction, the
Euro Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested in cash.

“Eligible Escrow Investments” means any of the following securities: (1) investment in obligations issued
or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government, the U.K. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.K. government, any constituent nation
of the U.K. or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or any member of the European Union or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the Outside Date, (2) demand deposits, including

183


-----

interest bearing money market accounts, time deposits, trust funds, trust accounts, overnight bank deposits, interestbearing deposits, and certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of depository institutions in each case maturing
no later than the Outside Date, (3) investments in commercial paper maturing no later than the Outside Date and
having, at the date of acquisition, a credit rating no lower than A-1 from S&P, P-1 from Moody’s, or F-1 from Fitch,
(4) repurchase obligations maturing no later than the Outside Date entered into with a nationally recognized brokerdealer, with respect to which the purchased securities are obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government
or any agency thereof, which repurchase obligations shall be entered into pursuant to written agreements and (5)
investments in money market mutual funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted thereby from
S&P or Moody’s, including those for which the Trustee or an affiliate receives and retains a fee for services
provided to the fund, whether as a custodian, transfer agent, investment advisor or otherwise.

If the Escrow Agent (i) has not received an Officer’s Certificate at or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the Outside Date or (ii) has received an escrow termination notice from the Issuer prior to the Outside Date,
then the Escrow Agent promptly after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Outside Date or the date on which it
has received an escrow termination notice (as applicable) shall liquidate the Escrowed Funds and, on or prior to the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, release (x) an amount of Escrowed Funds to the Trustee equal to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price and (y) after payment of any amounts due and owing to the Trustee or the Escrow
Agent, any remaining amount of Escrowed Funds to the Issuer.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the
Escrowed Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Unsecured
Notes without the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes
outstanding. For purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes that have consented to
or voted in favor of any such waiver or modification, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro
Unsecured Notes shall be calculated by the Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters
screen (or such other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New
York City time) on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such waiver or modification. To the extent
such provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Unsecured Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption,
no provisions of the Unsecured Indenture may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the
holders of the Unsecured Notes without the written consent of all holders of the Unsecured Notes. By its acceptance
of an Unsecured Note, each holder shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the Trustee to enter into and
perform its obligations, if any, under the Escrow Agreement.

**Activities Prior to the Escrow Release**

The Issuer is a limited purpose entity. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer’s primary activities
will be restricted to issuing the Unsecured Notes and the Secured Notes, issuing capital stock to, and receiving
capital contributions from direct and indirect parent companies of the Issuer, performing its obligations in respect of
the Unsecured Notes under the Unsecured Indenture and the Escrow Agreement and performing its obligations in
respect of the Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes escrow agreement, performing any
obligations under the Acquisition Agreement, consummating the Escrow Release and redeeming the Unsecured
Notes and the Secured Notes, if applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary, advisable or
appropriate to carry out the activities described above or related to the Transactions. Prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date, the Issuer will not own, hold or otherwise have any interest in any assets other than the Escrow Accounts and
the escrow accounts holding the proceeds of the Secured Notes, cash and Cash Equivalents and its rights under the
Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which the Acquisition is to be consummated (if any), the Unsecured Notes and
the Unsecured Indenture and the Secured Notes and the Secured Indenture.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall not engage in any activity or enter into any
transaction or agreement (including, without limitation, making any restricted payment, incurring any debt (except
the Unsecured Notes and the Secured Notes), incurring any Liens except in favor of the Escrow Agent, Trustee, the
holders of the Unsecured Notes and/or the holders of the Secured Notes, entering into any merger, consolidation or
sale of all or substantially all of its assets or engaging in any transaction with its Affiliates) except in the ordinary
course of business or as necessary, advisable or appropriate to effectuate the Acquisition and the Transactions
substantially in accordance with the description of the Transactions set forth in this offering memorandum, together

184


-----

with such amendments, modifications and waivers that are not, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse
(after giving effect to the consummation of the Acquisition) to the holders of the Unsecured Notes.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) will
be parties to the Unsecured Indenture and will not be controlled by the Issuer; accordingly, prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) will be subject to the restrictions,
agreements or covenants in the Unsecured Indenture or the Escrow Agreement.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to (a) 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Unsecured Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any
Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes) issued under the Unsecured Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the
principal amount of Dollar Unsecured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Dollar
Unsecured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Dollar
Unsecured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the
redemption date), with the cash proceeds of any Equity Offering; provided that: (1) at least the lesser of (a) 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Unsecured Notes (including any Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes)
then outstanding or (b) $      million aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Unsecured Notes (including any
Additional Dollar Unsecured Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption
(except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture);
and (2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering; and (b) 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Unsecured Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any
Additional Euro Unsecured Notes) issued under the Unsecured Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the
principal amount of Euro Unsecured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Euro
Unsecured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Euro
Unsecured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the
redemption date), with the cash proceeds of any Equity Offering; provided that: (1) at least the lesser of (a) 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Unsecured Notes (including any Additional Euro Unsecured Notes) then
outstanding or (b) €      million aggregate principal amount of the Euro Unsecured Notes (including any
Additional Euro Unsecured Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption
(except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture);
and (2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of
either Series of Unsecured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable
Series of Unsecured Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of the redemption notice, and
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Unsecured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption,
subject to the rights of holders of the applicable Series of Unsecured Notes on a relevant record date to receive
interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date.

At any time, in connection with any offer to purchase either Series of Unsecured Notes (including pursuant
to a Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer (as defined below) or Asset Sale Offer (as defined below)), if holders
of at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of such Series of Unsecured Notes outstanding tender such Unsecured
Notes in such offer, the Issuer or such other Person, upon notice given not more than 60 days following such
purchase pursuant to such offer, may redeem all of the remaining Unsecured Notes of such Series at a price in cash
equal to the price offered to each holder in such prior offer, plus, to the extent not included in the prior offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Unsecured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of
redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Unsecured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on
an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date. In determining whether the holders of at least
90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Unsecured Notes of a Series have validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn Unsecured Notes in an offer, Unsecured Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds
controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for
the purposes of such offer.

185


-----

Except pursuant to the preceding paragraphs, the Unsecured Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s
option prior to     , 2024.

On or after     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of either
Series of Unsecured Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the applicable
Series of Unsecured Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Series
of Unsecured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12month period beginning on      of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Unsecured Notes
on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date:

**Year** **Dollar** **Euro Unsecured**
**Unsecured Notes** **Notes**

**Percentage** **Percentage**

2024 ............................................... % %
2025 ............................................... % %
2026 and thereafter ........................ % %

Any redemption of Unsecured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be performed by another Person and be
subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if any redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, the related notice of redemption shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date
may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be modified or rescinded in the event that any or
all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption
date, or by the redemption date so delayed (which may exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice in
such case). Such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been met by providing
notice to the noteholders.


Unsecured Notes called for redemption become due on the applicable redemption date (to the extent such
redemption date occurs and as such date may be extended or delayed). Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of
the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Unsecured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption
on the applicable redemption date (whether or not a business day).

The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Unsecured Notes. Any such
purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to
one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such
consideration as the Issuer or any such Affiliates may determine. The amount of such purchases may be material. To
the extent Unsecured Notes are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer, such Unsecured Notes may be
cancelled and all obligations thereunder terminated.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth under the heading “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer
will not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Unsecured Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Unsecured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Unsecured
Notes for redemption pro rata, by lot or by such method as it shall deem fair and appropriate. If the Unsecured Notes
are represented by global notes, interests in such global notes will be selected for redemption in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable; provided that (i) no Dollar Unsecured
Notes in denominations of $200,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part and (ii) no Euro Unsecured Notes
in denominations of €100,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part.

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or with respect to global notes, to the extent
permitted or required by the procedures or regulations of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, sent

186


-----

electronically) at least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Unsecured Notes
to be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent more than 60 days
prior to a redemption date if (a) the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Unsecured Notes or a
satisfaction and discharge of the Unsecured Indenture or (b) in the case of a redemption that is subject to one or
more conditions precedent, the date of redemption is extended as permitted in the Unsecured Indenture.

If any Unsecured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Unsecured Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Unsecured Note that is to be redeemed. A new
Unsecured Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Unsecured Note will be issued
in the name of the holder of Unsecured Notes upon cancellation of the original Unsecured Note (or transferred by
book entry).

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem a Series of Unsecured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not
less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of such Series of Unsecured Notes (which notice will
be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the rights of holders
of such Series of Unsecured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring
on or prior to the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if
any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if
the Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or other administrative
guidance promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations, or other official administrative guidance (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and
(2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of such Series of Unsecured
Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such Series of Unsecured Notes (but, in the
case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by another Guarantor who
can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts or by the Issuer), and such obligation
cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new paying agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly
announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date). The foregoing provisions shall
apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on such
Series of Unsecured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a
party to the Unsecured Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor
Person becomes a party to such Series of Unsecured Notes (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a later date, after such later date).

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be distributed in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the distribution of any notice of redemption of Unsecured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the
Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and
setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied
and that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable
measures available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified
under the laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be

187


-----

unreasonably withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as
a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate
and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the
Unsecured Notes or with respect to any Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction
of such Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If
any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Unsecured Note or Unsecured Notes
Guarantee thereof is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the paying agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is at any relevant time incorporated or organized, engaged
in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law or the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’s interpretation or administration
thereof to be made by any applicable withholding agent in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of the
Payor with respect to any Unsecured Note or any Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof, including (without limitation)
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by each beneficial owner in respect of such payments (i.e., the person treated as the owner of such
payments for purposes of the applicable Tax), after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding
or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by
such beneficial owner in respect of such payments on any such Unsecured Note or Unsecured Notes Guarantee
thereof in the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that (A) if a beneficial owner is not the
holder of the Notes, the Additional Amounts payable to such beneficial owner in respect of any Tax shall not exceed
the Additional Amounts that would have been payable to such beneficial owner in respect of such Tax had the
beneficial owner been the holder and (B) no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed, deducted or withheld but for
the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of
power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been resident for tax purposes,
or being or having been a citizen or domiciliary or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or having a place of management in, or
being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Unsecured Note
or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Unsecured Note,
the Unsecured Indenture or an Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by
the holder or the beneficial owner of the Unsecured Note to comply with a reasonable written
request of the Payor addressed to the holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least
30 days before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification,
information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the
holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other
certification, information or reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a

188


-----

law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a
precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax; provided that,
in each case, such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible for the Tax exemption or reduction
in question;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Unsecured
Note for payment (where Unsecured Notes are in definitive form and presentation is required)
more than 30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is
first made available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have
been entitled to Additional Amounts had the Unsecured Note been presented on the last day of
such 30 day period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding in respect of a payment
with respect to the Unsecured Notes or with respect to any Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code as
of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations thereunder or official
interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to current Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code (or any amended or successor version described above) and any intergovernmental
agreement, treaty or convention among governmental authorities (or related laws, rules or official
administrative guidance) implementing such Sections of the Code;

(7) (A) in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, any U.S. federal withholding Taxes and (B) in the
case of the Euro Unsecured Notes, any U.S. federal withholding Taxes, to the extent such Taxes
are imposed or withheld by reason of the holder (y) being a controlled foreign corporation within
the meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code related within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the
Code to the Issuer or a Guarantor, or (z) being an actual or constructive owner of 10 percent or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor
entitled to vote; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction
and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with applicable law.
In such event, the Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not
available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Trustee (with a copy to the paying agent). Such copies shall be made available to the holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the paying agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Unsecured
Note or any Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Unsecured Notes Trustee and the paying agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable
the paying agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Unsecured Notes Trustee and the paying agent shall
be entitled to rely solely, without further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes or this “Description of Unsecured Notes” there
is mentioned, in any context:

189


-----

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the
Unsecured Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Unsecured Notes or any Unsecured
Notes Guarantee thereof,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, additions to tax or penalties with
respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments in respect of any Unsecured
Notes, any Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof, the Unsecured Indenture, or any other document or instrument in
relation thereto (limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of
any payments of principal or interest on the Unsecured Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are
not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Unsecured
Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to any
Payor and to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for
tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or
with respect to the Unsecured Notes (or any Unsecured Notes Guarantee thereof) is made by or on behalf of such
Person, or, in each case, any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein.

**Issuance in euro; payment on the Euro Unsecured Notes**

Initial holders of the Euro Unsecured Notes will be required to pay for the Euro Unsecured Notes in euro,
and all payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest, will be payable in euro; provided, that if on or after
the Issue Date, (i) the euro is unavailable to the Issuer due to the imposition of exchange controls or other
circumstances beyond its control or (ii) the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European
Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public
institutions of or within the international banking community (clauses (i) and (ii), each a “Euro Unavailability
_Event”), then all payments in respect of the Euro Unsecured Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the end of such_
Euro Unavailability Event. The amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate
mandated by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the
relevant payment date or, in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the
basis of the most recent U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal (or, if not published by
the Wall Street Journal, other national news source) on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant
payment date. Any payment in respect of the Euro Unsecured Notes so made in U.S. dollars during the continuance
of a Euro Unavailability Event will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Euro Unsecured Notes or
the Unsecured Indenture. In no event shall the Trustee or paying agents be responsible for monitoring any exchange
rates or effecting any conversions.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence after the Acquisition Closing Date of a Change of Control, each holder of Unsecured
Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any portion (equal to a minimum denomination of

190


-----

$200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, or equal to a
minimum denomination of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro
Unsecured Notes) of that holder’s Unsecured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in
the Unsecured Indenture; provided that any unpurchased portion of an Unsecured Note must be in a minimum
denomination of (i) $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes and (ii) €100,000 in the case of the Euro
Unsecured Notes. In the Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment (the “Change of Control
_Payment”) in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes repurchased, plus accrued_
and unpaid interest, if any, on the Unsecured Notes repurchased to (but not including) the date of purchase (the
“Change of Control Payment Date”), subject to the rights of holders of Unsecured Notes on a relevant record date to
receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Prior
to or within 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent the Issuer has delivered notice to the
Trustee of its intention to redeem Unsecured Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer
will mail (or with respect to global notes to the extent permitted or required by the procedures or regulations of DTC
or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, send electronically) a notice to each holder (a “Change of Control
_Offer”), with a copy to the Trustee, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to_
constitute, the Change of Control and offering to repurchase Unsecured Notes on the Change of Control Payment
Date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than ten days and no later than 90 days (unless delivered in
advance of the occurrence of such Change of Control) from the date such notice is mailed or sent, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Unsecured Indenture and described in such notice. If such notice is delivered prior to the
occurrence of a Change of Control, such notice shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned upon the
occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the
Issuer’s sole discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than
90 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions
shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all
such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control
Payment Date as so delayed. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in
connection with the repurchase of the Unsecured Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Unsecured
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Unsecured Indenture by virtue of such
compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Unsecured Notes or portions of Unsecured Notes properly tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Unsecured Notes or portions of Unsecured Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Unsecured Notes properly accepted together
with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes or
portions of Unsecured Notes being purchased by the Issuer.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Unsecured Notes properly tendered the Change of
Control Payment for such Unsecured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Unsecured Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as
soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Unsecured Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the holders of the Unsecured Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the
Unsecured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

191


-----

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Unsecured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Unsecured Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) in
connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) or a third
party has made an offer to purchase at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Unsecured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Unsecured Notes
validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all
Unsecured Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer, or (3) notice of redemption
has been given to the Trustee pursuant to the Unsecured Indenture as described above under “—Optional
Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of
a Change of Control and/or conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Unsecured Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its
Unsecured Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of
control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of
our assets.”

The occurrence of a Change of Control under the Unsecured Indenture may also constitute a default under
the New Credit Agreements that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. As a result,
following a Change of Control, the Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Unsecured Notes unless all
indebtedness outstanding under the New Credit Agreements is first repaid and any other Indebtedness that contains
similar provisions is repaid, or we obtain a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness to provide the Issuer with
sufficient cash to repurchase the Unsecured Notes. In addition, the Secured Notes will have similar requirements
regarding the Issuer’s obligation to offer to purchase such Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase
the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with
the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Unsecured
Notes) prior to the occurrence of such Change of Control.

**_Asset Sales_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) Parent (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time
of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, in the case of any single transaction that involves
assets having a fair market value of more than the greater of (x) $45.0 million and (y) 7.5% of Consolidated
EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in
the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet or in the footnotes thereto for which internal financial statements are available) of Parent or such Restricted

192


-----

Subsidiary (or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have
been reflected on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet (or in the footnotes thereto) (other than
liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Unsecured Notes or any Unsecured Note Guarantee)) that are
assumed by the transferee with respect to the applicable disposition and for which Parent and the Restricted
Subsidiaries shall have been validly released by all applicable creditors in writing,

(b) any securities, notes, other obligations or assets received by Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are convertible by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the applicable Asset Sale;

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash
Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x)
$180.0 million and (y) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary that is
not Subordinated Indebtedness received from such transferee; and

(e) accounts receivable of a business retained by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, following the sale of such business; provided that such accounts receivable (1) are not past due more
than 90 days and (2) do not have a payment date greater than 120 days from the date of the invoices creating such
accounts receivable.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds at its option:

(1) (i) to repay Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including Obligations under the
New ABL Credit Agreement, the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Secured Notes) and, if the Secured
Indebtedness being repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect
thereto or (ii) to repay any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is not a Guarantor (other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary of Parent);

(2) to repay (i) (x) the Unsecured Notes or (y) unsecured Indebtedness or other unsecured obligations
of the Issuer, in each case, that rank pari passu with the Unsecured Notes or (ii) unsecured Indebtedness and other
unsecured obligations of a Guarantor that rank pari passu with such Guarantor’s Unsecured Note Guarantee (other
than Indebtedness owed to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided that if Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) shall so reduce Indebtedness other than the Unsecured Notes, the Issuer shall equally and
ratably redeem or repurchase the Unsecured Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” through
open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or by
making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to
purchase the Unsecured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on
the Unsecured Notes repurchased, to (but not including) the date of repayment;

(3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, a Permitted Business, if,
after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent or additional Capital Stock of an existing non-Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) to make a capital expenditure;

(5) to make an investment in any one or more businesses or property, plant or equipment or acquire
property, plant or equipment, in each case that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; provided that such
investment is made in accordance with the provisions of the Unsecured Indenture; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing.

Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions set forth in clause (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the preceding paragraph if, (i) within 450 days after the Asset
Sale that generated the Net Proceeds, Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) has entered into and not

193


-----

abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment or payment in compliance with the provisions
described in the immediately preceding paragraph, and that investment or payment is thereafter completed within
180 days after the end of such 450-day period or (ii) in the event such binding agreement described in the preceding
clause (i) is cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) enters into another such binding commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or
termination of the prior binding commitment; provided that if any second binding commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied within 180 days of such second binding
commitment, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a distribution of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset
Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary to Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary of Parent (i) is (x) prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law, rule or regulation, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or
(z) subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States or
(ii) would have a material adverse tax consequence, as reasonably determined by the Issuer, an amount equal to the
portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant;
_provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which such amount would otherwise have been_
required to be applied pursuant to this covenant, distribution of any of such affected Net Proceeds is no longer
prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, rule or regulation, restricted by any applicable organizational
document or agreement, subject to other organizational or administrative impediment from being repatriated to the
United States, and would not result in a material adverse tax consequences, then an amount equal to such amount of
Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would
be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated, whether or not they are repatriated) in
compliance with this covenant. To the extent that the Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale are attributable to a non-Wholly
Owned Subsidiary, the amount of such Net Proceeds required to be applied in compliance with this covenant shall
not exceed the lesser of (x) an amount corresponding to the proportionate ownership interests in such non-Wholly
Owned Subsidiary or (y) an amount corresponding to the amount of distributions permitted to be made from such
non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary to its direct or indirect parent entity that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary for such
purposes at the time such prepayment is required to be made. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a
consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of
Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Unsecured Indenture shall be construed to require Parent or any
Foreign Subsidiary to repatriate cash or to apply any Net Proceeds described in clause (i) above in compliance with
this covenant in the event that such repatriation is not permitted under applicable local law, rule or regulation,
applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediment within one year following the date on
which the respective payment would otherwise have been required.

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Proceeds, Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net
Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Unsecured Indenture. Any Net Proceeds that are not applied or
invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any such
proceeds not required to be applied or invested as a result of the fourth paragraph of this covenant) will constitute
“Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of proceeds offered to holders in accordance with clause (2) of the
second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) made at any time after the
Asset Sale shall be deemed to have been applied as required and shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without
regard to the extent to which such offer is accepted by the holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds
exceeds the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, within 30 days thereof, the Issuer
will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Unsecured Notes and Indebtedness of the Issuer or a
Guarantor that rank pari passu with the Unsecured Notes (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or a Restricted
Subsidiary) that, in each case, contains provisions similar to those set forth in the Unsecured Indenture with respect
to offers to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, to purchase, prepay or redeem on a pro
rata basis the maximum principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Unsecured Notes and such other pari
_passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including_
premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of such Excess
Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer, in the case of the Unsecured Notes, will be equal to 100% of the
principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Unsecured Notes repurchased, to (but not
including) the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Unsecured Notes on a
relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date,

194


-----

and will be payable in cash. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such Excess Proceeds
from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds at any time prior to the
expiration of the application period or by electing to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds.

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer (any such amount, “Retained
_Declined Proceeds”), the Issuer may use those Retained Declined Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited_
by the Unsecured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes and other pari passu
Indebtedness tendered in (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds
the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer will select the Unsecured Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness to
be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed and thereafter
the Trustee will select the Unsecured Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of DTC or
of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with respect to the global notes) based on the principal amount tendered
(with, in each case, such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Issuer so that only Unsecured Notes in
minimum denominations of (i) in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, $200,000, or an integral multiple of
$1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of the Euro Unsecured Notes, €100,000, or an integral multiple of
€1,000 in excess thereof, in each case, will be purchased; provided that any unpurchased portion of an Unsecured
Note must be in a minimum denomination of (i) in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, $200,000 or (ii) in the
case of the Euro Unsecured Notes, €100,000). Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess
Proceeds will be reset at zero.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
each repurchase of Unsecured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Unsecured Indenture, the Issuer will
comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations
under the Asset Sale provisions of the Unsecured Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the New Credit Agreements and the Secured
Indenture, contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would
constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. The exercise by the holders of Unsecured Notes and holders of
Secured Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Unsecured Notes and Secured Notes,
respectively, upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if
the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not cause a default, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on
us. In the event a Change of Control or Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing
Unsecured Notes or Secured Notes, we could seek the consent of lenders under the New Credit Agreements or such
other Indebtedness to the purchase of Unsecured Notes or Secured Notes or could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will
remain prohibited from purchasing Unsecured Notes or Secured Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase
tendered Unsecured Notes and Secured Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Unsecured Indenture
and the Secured Indenture, respectively, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the New Credit Agreements
and such other Indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of Unsecured Notes and the
holders of Secured Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes
upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

Because the Obligations under the New Credit Agreements and the Secured Indenture are secured by
substantially all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ properties and assets, and since the definition of “Net Proceeds”
excludes all amounts in respect of any Asset Sale that are used to repay any Indebtedness that is secured by property
or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, it is unlikely that any meaningful amount of Net Proceeds will be
generated from any Asset Sale so long as the New Credit Agreements and Secured Notes remain outstanding.

The Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with the
written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Unsecured Notes) prior to
the date by which the Issuer is required to make such Asset Sale Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Changes in Covenants When Unsecured Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Acquisition Closing Date:

(1) a Series of Unsecured Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both of the Ratings Agencies;
and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter and subject to the provisions of the second
succeeding paragraph, (i) the Unsecured Note Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged and (ii) the covenants specifically listed under the following sections in this offering memorandum
(collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”) will be suspended with respect to such Series of Unsecured Notes:

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”; and

(8) clause (4) of the covenant described below under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Board of Directors of the Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may not designate any of Parent’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries” unless the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer
would have been able, under the terms of the Unsecured Indenture, to designate such Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries if the Suspended Covenants were not suspended. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may
be reinstated, the failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (as defined below)
(including any action taken or omitted to be taken with respect thereto and including any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligations arising during the Suspension Period) will not give rise to a Default or Event
of Default under the Unsecured Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Series of Unsecured Notes no longer have an Investment
Grade Rating from both of the Ratings Agencies, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date
of such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”). The period of time between the suspension of covenants
as set forth above and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” All Indebtedness incurred
(including Acquired Debt) and Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued during the Suspension Period will be
deemed to have been incurred or issued in reliance on the exception provided by clause (2) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt.” Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant will be made as if the
“Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect prior to, but not during, the period that the “Restricted Payments”
covenant was suspended as set forth above. For purposes of determining compliance with the covenant described
above under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the Excess Proceeds from all Asset Sales not
applied in accordance with such covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero after the Reversion Date. In addition,
for purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements

196


-----

entered into by Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of Parent during the Suspension Period prior
to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (12) of the second paragraph of “—
Transactions with Affiliates,” and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such
Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been
entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant
described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” or any
provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and during the
Suspension Period.

Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Unsecured Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Future Guarantees” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on
which any guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of the covenant described under “—Future
Guarantees”).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be
deemed to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension
Period and Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or
breach of any of the Suspended Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Unsecured
Indenture with respect to the applicable Series of Unsecured Notes, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any
contractual commitments or obligations following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby; provided that such contractual commitments or obligations were entered into during the
Suspension Period and not in contemplation of a reversion of the Suspended Covenants; provided, further, that, to
the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the making of a Restricted Payment, such Restricted
Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first paragraph or under the second paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Restricted Payments” and, if not permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment
shall be deemed permitted under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted
Payments” and shall be deducted for purposes of calculating the amount pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not
be less than zero).

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Suspension
Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor the ratings of the Unsecured Notes,
independently determine or verify if such events have occurred or notify the holders of Unsecured Notes of any
Suspension Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee may provide a copy of such Officer’s Certificate to any holder of
Unsecured Notes upon written request.

There can be no assurance that either Series of Unsecured Notes will ever achieve an Investment Grade
Rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_Restricted Payments_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of Parent’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with
any merger or consolidation involving Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) (other than dividends or
distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent and other than dividends or
distributions payable to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries);

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving Parent) any Equity Interests of Parent or any direct or

EBITDA that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes or to any Unsecured Note
Guarantee, except any such payment on Indebtedness permitted under clause (6) or (7) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt” and a payment of interest when due or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or the purchase,
redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement for value of any such Indebtedness within 365 days of
the Stated Maturity thereof; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(a) solely in the case of clause (2) below, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;

(b) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
Restricted Payment has been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, the Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio for Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been less than or equal to 6.25 to 1.00; and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Acquisition Closing Date (including Restricted
Payments permitted by clause (3) of the next succeeding paragraph and excluding Restricted Payments permitted by
all other clauses of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(1) the greater of (x) $300.0 million and (y) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(2) an amount (which may not be less than zero) equal to 50% of the Consolidated
Net Income of Parent for the period (taken as one accounting period) from July 1, 2021 to the end
of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements of Parent are
available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such
period is a deficit, less 0% of such deficit); plus

(3) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and Fair Market Value of
property other than cash (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph),
received by Parent after the Acquisition Closing Date as a contribution to its common equity
capital or from the issue or sale of Qualifying Equity Interests of Parent or any direct or indirect
parent of Parent (excluding, without duplication, Designated Preferred Stock, the Cash
Contribution Amount and Excluded Contributions), or from the issue or sale of Disqualified Stock
of Parent or debt securities of Parent, in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for
Qualifying Equity Interests of Parent (other than Qualifying Equity Interests and convertible or
exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of Parent); plus

(4) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of property
other than cash (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph) received by
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from (A) the sale or disposition (other than to Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Restricted Investments made after the Acquisition Closing
Date and from repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries by any Person (other than Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and from
repayments of loans or advances that constituted Restricted Investments made after the
Acquisition Closing Date; (B) the sale (other than to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) of the
Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (C) a distribution or dividend from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, to the extent that such amounts were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net
Income of Parent for such period; (D) any Restricted Investment that was made after the
Acquisition Closing Date in a Person that is not a subsidiary at such time that subsequently
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent; and (E) any returns, profits, distributions and similar

198


-----

amounts received on account of any Permitted Investment made after the Acquisition Closing
Date subject to a dollar-denominated or ratio-based basket (to the extent in excess of the original
amount of such Investment) and without duplication of any returns, profits, distributions or similar
amounts included in the calculation of such basket; plus

(5) in the event that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Parent designated as such after
the Acquisition Closing Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or has been merged or
consolidated with or into or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is liquidated into, Parent or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after the Acquisition Closing Date, an amount (which may
not be less than zero) equal to 100% of the Fair Market Value of Parent’s Restricted Investment in
such Subsidiary (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph) as of the
date of such redesignation, combination or transfer (or of the assets transferred or conveyed, as
applicable), after deducting any Indebtedness associated with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so
designated or combined or any Indebtedness associated with the assets so transferred or conveyed
(other than in each case to the extent that the designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary constituted a Permitted Investment); plus

(6) the aggregate amount of Retained Declined Proceeds since the Acquisition
Closing Date.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any
similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent to the holders of its Equity Interests so long as Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of
the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of Parent) of, Equity Interests of Parent (other than

preceding paragraph;

(3) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 90 days after the date
of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or

(4) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness
of Parent, the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the
Unsecured Notes or to any Unsecured Note Guarantee with the net cash proceeds of Refinancing Indebtedness;

(5) the repurchase, retirement or other acquisition (or the declaration and payment of dividends to, or

acquisition) for value of Equity Interests of Parent, any direct or indirect parent of Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent held by any future, present or former employee, officer, director, manager, consultant or

aggregate amount of permitted Investments in minority interests in Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Wholly
Owned Subsidiaries by Parent, shall not exceed the greater of (x) $30.0 million and (y) 5.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA;

(23) any payment in the minimum amount necessary to prevent any Indebtedness of Parent, the Issuer
or any Subsidiary Guarantor from being treated as an “applicable high yield discount obligation” within the meaning
of Section 163(i)(1) of the Code; and

(24) following the Escrow Release, the payment of a dividend or other distribution the proceeds of
which are used to consummate the Acquisition, including in order to satisfy deferred purchase price, earn-outs and
contingent payments in respect of any amounts due and owing as provided in the Acquisition Agreement, in an
amount equal to the sum of (x) the excess of the Escrowed Funds immediately prior to the Escrow Release over an
amount equal to the gross cash proceeds from the offering of the Unsecured Notes issued on the Issue Date and (y)
the excess of the funds contained in the escrow account holding the gross proceeds of the Secured Notes (together
with any earnings thereon and investments thereof) immediately prior to the Escrow Release over an amount equal
to the gross cash proceeds from the offering of the Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date;

_provided, however, that at the time of, and after giving effect to, any Restricted Payment permitted under clauses (5),_
(12), (16) and (21), no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence
thereof.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) will be the Fair Market Value on the date of the
Restricted Payment of the asset(s) or securities proposed to be transferred or issued by Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, pursuant to the Restricted Payment.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Restricted Payments” covenant, in the event that a
Restricted Payment or Investment meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Restricted Payments
described in clauses (1) through (24) above or clauses (1) through (32) of the definition of “Permitted Investment”
or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer will be entitled to classify such
Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or date of determination or later
reclassify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this
covenant or the definition of “Permitted Investment” and/or one or more of the exceptions contained in the
definition of “Permitted Investment” as of the date of such reclassification. If Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment that, at the time of the making of such Restricted Payment, in the good
faith determination of the Issuer, would be permitted under the requirements of the Unsecured Indenture, such
Restricted Payment shall be deemed to have been made in compliance with the Unsecured Indenture
notwithstanding any subsequent adjustment made in good faith to Parent’s financial statements affecting
Consolidated Net Income.

**_Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur,
issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to
(collectively, “incur”) any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), and Parent will not issue any Disqualified Stock
and will not permit (a) any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to issue any shares of Disqualified Stock or (b) any NonGuarantor Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that Parent and any Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) or issue Disqualified Stock, and any NonGuarantor Subsidiary of Parent may issue shares of preferred stock, if either (1) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio
for Parent’s most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available
immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock or
such preferred stock is issued or the date of determination, as the case may be, would have been at least (x) 2.00 to
1.00 or (y) at the election of the Issuer if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is incurred in
connection with a Permitted Investment, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio in effect immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction or (2) the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio for Parent and its Restricted

202


-----

Subsidiaries, calculated as of the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred or such Disqualified Stock
or preferred stock is issued or the date of determination, as the case may be, would have been less than or equal to
either (x) 6.25 to 1.00 or (y) at the election of the Issuer if such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock is incurred in connection with a Permitted Investment, the Consolidated Total Debt Ratio in effect
immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction (such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred
stock incurred or issued pursuant to subclause (1) or (2), “Ratio Debt”); provided that the aggregate principal
amount of Indebtedness that may be incurred as Ratio Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors shall
not exceed the greater of (x) $300.0 million and (y) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA at any one time outstanding.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(1) the incurrence by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or the

Closing Date will be deemed to have been incurred in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1)(a) of the
definition of “Permitted Debt” and may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in
accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of
additional shares of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or
an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant or the covenant set forth under “—
Liens”; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof shall be included in Fixed Charges of Parent as accrued.
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar- denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of
Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign
currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving or delayed
draw Indebtedness, or first issued, in the case of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or, in each case, at the option
of the borrower or issuer of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the date on which the rate of
interest and other pricing terms of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock are determined or the
date of determination; provided, that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is Indebtedness
incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued to Refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency (or in a different currency from such Indebtedness so being
incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being issued), and such refinancing would cause the applicable
clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” (or categories of Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” (or categories of
Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness or liquidation preference of
such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed (i) the outstanding or, in the case of revolving
Indebtedness, committed, principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock being Refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of Additional Refinancing Amounts
incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of
Parent may incur or issue pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness, delayed
draw facility or other committed debt financing incurred under such ratio-based basket, Parent may elect (which
election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), at any time, to either (x) give pro forma effect to
the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness, in which case such committed amount may
thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, without further compliance with any
ratio-based component of any provision of the Unsecured Indenture, or (y) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of
the actual amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw facility or other committed debt
financing, in which case, the ability to incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness will be subject to
such ratio-based basket (to the extent being incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each such incurrence. For
purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference, as
applicable, of any particular Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued pursuant to and in
compliance with, this covenant, if any commitments in respect of revolving or deferred draw Indebtedness are
established in reliance on any clause of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA, at the Issuer’s option, on the date of the initial borrowing of such Indebtedness or entry into
the definitive agreement providing the commitment to fund such Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the
incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness (such committed amount, a “Grower Tested
_Committed Amount”) may thereafter be borrowed and reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time,_
irrespective of whether or not such incurrence would cause such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be
exceeded and such Grower Tested Committed Amount shall be deemed outstanding pursuant to such basket so long
as such commitments are in effect. If any Indebtedness is incurred or any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is
issued to Refinance Indebtedness (or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness) initially incurred (or
established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued (or to Refinance Indebtedness incurred (or commitments
established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued) to Refinance Indebtedness initially incurred (or

-----

commitments initially established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock initially issued in reliance on any clause
or clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or
a ratio-based basket at the time of incurrence or issuance, and such refinancing would cause such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded or ratio to be unmet if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or ratio shall not be deemed to be exceeded or unmet (and such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock shall be deemed permitted) so long as the principal amount or the liquidation
preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the
principal amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being
Refinanced, plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding anything in the Unsecured Indenture to the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, if,
on any date, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related
transactions (A) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock as permitted by a ratio-based or
ratio-referent clause or provision and (B) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under a
non-ratio-based or non-ratio-referent clause or provision, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such date
with respect to any incurrence under the applicable ratio-based or ratio referent clause or provision without giving
effect to the incurrence under such non-ratio-based or non-ratio-referent clause or provision made in connection with
such transaction or series of related transactions.

If Indebtedness originally incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock originally issued in reliance
upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Ratio Incremental Amount under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time,
then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1)
so long as the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with
such refinancing.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Liens_**

Parent will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind (other than Permitted Liens), securing Indebtedness of
Parent, the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, on any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired or
any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, unless in each case:

(1) in the case of Liens securing Subordinated Indebtedness, the Unsecured Notes are secured by a
Lien on such property, assets or proceeds that is senior in priority to such Liens; or

(2) in all other cases, the Unsecured Notes are equally and ratably secured.

210


-----

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Unsecured Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be
deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release of the Lien that gave rise to
the obligation to secure the Unsecured Notes, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any Unsecured Note
Guarantee, the termination and discharge of such Unsecured Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the
Unsecured Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of Parent that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under “—
Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”) to any Person not an Affiliate of Parent of the property or assets secured
by such Lien, or of all of the Capital Stock held by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or
substantially all the assets of, any Restricted Subsidiary creating such Lien.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described in the definition of
“Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any
combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets
the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later
divide, classify or reclassify, such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner
that complies with this covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien or such item
of Indebtedness secured by such Lien in one of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and such Lien
securing such item of Indebtedness will be treated as being incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such clauses
or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the incurrence thereof, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.

**_Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors
to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor to:

(1) pay dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to Parent or any of its

-----

materially more restrictive than those contained in agreements governing Indebtedness in effect on the Acquisition
Closing Date, or (ii) are not materially more disadvantageous to holders of the Unsecured Notes than is customary in
comparable financings (as determined by the Issuer in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive) and in
the case of subclause (ii) either (x) the Issuer determines (in good faith) that such encumbrance or restriction will not
affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Unsecured Notes or (y) such encumbrances
or restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in respect of payment or a financial maintenance
covenant relating to such Indebtedness;

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction;

in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or

Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture that restricts distributions by that Restricted
Subsidiary pending such sale or other disposition;

(9) Refinancing Indebtedness; provided that the restrictions contained in the agreements governing
such Refinancing Indebtedness are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those contained in the
agreements governing the Indebtedness being refinanced;

(10) Secured Indebtedness otherwise permitted to be incurred pursuant to the covenant described under
“—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” and Liens permitted to be

subject to such Liens;

(11) provisions limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property in joint venture agreements,

(17) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to an Unrestricted Subsidiary pursuant to or by reason
of an agreement that the Unrestricted Subsidiary is a party to or entered into before the date on which such
Unrestricted Subsidiary became a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent; provided that such agreement was not entered
into in anticipation of the Unrestricted Subsidiary becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent and any such
encumbrance or restriction does not extend to any assets or property of Parent or of any Restricted Subsidiary other
than the assets and property of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(18) provisions with respect to the receipt of a rebate on an operating lease until all obligations due to a
lessor on other operating leases are satisfied or other customary restrictions in respect of assets or contract rights
acquired by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent in connection with a Sale/Leaseback Transaction;

(19) encumbrances and restrictions contained in contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business, not relating to any Indebtedness, and that do not, individually or in the aggregate, detract from the value of

Subsidiary to realize such value, or to make any distributions relating to such property or assets in each case in any
material respect; and

(20) any encumbrances or restrictions of the type referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the
immediately preceding paragraph imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in
clauses (1) through (19) above; provided that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer, not materially
more restrictive as a whole with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the
dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase,
supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (i) the priority of any preferred stock in
receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common
shares shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the
subordination of loans or advances made to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to other Indebtedness
incurred by Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or
advances.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

Parent and the Issuer will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person,
(2) consummate a Division as the Dividing Person (whether or not Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, is the
surviving entity) or (3) sell, assign, transfer, convey, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
properties or assets of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one or more related transactions, to
another Person (other than in connection with the Transactions), unless:

(1) either: (a) Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, is the surviving Person; or (b) the Person formed by
or surviving any such consolidation, merger or Division (if other than Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) or to which

any state of the United States or the District of Columbia and (ii) in the case of the Issuer, the laws of the United
States, any state of the United States or the District of Columbia (such Person, the “Surviving Entity”);

213


-----

(2) the Surviving Entity (if other than Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) or the Person to which such
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition has been made (a) in the case of Parent, provides
an Unsecured Note Guarantee on the same terms and conditions as those set forth in the Unsecured Indenture and
applicable to the Guarantors and (b) in the case of the Issuer, assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the
Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Indenture, pursuant to a supplemental indenture;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity would, after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related
financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, (a) be
permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness as Ratio Debt, (b) have had a Fixed Charge Coverage
Ratio equal to or greater than the actual Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for Parent for such four-quarter period or (c)
have had a Consolidated Total Debt Ratio equal to or less than such ratio for Parent for such four- quarter period;
and

(5) the Surviving Entity (if other than Parent or the Issuer, as applicable) shall deliver, or cause to be
delivered, to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each to the effect that such
consolidation, merger, Division, sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer, lease or other disposition complies with the
requirements of the Unsecured Indenture.

This “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant will not apply to any sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance, lease, Division or other disposition of assets between or among Parent, the Issuer and any Guarantor.
Clauses (3) and (4) of the first paragraph of this covenant will not apply to (a) any merger, consolidation or
amalgamation of any Restricted Subsidiary with or into Parent or the Issuer, (b) any consolidation, amalgamation or
merger of Parent or the Issuer into, or sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or part
of the properties and assets of Parent or the Issuer to, the Issuer or any Guarantor, (c) a merger, consolidation or
amalgamation of Parent or the Issuer with or into an Affiliate for the purpose of reincorporating Parent or the Issuer
in another jurisdiction so long as the amount of Indebtedness of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries is not
increased thereby or (d) the conversion of Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries into a corporation, partnership,
limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof, the District of Columbia or, in the case of Parent, the Cayman Islands. In addition, Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary may change its name.

All references to “Parent” or “Issuer,” as applicable, in this “Description of Unsecured Notes” shall be
deemed to include any successor entity that assumes all of the obligations of Parent or the Issuer, as applicable,
under the Unsecured Notes in a transaction that complies with this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”
covenant. Following any such assumption (except in the case of a lease), Parent, the Issuer or such predecessor
company, as the case may be, shall be released from its obligations under the Unsecured Indenture and the
Unsecured Notes.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter
into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for
the benefit of, any Affiliate of Parent involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of (x)
$45.0 million and (y) 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person (as determined in good faith by the senior
management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer); and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $120.0 million and (y) 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the

214


-----

terms of the Affiliate Transaction have been approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or
indirect parent of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable.

The following items will not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to
the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any reasonable or customary employment agreement, consulting agreement, severance agreement,
employee benefit plan, compensation arrangement, officer or director indemnification agreement or any similar
arrangement entered into by, or policy of, Parent, any direct or indirect parent of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
of Parent and payments pursuant thereto;

(2) (a) transactions between or among Parent and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries, (b) transactions
effected as part of a Qualified Securitization Transaction and (c) any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of
Parent and any direct or indirect parent of Parent; provided that such parent entity shall have no material liabilities
and no material assets (other than cash, Cash Equivalents and the Capital Stock of Parent) and such merger,
amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture and effected
for a bona fide business purpose;

(3) transactions with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary of Parent) that is an Affiliate of
Parent solely because Parent owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls,
such Person;

otherwise) of officers, directors, employees, independent contractors or consultants of Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any direct or indirect parent of Parent;

(5) any sale, issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent or any

days of the Acquisition Closing Date, and the payment of fees and expenses not in excess of the amounts specified
in, or determined pursuant to, such agreements, as in effect within 30 days of the Acquisition Closing Date;
_provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries of their_
respective obligations under, any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement
entered into after the Acquisition Closing Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms
of any such existing agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new agreement are not
otherwise more disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of
the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) to the holders of the Unsecured Notes in any material respect
than the original agreement as in effect within 30 days of the Acquisition Closing Date;

(8) if such Affiliate Transaction is with a Person in its capacity as a holder of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock, preferred stock or Capital Stock of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent where such
Person is treated no more favorably than the other holders of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, preferred stock or
Capital Stock of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent;

(9) transactions with an Affiliate where the only consideration paid is Qualifying Equity Interests of
Parent;

paragraph;

as any such agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous in any
material respect (as determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or
any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) to the holders of the Unsecured Notes in any material respect than the
original agreement as in effect on the Acquisition Closing Date) or any transaction contemplated thereby;

covenant described above under “—Restricted Payments”;

(18) transactions with Unrestricted Subsidiaries, customers, clients, lessors, landlords, suppliers,

Restricted Subsidiaries, or made in the reasonable determination of senior management or the Board of Directors of
the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer;

(19) transactions between Parent and any Person that is an Affiliate solely due to the fact that a director
of such Person is also a director of Parent or any direct or indirect parent of Parent; provided, however, that such
director abstains from voting as a director of Parent or such direct or indirect parent, as the case may be, on any
matter involving such other Person;

(20) payments by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to or on behalf of the Principals for any

Parent to fund payment of any such fees or expenses); and

(24) transactions undertaken in good faith (as certified by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of Parent in an Officers’ Certificate) for the purpose of improving the consolidated tax efficiency of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in the Unsecured Indenture.

**_Future Guarantees_**

If, after the Acquisition Closing Date, (a) any Subsidiary of Parent (including any newly formed, newly
acquired or newly redesignated Restricted Subsidiary, but excluding any Securitization Entity and any Excluded
Subsidiary) that is not then a Guarantor guarantees or incurs any Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement or (b) Parent otherwise elects to have any Restricted Subsidiary become a Guarantor, then, in each such
case, Parent shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture to
the Unsecured Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the
Unsecured Indenture providing for an Unsecured Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms
and conditions as those set forth in the Unsecured Indenture and applicable to the other Guarantors; provided that, in
the case of clause (a), such supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered to the Trustee within 20 business
days of the date that such Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement has been guaranteed or
incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary.

Each Unsecured Note Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can
be guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Unsecured Note Guarantee, as it relates to such
Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or
the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) and, if that occurs, you
may not receive any payments on the Notes.”

Each Unsecured Note Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of
the Unsecured Indenture described under “—Unsecured Note Guarantees.”

**_Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

After the Acquisition Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of
the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If such Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments in such Restricted Subsidiary by Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of determination or the designation and will
reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under “—Restricted
Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Issuer.
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if such Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct
or indirect parent of the Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under “—
Restricted Payments” or under one of more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” If, at any time, any
Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will

217


-----

thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Unsecured Indenture and any Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is
not permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of
Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis
as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary shall be evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied
with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.”

**_Reports_**

The Unsecured Indenture will provide that so long as any Unsecured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will
provide the Trustee and, upon request, to holders of Unsecured Notes a copy of all of the information and reports
referred to below:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year (or 150 days after the end of the first fiscal year
after the Acquisition Closing Date) (or such longer period as may be permitted by the Commission pursuant to the
reporting requirements for a non-accelerated filer), annual audited consolidated financial statements of Parent that
would have been required to be contained in an Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act if Parent had
been a reporting company under the Exchange Act for such fiscal year (but only to the extent similar information is
presented in this offering memorandum), including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to the periods presented and a report on the annual financial
statements by Parent’s independent accountants (all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a basis
substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information included in this offering memorandum);

(2) from and after the first fiscal quarter ending after the Acquisition Closing Date, within 45 days
after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or 75 days after the end of each of the first
three fiscal quarters ending after the Acquisition Closing Date for which delivery is required hereunder) (or such
longer period as may be permitted by the Commission pursuant to the reporting requirements for a non-accelerated
filer), unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements of Parent (including a balance sheet and related
statements of profit and loss and statement of cash flows) that would have been required to be contained in a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act if Parent had been a reporting company under the
Exchange Act for the interim period as of, and for the period ending on, the end of such fiscal quarter (but only to
the extent similar information is presented in this offering memorandum), including a “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (all of the foregoing financial information to be
prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information included in this offering
memorandum), subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified for filing current reports on Form 8-K by the
Commission, current reports containing substantially all of the information that would be required to be filed in a
current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act on the Acquisition Closing Date pursuant to Items 1.01, 1.03,
2.01, 2.03, 2.04, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01, 5.02(a) through (c) (other than compensation information), and 5.03(b) (in each
case, excluding the financial statements, pro forma financial information and exhibits, if any, that would be required
by Item 9.01) of Form 8-K if Parent had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that
no such current report will be required to be furnished if Parent determines in its good faith judgment that such event
is not material to holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure
would otherwise cause material competitive harm to the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects
of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or contains any trade secrets, privileged or confidential
information obtained from another Person or competitively sensitive information;

218


-----

_provided, however, that in addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuer will be required to make_
available to the holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Unsecured Notes, bona fide market makers in the
Unsecured Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing
analysis of investment in the Unsecured Notes) such information by (i) posting to its website (or the website of any
direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or of a Subsidiary of Parent) or on IntraLinks or any comparable passwordprotected online data system, in each case, subject to the extensions provided for in clauses (1) and (2) above, within
15 days after the time the Issuer would be required to provide such information pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3)
above, as applicable, or (ii) otherwise providing substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined
by the Issuer in good faith) (it being understood that, without limitation, making such reports available on
Bloomberg or another comparable private electronic information service shall constitute substantially comparable
availability). The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such reports to such holders, bona fide prospective
investors in the Unsecured Notes, bona fide market makers in the Unsecured Notes affiliated with any initial
purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Unsecured Notes)
on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information
as confidential, (ii) not use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other than their
investment or potential investment in the Unsecured Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the
information contained therein) and information; and the Issuer may deny access to any competitively-sensitive
information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any holders, bona fide prospective
investors in the Unsecured Notes, bona fide market makers in the Unsecured Notes affiliated with any initial
purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Unsecured Notes)
that is a competitor of Parent and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the
provision of such information and reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Issuer will not be required to furnish any information, financial
statements, certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the Commission with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, or
(iii) Rule 3-01(e), Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (b) such reports will not be
required to contain any segment reporting, (c) such reports shall not be required to present compensation required by
Item 402 of Regulation S-K or otherwise or beneficial ownership information; and (d) the information and reports
referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be required to include any
exhibits required by Item 15 of Form 10-K, Item 6 of Form 10-Q or Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the holders of
the Unsecured Notes if the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer has (i) filed such reports with the
Commission via the EDGAR (or successor) filing system or if such reports are otherwise publicly available, or (ii)
posted such reports on the Issuer’s (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of Parent)
website. The Trustee will have no responsibility to determine whether such posting has occurred.

For so long as any Subsidiaries of Parent have been designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required to be provided by this covenant will include a reasonably
detailed summary presentation (which need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors), either on the face of the
financial statements, in the footnotes thereto, in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” or other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of Parent.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any
Unsecured Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to holders of the Unsecured Notes and to prospective investors,
upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or
any successor provision).

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information and other information and
documents required to be provided as described above may be, rather than those of Parent, those of (a) any
predecessor or successor of Parent or any entity meeting the requirements of clause (b) or (c) of this paragraph, (b)

219


-----

any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent that, together with its consolidated Subsidiaries, constitutes substantially all
of the assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (“Qualified Reporting Subsidiary”) or (c) any direct or
indirect parent of Parent; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such Qualified Reporting
Subsidiary of Parent or such direct or indirect parent of Parent, the same is accompanied by consolidating
information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary of Parent) or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuer or a third party, that
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary
or such parent entity (as the case may be), on the one hand, and the information relating to Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information
referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by Parent’s independent
accountants.

So long as Unsecured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(a) within 15 business days after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant, use commercially reasonable efforts to hold a
conference call, at a time selected by the Issuer, to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant
reporting period (it being understood that any such call may be combined with any similar call held for any of
Parent’s or the Issuer’s other lenders or security holders); and

(b) post to its or the Issuer’s website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or of a
Subsidiary of Parent) or on IntraLinks or any comparable password-protected online data system, which will require
a confidentiality acknowledgment, prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with
clause (a) of this paragraph, announcing the time and date of such conference call and either including all
information necessary to access the call or informing holders, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with
any initial purchaser and securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the
applicable password or other login information.

Any Person who requests or accesses such financial information required by this covenant will be required
to represent to the Issuer (to the reasonable good faith satisfaction of the Issuer) that:

(1) it is a holder, a Beneficial Owner of the Unsecured Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the
Unsecured Notes or a bona fide market maker in the Unsecured Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser or a bona
fide securities analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Unsecured Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such information confidential and will not communicate the information to any Person
and not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
and

(4) it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is principally engaged in a
Permitted Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenue from operating a Permitted Business.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Issuer to comply with any of its obligations
hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will not constitute an Event of
Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder. To the extent any
information is not provided within the time periods specified in this covenant and such information is subsequently
provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default
with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

The delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only
and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of any information
contained therein.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

The Unsecured Indenture shall provide that, as it relates to any action being taken in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of (i) determining compliance with any provision of the Unsecured
Indenture that requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio and Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio, or (ii) testing availability under baskets
set forth in the Unsecured Indenture (including baskets determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or Total
Assets, as applicable), in each case, at the option of Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in
connection with any Limited Condition Transaction to be evidenced by delivery of an Officer’s Certificate to the
Trustee, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder shall be
made (1) in the case of any acquisition (including by way of merger) or similar Investment (including the
assumption or incurrence of Indebtedness in connection therewith), at the time of (or, in the case of any calculation
or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four
consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on
which such calculation is made at the time of) either (x) the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to
such acquisition or Investment, (y) the public announcement of an intention to make an offer in respect of the target
of such acquisition or Investment or (z) the consummation of such acquisition or Investment, (2) in the case of any
Restricted Payment, at the time of (or, in the case of any calculation or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or
as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such calculation is made at the time of) (x) the
irrevocable declaration of such Restricted Payment or (y) the making of such Restricted Payment and (3) in the case
of any voluntary or optional payment or prepayment on or redemption or acquisition for value of any Indebtedness
subject to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments,” at the time of (or, in the case
of any calculation or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently ended
period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made at the time of) (x) delivery of irrevocable (which may be
conditional) notice with respect to such payment or prepayment or redemption or acquisition of such Indebtedness
or (y) the making of such voluntary or optional payment or prepayment on or redemption or acquisition for value of
any Indebtedness (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, for the Limited Condition Transaction (and the other transactions to
be entered into in connection therewith), Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to
take such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such ratio, test or basket, such ratio, test or
basket shall be deemed to have been complied with. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT
Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test
Date would have failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket,
including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets of Parent or the Person subject to such
Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets,
tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations;
_provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if financial statements for one or more subsequent_
periods of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole
discretion, to re-determine all such financial ratios or tests, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently
ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made on the basis of such financial statements, in which case such
date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the LCT Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and
financial metrics. If the Issuer has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection
with any calculation of any ratio, test or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or
Permitted Liens, the making of Restricted Payments, the making of any Permitted Investment, mergers, the
conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of Parent, the prepayment, redemption,
purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of Indebtedness, or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary (each, a
“Subsequent Transaction”) following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such
Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement, public announcement or
irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, revoked or expires without consummation
of such Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining whether such Subsequent Transaction is
permitted under the Unsecured Indenture, any such ratio, test or basket shall be required to be satisfied on a Pro
Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith
(including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Unsecured Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption, offer to purchase or otherwise) of
the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Unsecured Notes;

(3) failure by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after notice by the Trustee to the
Issuer or by the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes then outstanding to
the Issuer and the Trustee to comply with any of the agreements in the Unsecured Indenture (other than a default
referred to in clause (1) or (2) above); provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the Unsecured Indenture
provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such default or breach
shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Affiliate) of Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or the Issuer (or the payment of which is guaranteed by Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a
Significant Subsidiary or the Issuer), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date
of the Unsecured Indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on any such Indebtedness at final
Stated Maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity, and, in each case, the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under
which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates at least the
greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(5) failure by Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or the Issuer to
pay final non-appealable judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of
the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (other than any judgments covered by
indemnities or insurance policies issued by reputable companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or
stayed, for a period of 60 days, after the applicable judgment becomes final and non-appealable;

(6) except as permitted by the Unsecured Indenture, any Unsecured Note Guarantee of Parent or a
Significant Subsidiary of Parent is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any
reason to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of the Unsecured Indenture), or Parent or
any Significant Subsidiary of Parent, or any Person acting on behalf Parent or such Significant Subsidiary of Parent,
as applicable, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Unsecured Note Guarantee and any such Default
continues for 10 days;

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Unsecured Indenture with respect to
Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer; or

(8) failure by the Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption as described under “—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to
either Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries of Parent that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer, all outstanding
Unsecured Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of

222


-----

Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Unsecured Notes by notice to the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee if given by holders of Unsecured
Notes) may declare all the Unsecured Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Unsecured Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. In case an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing, for purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Unsecured Notes that have directed the
Trustee, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Unsecured Notes shall be calculated by the
Trustee or its agent using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such other services as
may be selected by the Trustee or its agent in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on
the date that is two business days prior to the date of such direction. The Trustee shall have no liability for making
such calculation. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Unsecured Notes notice of any continuing Default
or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on the Unsecured Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Unsecured Notes because an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in clause (4) under the first
paragraph of “—Events of Default and Remedies” (excluding any resulting payment default under the Unsecured
Indenture or the Unsecured Notes), the declaration of acceleration of the Unsecured Notes shall be automatically
annulled if such Indebtedness is paid or otherwise acquired or retired or the holders of all Indebtedness described in
clause (4) have rescinded or waived the declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 20
business days of the date of such declaration of acceleration of the Unsecured Notes, and if the annulment of the
acceleration of the Unsecured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction, and all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal or interest on the Unsecured Notes
that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Unsecured Notes, have been cured or waived and all
amounts owing to the Trustee have been paid.

The Unsecured Indenture will provide that if a Default is deemed to occur solely as a consequence of the
existence of another Default (the “Initial Default”), then, at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers under the Unsecured Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Unsecured
Notes unless such holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of
principal or interest, if any, when due, no holder of an Unsecured Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Unsecured Indenture or the Unsecured Notes unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes
make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder or holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security and/or indemnity
satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Unsecured Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes by
written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Unsecured Notes, rescind an acceleration or

223


-----

waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Unsecured Indenture, if the rescission
would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of
principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, the Unsecured Notes (except nonpayment of principal,
premium, if any, or interest on the Unsecured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the
Unsecured Notes).

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders
(other than any holder that is a Regulated Bank, an initial purchaser or its Affiliate (in each case, as evidenced by
delivery of an officer’s certificate to the Trustee from such initial purchaser or Affiliate certifying as to its status as
an initial purchaser or Affiliate thereof)) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written
representation from each such holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder
is DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees, that such holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”),
which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default, shall be deemed repeated
at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In
addition, each Directing Holder is deemed at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction to covenant to provide the
Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such noteholder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification
_Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees, any_
Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of
the notes in lieu of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees and DTC or Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification
Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that the Issuer has instituted
litigation with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the
cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending
a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the
delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Unsecured Notes, the Issuer provides to the
Trustee an Officers’ Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure
period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or
Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any
remedy stayed until such time as the Issuer provides the Trustee with an Officers’ Certificate that the Verification
Covenant has been satisfied; provided that the Issuer shall promptly deliver such Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee
upon becoming aware that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied. Any breach of the Position Representation
(as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee) shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of
Unsecured Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been
insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the
effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall
be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default;
provided, however, this shall not invalidate any indemnity or security provided by the Directing Holders to the
Trustee which obligations shall continue to survive.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of bankruptcy or similar
proceedings shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing two paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction,
Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officer’s Certificate or other document delivered to it pursuant to

224


-----

the foregoing paragraphs, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position
Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated
Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise
and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to
the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether
any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the
Unsecured Indenture or any other agreement or whether or not any holder is a Regulated Bank.

With their acquisition of the Unsecured Notes, each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Unsecured
Notes consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Issuer in accordance with the
terms of this provision. Each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Unsecured Notes waives any and all claims, in
law and/or in equity, against the Trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in
respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes in accordance with this
provision, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a
Noteholder Direction.

Other than in connection with actions resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
of the Trustee, the Issuer waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and agrees not to
commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for
any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or arising out of or in connection with following
instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee will treat all holders equally with respect to their rights under this
“Events of Default and Remedies” provision. In connection with the requisite percentages required under the
Unsecured Indenture to exercise remedies, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat all outstanding Unsecured Notes
equally irrespective of any Position Representation in determining whether the requisite percentage has been
obtained with respect to the initial delivery of the Noteholder Direction.

The Issuer agrees that any and all other actions that the Trustee takes or omits to take in connection with
the foregoing net short language and all fees, costs expenses of the Trustee and its agents and counsel arising as a
result of, or in connection with, the application of such provision shall be covered by the Issuer’s indemnification
obligations set forth in the Unsecured Indenture.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually an Officer’s Certificate regarding compliance with
the Unsecured Indenture within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year (beginning with the first full fiscal year after
the Issue Date, which may be delivered within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year). Upon becoming aware of
any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days of becoming aware of
such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30
day period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default, its status and what action the Issuer
or any Guarantor propose to take with respect thereto.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Equity Holders, including Members**

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or equity holder, including
members, of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, as such, will have any liability
for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Indenture, the
Unsecured Note Guarantees or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their
creation. Each holder of Unsecured Notes by accepting an Unsecured Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Unsecured Notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

225


-----

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may at any time elect to have all of the Issuer’s obligations discharged with respect to a Series
of Unsecured Notes, the outstanding Unsecured Notes of such Series, all obligations of the Guarantors discharged
with respect to their Unsecured Note Guarantees of such Series (“Legal Defeasance”), except for:

(1) the rights of holders of Unsecured Notes of such Series to receive payments in respect of the
principal of premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, such Unsecured Notes when such payments are due from
the trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Unsecured Notes of such Series concerning issuing
temporary Unsecured Notes, registration of transfer of such Unsecured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Unsecured Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in
trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee under the Unsecured Indenture, and
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provision of the Unsecured Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including the obligation to make Change of Control Offers
and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Unsecured Indenture with respect to a Series of Unsecured Notes
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Unsecured Notes of such Series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs,
all Events of Default described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” (except those relating to payments on the
Unsecured Notes, covenants that are not subject to Covenant Defeasance or bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation
or insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Unsecured Notes of such
Series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to a Series of Unsecured
Notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the
Unsecured Notes of such Series, (a) in the case of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, (i) cash in U.S. dollars in an amount,
(ii) non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and
interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in amounts, or (b) in the case of the Euro
Unsecured Notes, (i) cash in euro in an amount, (ii) non-callable euro-denominated Government Securities, the
scheduled payments of principal of and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in
amounts, in each case, as will be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal
of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the outstanding Unsecured Notes of such Series to the stated date for
payment thereof or to the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and all interest, if any, accrued to such
dates, and the Issuer must specify whether such Unsecured Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment
or to a particular redemption date;

(2) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee, (a) in the case of Legal Defeasance, an opinion of counsel to
the effect that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling,
or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to
the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm, that the beneficial owners of outstanding
Unsecured Notes of such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; and (b) in the
case of Covenant Defeasance, an opinion of counsel to the effect the beneficial owners of outstanding Unsecured
Notes of such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such

226


-----

Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been in the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any
similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings);

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Unsecured Indenture and the
agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which the Issuer or any of
the Guarantors is a party or by which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is bound;

(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made
by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Unsecured Notes of such Series over the other creditors of
the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as otherwise provided in this “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”, the Unsecured Indenture,
the Escrow Agreement, the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Note Guarantees may be amended or supplemented
with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Unsecured Notes other than Unsecured Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (including, without
limitation, Additional Unsecured Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Unsecured Notes), and any
existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of,
premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, the Unsecured Notes, except a payment default resulting from an
acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Unsecured Indenture, the Escrow
Agreement, the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes other than Unsecured
Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, Additional Unsecured Notes,
if any) voting as a single class (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or
tender offer or exchange offer for, Unsecured Notes); provided that (x) if any such amendment or waiver will only
affect one Series of Unsecured Notes (or less than all Series of Unsecured Notes) then outstanding under the
Unsecured Indenture, then only the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Unsecured Notes
of such Series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or
exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Unsecured Notes) shall be required and (y) if any such amendment or waiver
by its terms will affect a Series of Unsecured Notes in a manner different and materially adverse relative to the
manner such amendment or waiver affects other Series of Unsecured Notes, then the consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Unsecured Notes of such Series then outstanding (including, in each case,
consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Unsecured Notes) shall be required.

Without the consent of each holder of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes affected, an amendment,
supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Unsecured Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Unsecured Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Unsecured Note or alter or waive any
of the provisions relating to the dates on which the Unsecured Notes may be redeemed or the redemption price
thereof with respect to the redemption of the Unsecured Notes (other than any change to the notice periods with
respect to such redemption);

227


-----

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any
Unsecured Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest,
if any, on, the Unsecured Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of a Series of Unsecured Notes by the holders of
at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes of such Series and a
waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Unsecured Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Unsecured Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults
or the rights of holders of Unsecured Notes to receive payments of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if
any, on, the Unsecured Notes;

(7) subject to the final paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,”
modify the obligation of the Issuer to repurchase Unsecured Notes under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders,”
after the date of an event giving rise to such repurchase obligation;

(8) release Parent or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from any of its obligations under
its Unsecured Note Guarantee or the Unsecured Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured
Indenture;

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions;

(10) make any change to, or modify, the ranking of the Unsecured Notes in respect of right of payment
in a manner that would adversely affect the holders of the Unsecured Notes; or

(11) waive or modify in a manner materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Unsecured
Notes the provisions relating to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Unsecured Notes in a Special Mandatory
Redemption.

An Unsecured Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or its respective Affiliates hold the
Unsecured Note; provided that in determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Unsecured Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver
under the Unsecured Indenture, Unsecured Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its respective Affiliates shall
be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Unsecured Notes, the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Trustee, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Unsecured Indenture, the Escrow
Agreement, the Unsecured Notes or the Unsecured Note Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Unsecured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Unsecured
Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to holders of
Unsecured Notes and Unsecured Note Guarantees in the case of a merger, consolidation, amalgamation or Division
or sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such
Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of
Unsecured Notes or that does not adversely affect the rights under the Unsecured Indenture of any holder in any
material respect;

228


-----

(5) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
the Unsecured Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable;

(6) to conform the text of the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes, the Unsecured Note
Guarantees or the Escrow Agreement to any provision of this “Description of Unsecured Notes”;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Unsecured Notes in accordance with the limitations set
forth in the Unsecured Indenture;

(8) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or an Unsecured Note Guarantee
with respect to the Unsecured Notes in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured Indenture; or

(9) to add or release Unsecured Note Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Unsecured
Indenture.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Unsecured Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. Until
an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a holder is a continuing consent by such holder and
every subsequent holder of all or part of the related Note. Any such holder or subsequent holder may revoke such
consent as to its Unsecured Notes by written notice to the Trustee or the Issuer, received thereby before the date on
which holders of the requisite principal amount of Unsecured Notes have consented to such amendment or waiver.

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment, waiver, modification or deletion of the provisions described
under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,”
shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the Unsecured Notes to institute suit for the enforcement
of any payment on or with respect to, or to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the
Unsecured Notes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Unsecured Indenture with respect to a Series of Unsecured Notes will be discharged and will cease to
be of further effect as to all Unsecured Notes of such Series issued thereunder (except for certain rights of the
Trustee, which shall survive), when:

(1) either:

(a) all Unsecured Notes of such Series that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed
Unsecured Notes of such Series that have been replaced or paid and Unsecured Notes of such Series for whose
payment money has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust, have
been cancelled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all such Unsecured Notes of such Series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable, will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or have been called
for redemption or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of a notice of redemption in the name and at the expense of the Issuer and the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee in a manner that is not revocable, (a) in the case
of the Dollar Unsecured Notes, (i) cash in U.S. dollars in an amount, (ii) non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated
Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a
combination thereof in an amount, or (b) in the case of the Euro Unsecured Notes, (i) cash in euro in an amount, (ii)
non-callable euro-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and interest thereon
will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in an amount, in each case, as will be sufficient (in the case that
Government Securities have been deposited, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal
firm or firm of independent public accountants certified in writing to the Trustee), without consideration of any
reinvestment of interest, to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on such Unsecured Notes of such Series for

229


-----

principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, the Unsecured Notes of such Series to the date of maturity
or redemption;

(2) the Issuer, Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary has paid or caused to be paid all sums then due and
payable by the Issuer and Guarantors under the Unsecured Indenture; and

(3) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee under the Unsecured Indenture to
apply the deposited money toward the payment of the Unsecured Notes of such Series to maturity or to the
redemption date, as the case may be.

In addition, the Issuer must deliver an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel to the Trustee stating
that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied.

**Calculation of U.S. Dollar-Denominated Restrictions**

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any U.S.
dollar-denominated restriction herein, the U.S. dollar equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-U.S. dollar currency shall be calculated using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or
such other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the date such non-U.S. dollar amount is incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Concerning the Trustee**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Unsecured Indenture will contain
provisions that limit the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Issuer and the Guarantors; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest as defined in
the Trust Indenture Act it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to
continue as Trustee (if the Unsecured Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Unsecured Notes will have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to
the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. The Unsecured Indenture will provide that in case an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and powers under the Unsecured
Indenture, to use the same degree of care in their exercise as a prudent man would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will not be under any
obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the Unsecured Indenture at the request or direction of any
holder of Unsecured Notes, unless such holder has offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity
and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.

**Maintenance of Listing**

After the Issue Date, the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the
listing of the Euro Unsecured Notes on the Exchange for so long as the Euro Unsecured Notes are outstanding;
provided that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Euro Unsecured Notes on the Exchange or if
at any time the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to (prior to the delisting of the Euro Unsecured Notes in the event that they were
previously listed on the Exchange) obtain a listing of the Euro Unsecured Notes on another “recognized stock
exchange” as defined in Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom (in which case,
references in this covenant to the Exchange will be deemed to be refer to such other “recognized stock exchange”).
In no event will this covenant require the Issuer to obtain or maintain the listing of the Euro Unsecured Notes on any
exchange that requires financial reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal periods required by the
Commission.

230


-----

**Governing Law; Jury Trial Waiver**

The Unsecured Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. The Unsecured Indenture provides that the
Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee, and each holder of an Unsecured Note by its acceptance thereof, irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding
arising out of or relating to the Unsecured Indenture, the Unsecured Notes or any transaction contemplated thereby.

The Issuer has not qualified and does not expect to qualify the Unsecured Indenture under the Trust
Indenture Act. The Unsecured Indenture will accordingly not be subject to the Trust Indenture Act, and may not
contain provisions corresponding or similar to certain provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that would otherwise
apply if the Unsecured Indenture were so qualified, including §314(a) and §316(b) of the Trust Indenture Act.

such cost savings, operating expense reductions, operating improvements and synergies and (iii) no cost savings,

**DESCRIPTION OF SECURED NOTES**

In this description, references to (i) the term “Issuer” refers to Olympus Water US Holdings Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, (ii) the term “Parent” refers to Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P., a Cayman Islands
exempted limited partnership, acting through Olympus Water Holdings Limited, its general partner, the direct parent
of the Issuer and (iii) the terms “we,” “us” and “our” each refer to Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries
immediately following the Acquisition (as defined below) and the Reorganization (as defined below). Certain
defined terms used in this description but not defined below under “—Certain Definitions” have the meanings
assigned to them in the Secured Indenture (as defined below).

The Issuer will issue $      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the
“Dollar Secured Notes”) and €      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the “Euro
_Secured Notes” and, together with the Dollar Secured Notes, the “Secured Notes” and each, a “Series of Secured_
_Notes”). The Secured Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (as amended and_
supplemented from time to time, the “Secured Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors (as defined below) and
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Trustee”) and collateral agent (the “Notes
_Collateral Agent”). The Dollar Secured Notes and the Euro Secured Notes will each be issued as a separate Series of_
Secured Notes, but, except as otherwise provided below, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Secured Indenture. The Secured Notes will be issued in a private transaction that is not subject to registration under
the Securities Act, and the Secured Indenture will not be qualified under or subject to any of the provisions of the
TIA. The Issuer does not intend to list the Dollar Secured Notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer intends to
apply to list the Euro Secured Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”)
following the Issue Date. There is no assurance that the Euro Secured Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on
the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Secured Notes
will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Secured Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making
an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading.

The Issuer will issue $      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Dollar
_Unsecured Notes”) and €      aggregate principal amount of   % Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Euro Unsecured_
_Notes” and, together with the Dollar Unsecured Notes, the “Unsecured Notes”). The Unsecured Notes will be issued_
pursuant to an indenture, to be dated as of the Issue Date (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the
“Unsecured Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,
N.A., as trustee (the “Unsecured Notes Trustee”). The Dollar Unsecured Notes and the Euro Unsecured Notes will
each be issued as a separate Series of Unsecured Notes, but, except as otherwise provided therein, will be treated as
a single class for all purposes under the Unsecured Indenture. The Unsecured Notes will be issued in a private
transaction that is not subject to registration under the Securities Act, and the Unsecured Indenture will not be
qualified under or subject to any of the provisions of the TIA. The Issuer does not intend to list the Dollar Unsecured
Notes on any securities exchange. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Unsecured Notes on the Exchange
following the Issue Date. There is no assurance that the Euro Unsecured Notes will be listed and admitted to trading
on the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Unsecured
Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Unsecured Notes is not contingent on the Issuer
making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. See “Description of Unsecured Notes.”

This offering is expected to be consummated on     , 2021 (the “Issue Date”), which is expected to be
prior to or concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition and the Reorganization. It is, however, possible,
that the completion of the Acquisition and the Reorganization may be delayed until after the Issue Date. In that case,
unless the offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, pending
consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited), on the Issue Date, (i) an amount
in cash equal to the gross proceeds from the sale of the Dollar Secured Notes into a segregated escrow account (the
“Dollar Escrow Account”) and (ii) an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds from the sale of the Euro Secured
Notes into a segregated escrow account (the “Euro Escrow Account” and, together with the Dollar Escrow Account,
the “Escrow Accounts”), in each case, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”),
dated as of the Issue Date, among the Issuer, the Trustee, the Unsecured Notes Trustee, and The Bank of New York
Mellon, as Escrow Agent (the “Escrow Agent”). An affiliate of Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (“Platinum”) will
issue an irrevocable equity commitment letter to the Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Unsecured Notes
Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Secured Notes, that will require such affiliate of Platinum, (x) in

the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow
Release Conditions (as defined below), to transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the Dollar
Secured Notes, or euros, in the case of the Euro Secured Notes, to the Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and
unpaid interest owing to the holders of such Secured Notes and (y) in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption
(as defined below), to transfer to the Issuer (i) an amount of cash in U.S. dollars necessary to fund the payment of
accrued and unpaid interest on the Dollar Secured Notes and (ii) an amount of cash in euros necessary to fund the
payment of accrued and unpaid interest of the Euro Secured Notes, plus certain fees and expenses of the Trustee, the
Unsecured Notes Trustee and the Escrow Agent.

If this offering is consummated prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, upon initial issuance of the Secured
Notes, the Secured Notes will be obligations solely of the Issuer. Assuming the Escrow Release Conditions (as
defined below) have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Guarantors will become parties to the
Secured Indenture pursuant to a supplemental indenture to the Secured Indenture and the obligations under the
Secured Indenture will become obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors.

The Escrow Agreement, including the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Funds (as defined below),
is more fully described below under “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In the event the
Acquisition Closing Date has not occurred on or before the Outside Date (as defined below) or upon the occurrence
of certain other events, each Series of Secured Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue
price of such Series of Secured Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest (and accretion, if any) from the Issue Date to,
but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). See “—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.”

The net proceeds of this offering of the Secured Notes sold on the Issue Date will be used by the Issuer,
Parent or its Subsidiaries, together with borrowings under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, the New ABL
Credit Agreement, proceeds from the Unsecured Notes and the Equity Investment, to (i) pay the cash portion of the
consideration pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement (as defined below), (ii) repay or redeem or satisfy in full
certain outstanding indebtedness of Solenis (as defined below) and Sigura (as defined below) and/or (iii) pay fees,
commissions and expenses in connection with the Transactions (as defined below), in each case, as described in this
offering memorandum under “Use of Proceeds.”

The following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Secured
Notes, the Security Documents (as defined below), the Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below) and the Escrow
Agreement. It does not restate the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreements or the Escrow Agreement in their entirety and is subject to, and qualified by reference to, all of the
provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements and
the Escrow Agreement. Copies of the Secured Indenture (and any supplemental indentures), the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements and the Escrow Agreement, if applicable, may be obtained from the Issuer
upon request after the Issue Date as set forth below under “—Additional Information.”

**Brief Description of the Secured Notes**

**_The Secured Notes_**

If the Acquisition is not consummated on the Issue Date, prior to the Escrow Release (as defined below),
the Secured Notes will be senior secured obligations of the Issuer secured by the Escrowed Funds on a first priority
basis. From and after the Escrow Release (or on the Issue Date immediately following the Acquisition and
Reorganization if the Acquisition and Reorganization close concurrently with this offering), the Secured Notes will
be senior secured obligations of the Issuer and will:

    - be secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of the Issuer under any
other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral from time to time owned by the
Issuer, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens, as described under “—Security—
Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain
Definitions—Permitted Liens”;

271


-----

    - be secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of the Issuer under any
other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Current Asset Collateral from time to time owned by
the Issuer, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens (including Liens on the Current Asset
Collateral securing any Priority Lien Obligations), as described under “—Security— Collateral,” “—
Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants—Liens” and “—Certain Definitions—
Permitted Liens”;

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with all
existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Issuer (including Indebtedness under the New Credit
Agreements and the Unsecured Notes);

    - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all future Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer, if
any;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and Indebtedness
secured by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the
Collateral (including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the Obligations under the New ABL
Credit Agreement);

    - be effectively equal to any existing and future Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Obligations
under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Priority Lien Obligations of the Issuer (including
Indebtedness under the New ABL Credit Agreement), to the extent of the value of the Current Asset
Collateral securing such obligations;

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of all Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries; and

    - from and after the Acquisition Closing Date, be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by Parent and
each Wholly Owned Subsidiary that guarantees any obligations under the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement.

As described in this offering memorandum under “Use of Proceeds,” as of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma
basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total indebtedness of $4,007 million (including
finance lease obligations and excluding letters of credit), including the Secured Notes, the Unsecured Notes and
borrowings under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and the New ABL Credit Agreement, and we would have
had unused revolving commitments under our New ABL Credit Agreement available to us of $325 million (not
taking into account the impact of the ING RPA remaining outstanding). In addition, under the New Credit
Agreements, we have the option to raise incremental Indebtedness (including incremental term loans and
incremental revolving commitments, as applicable), subject to certain terms and conditions. See “Description of
New Credit Facilities and Other Indebtedness.”

Certain of the operations of Parent will be conducted through its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer). As a
result, the Issuer will be dependent upon dividends and other payments from Parent’s Subsidiaries to generate the
funds necessary to meet its outstanding Indebtedness service and other obligations, and such dividends and other
payments may be restricted by law or the instruments governing the Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries.
Parent’s Subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable the Issuer to make some or all of
the principal and interest payments on its Indebtedness, including the Secured Notes.

272


-----

The Secured Indenture will not be qualified under the TIA, and the TIA shall not apply to or in any way
govern the terms of the Secured Indenture. As a result, no provisions of the TIA will be incorporated into the
Secured Indenture unless expressly incorporated pursuant to this “Description of Secured Notes.”

The registered holder of a Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
holders will have rights under the Secured Indenture.

**_Principal, Maturity and Interest_**

The Issuer will issue $      million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Secured Notes and €
million aggregate principal amount of Euro Secured Notes in this offering. The Dollar Secured Notes and the Euro
Secured Notes will constitute separate Series of Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture but, except as otherwise
provided herein, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Secured Indenture, including for purposes
of voting and taking all other actions permitted by holders of the Secured Notes. For purposes of calculating the
aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes that have consented to or voted in favor of any amendment,
supplement or waiver, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Secured Notes shall be
calculated by the Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such other services
as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date that
is two business days prior to the date of such amendment, supplement or waiver. The Secured Notes will mature on
, 2028.

Subject to compliance with the covenants described below under the caption “—Certain Covenants—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock,” and “—Certain Covenants—
Liens,” the Issuer may issue additional Dollar Secured Notes (“Additional Dollar Secured Notes”) and additional
Euro Secured Notes (“Additional Euro Secured Notes” and, together with the Additional Dollar Secured Notes, the
“Additional Secured Notes”) from time to time after this offering under the Secured Indenture.

Except as otherwise specified, the Dollar Secured Notes offered hereby and any Additional Dollar Secured
Notes subsequently issued under the Secured Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the
Secured Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Except as otherwise
specified, the Euro Secured Notes offered hereby and any Additional Euro Secured Notes subsequently issued under
the Secured Indenture shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Secured Indenture, including
waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Holders of Additional Secured Notes issued will share
equally and ratably in the Collateral with the holders of the Secured Notes issued prior thereto. Unless the context
requires otherwise, references to “Dollar Secured Notes,” “Euro Secured Notes” and “Secured Notes” for all
purposes of the Secured Indenture and this “Description of Secured Notes” include any Additional Secured Notes
that are issued. However, in order for any Additional Dollar Secured Notes to have the same CUSIP number as the
Dollar Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such Additional Dollar Secured Notes must be fungible with
the initial Dollar Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes and in order for any Additional Euro Secured
Notes to have the same CUSIP number as the Euro Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, such Additional
Euro Secured Notes must be fungible with the initial Euro Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Interest on the Dollar Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Euro
Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of   % per annum. Interest on the Secured Notes will accrue from the Issue
Date or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, payable semi-annually on
and      of each year (each such date, an “interest payment date”), commencing on     , 2022, to holders of
record as of the close of business on      or      (whether or not a business day) immediately preceding each
interest payment date. Interest will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. The
Dollar Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in
excess thereof and the Euro Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Secured Notes_**

All payments on (i) the Dollar Secured Notes will be made at the office or agency of the paying agent
maintained for such purpose (the “Dollar Paying Agent”) and (ii) the Euro Secured Notes will be made at the office

273


-----

or agency of the paying agent maintained for such purpose (the “Euro Paying Agent” and, together with the Dollar
Paying Agent, the “paying agents”), in each case, unless the Issuer elects to make interest payments due on an
interest payment date by check mailed to the persons entitled thereto at their address set forth in the register of
holders; provided that if a holder of Secured Notes has given wire transfer instructions to the paying agent at least
fifteen (15) business days prior to an interest payment date, the Issuer will pay all interest on that holder’s Secured
Notes due on an interest payment date in accordance with those instructions. All payments on global notes will be
made in accordance with the applicable procedures of (i) The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”), in the case of the
Dollar Secured Notes and (ii) Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Euro Secured Notes. Payments on the
Secured Notes will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding for taxes, except as otherwise required
by law.

**_Paying Agents and Registrars for the Secured Notes_**

The initial Dollar Paying Agent and registrar for the Dollar Secured Notes will be The Bank of New York
Mellon Trust Company, N.A. The initial Euro Paying Agent and registrar for the Euro Secured Notes will be The
Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch. The Issuer may change the paying agent or registrar without prior
notice to the holders of the Secured Notes, and the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as paying agent or
registrar.

If any Secured Notes are listed on an exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will
satisfy any requirement of such exchange as to paying agents, registrars and transfer agents and will comply with
any notice requirements under such exchange in connection with any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer
agent.

**_Transfer and Exchange_**

A holder may transfer or exchange Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions of the Secured
Indenture. The registrar and the Trustee may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents in connection with a transfer of Secured Notes. Holders of the Secured Notes
will be required to pay all taxes due on transfer. The Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Secured
Note selected for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Secured Note being redeemed in part. Also, the
Issuer will not be required to transfer or exchange any Secured Note for a period of fifteen (15) days before a
selection of Secured Notes to be redeemed.

**_Secured Note Guarantees_**

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Secured Notes will not be guaranteed. On the Acquisition
Closing Date, Parent and each of Parent’s Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries (other than
Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a borrower and/or guarantor under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement will jointly
and severally, irrevocably, fully and unconditionally guarantee on a senior secured basis the performance and
punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the
Issuer under the Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes (including interest, fees and expenses which, but for the
filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to the Issuer, would have accrued on any Obligation, whether or not a
claim is allowed against the Issuer for such interest, fees and expenses in the related bankruptcy proceeding) to the
holders, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee, whether for payment of principal or interest on the Secured
Notes, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being
herein called the “Secured Guaranteed Obligations”).

Each Secured Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor and
will:

    - be secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of such Guarantor under
any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral from time to time owned by
such Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens, as described under “—Security—

274


-----

Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants— Liens” and “—
Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”;

    - be secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of such Guarantor under
any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Current Asset Collateral from time to time owned
by such Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens (including Liens on the Current
Asset Collateral securing any Priority Lien Obligations), as described under “—Security—Collateral,”
“—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants— Liens” and “—Certain
Definitions—Permitted Liens”;

    - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with all
existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including Indebtedness under the
Unsecured Notes and the New Credit Agreements);

    - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of
such Guarantor, if any;

    - be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and Indebtedness
secured by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the
Collateral (including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the Obligations under the New ABL
Credit Agreement);

    - be effectively equal to any existing and future Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Obligations
under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer that is
secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets
securing such Indebtedness;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Priority Lien Obligations of such Guarantor
(including such Guarantor’s guarantee of Indebtedness under the New ABL Credit Agreement), to the
extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral securing such Indebtedness; and

    - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of such Guarantor’s Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries.

Each Secured Note Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount
that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Secured Indenture or the Secured Note
Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to void the
Notes and/or the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) and, if that
occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” After the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer will cause
each Restricted Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is an Excluded Subsidiary or is already a Guarantor) that is a
guarantor or a borrower under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement to execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture, pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee performance and payment of
the Secured Notes on the same senior secured basis. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees.”

Each Secured Note Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph,
shall:

(1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Secured Guaranteed Obligations;

(2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and

275


-----

(3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders
and their successors, transferees and assigns.

A Secured Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released
and discharged upon:

(a) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation,
amalgamation, Division or dissolution) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that
is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if
after such transaction the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or

(b) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, exchange,
disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, Division or
dissolution) is made in compliance with the Secured Indenture;

(c) the Issuer designating such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in
accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” and the
definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”;

(d) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Acquisition Closing Date is
required to guarantee the Secured Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Future Guarantees,” the release or discharge of the Guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of
Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or the repayment of the Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Secured Notes, except by
reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of such Indebtedness or if a release or discharge
is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other Guarantee
or direct obligation;

(e) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as
described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” or if the Issuer’s Obligations under the
Secured Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Secured
Indenture or through redemption or repurchase of all of the Secured Notes or otherwise) in accordance with
the terms of the Secured Indenture;

(f) the release or discharge of the Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Subsidiary
Guarantor of the Obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment
under or the termination or repayment of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or if such release or
discharge is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such
Guarantee or direct obligation;

(g) such Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary;

(h) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent, including
as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing Indebtedness or any exercise of
remedies in respect thereof in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreements, as applicable; provided that
such Subsidiary Guarantor shall only be released if such Subsidiary became a non-Wholly Owned
Subsidiary pursuant to a transaction where such Subsidiary becomes a bona fide joint venture where the
other Person taking an equity interest in such Subsidiary is not an Affiliate of Parent (other than as a result
of such joint venture);

(i) as described in “—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Secured Notes
Rated Investment Grade”; or

(j) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.”

276


-----

The Secured Note Guarantee of Parent will be released if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or
covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” if the Issuer’s
Obligations under the Secured Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the
Secured Indenture as described below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or through redemption or repurchase of
all the Secured Notes or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture or if there is a release or
discharge of such Secured Note Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, Parent of the Obligations under the New Term
Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of the New Term Loan
Credit Agreement or a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of
remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation.

Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and
claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets
and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the Secured Notes.
The Secured Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and
preferred stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Secured Indenture will contain
limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that Parent and certain of its Subsidiaries may incur, such
limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. See “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” below.

As of the Acquisition Closing Date, all of Parent’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted
Subsidiaries.” However, under the circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants,” the Issuer will be
permitted to designate certain of Parent’s Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” The Unrestricted Subsidiaries
will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Secured Indenture and will not guarantee the Secured Notes.

On the Acquisition Closing Date, each of Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a
borrower and/or guarantor under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement will be a Guarantor. For the twelve months
ended June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries
represented approximately 62% of our Net sales and approximately 62% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted
EBITDA. As of June 30, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our non-Guarantor
subsidiaries represented approximately 74% of our total assets (excluding intercompany receivables and investments
in subsidiaries) and approximately 19% of our total liabilities (excluding intercompany payables).

**_Security_**

_Collateral_

_General_

The Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens on the Collateral on an equal
and ratable basis with all Parity Lien Obligations. These Liens will be senior in priority to the Liens securing all
Priority Lien Obligations in respect of Fixed Asset Collateral and junior in priority to the Liens securing all Priority
Lien Obligations in respect of Current Asset Collateral.

The Liens on the Collateral that will secure the Secured Notes and Secured Note Guarantees will be granted
under the Security Documents in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the holders of the
Secured Notes and the Trustee. The Liens on the Collateral that secure the Obligations under the New Term Loan
Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Obligations”) will be granted to the collateral agent under the New Term Loan
Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Collateral Agent”) pursuant to separate security documentation. The relative
rights among the creditors of the Term Loan Obligations and the holders of the other Parity Lien Obligations
(including the holders of the Secured Notes) will be governed by the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement as set forth
below under the caption “—Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” The Liens on the
Collateral that secure the Obligations under the New ABL Credit Agreement (the “Priority Lien Obligations”) will
be granted to the collateral agent under the New ABL Credit Agreement (the “ABL Collateral Agent”) pursuant to
separate security documentation. The relative rights among the creditors of the Priority Lien Obligations, on the one
hand, and the holders of the Parity Lien Obligations (including the holders of the Secured Notes), on the other hand,

277


-----

will be governed by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement as described below under the caption “—Intercreditor
Arrangements—ABL Intercreditor Agreement.”

The Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets and property of the Issuer and the Guarantors,
whether real, personal or mixed, other than the Excluded Assets and other than any assets released from the
Collateral.

The Collateral will exclude the following assets and property (“Excluded Assets”), including, without
limitation:

(1) (i) any fee-owned real property that (A) is located outside the United States, (B) has a fair market
value equal to or less than $25.0 million or (C) contains improvements located in an area identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency) as a “special flood hazard area” and (ii) any real
property leasehold interests;

(2) interest in any contracts, permits, licenses, leases, Accounts, General Intangibles (other than any
Equity Interests), Payment Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Letter-of-Credit Rights and Promissory Notes, if the grant of a
security interest or Lien therein is prohibited as a matter of law, rule or regulation or under the terms of such
contracts, permits, licenses, leases, Accounts, General Intangibles, Payment Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Letter-ofCredit Rights and Promissory Notes, in each case after giving effect to any applicable Uniform Commercial Code,
other applicable law and principles of equity;

(3) the voting Equity Interests of (i) any first tier Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC in excess of 65% of
the outstanding voting Equity Interests thereof and (ii) any FSHCO in excess of 65% of the outstanding voting
Equity Interests thereof;

(4) assets subject to Capital Lease Obligations, purchase money financing and cash to secure letter of
credit reimbursement obligations to the extent such Capital Lease Obligations, purchase money financing or letters
of credit are permitted under the Secured Indenture and the terms thereof prohibit a grant of a security interest
therein;

(5) assets sold to a person who is not the Issuer or a Guarantor in compliance with the Secured
Indenture;

(6) assets owned by a Guarantor after the release of the guaranty of the Obligations under the Secured
Notes of such Guarantor pursuant to the Secured Indenture;

(7) any motor vehicles and any other goods subject to a certificate of title law of any state (to the
extent a security interest therein cannot be perfected by a UCC filing);

(8) any application for registration of a trademark filed with the PTO on an intent-to-use basis until
such time (if any) as a statement of use or amendment to allege use is accepted by the PTO, at which time such
trademark shall automatically become part of the Collateral and subject to the security interest of the Security
Documents;

(9) Equity Interests in any Person (i) other than the Issuer and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries to the
extent a pledge thereof is not permitted by the terms of such Person’s charter documents or joint venture or
shareholders agreements and other organizational documents and (ii) to the extent a pledge thereof is not permitted
by any law, rule or regulation, in each case of clause (i) and (ii) after giving effect to Article 9 of the UCC and other
applicable law;

(10) any Letter-of-Credit Right (to the extent a security interest in such Letter-of-Credit Right cannot
be perfected by a UCC filing) and any Commercial Tort Claim, in each case, with a value (as determined in good
faith by Issuer) of less than an amount agreed in the Security Documents;

278


-----

(11) assets to the extent the cost of obtaining a security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in
relation to the benefits to the holders of the notes of the security afforded thereby as determined by the Issuer in
good faith in writing delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent;

(12) “margin stock” (within the meaning of Regulation U);

(13) Excluded Accounts (other than any account included in such definition solely by virtue of being a
zero balance account);

(14) Equity Interests in Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Immaterial Subsidiaries;

(15) certain segregated deposits that constitute Permitted Liens; and

(16) any asset to the extent granting a security interest in such asset would result in a material adverse
tax consequence to any Permitted Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Issuer
and notified in writing to the Notes Collateral Agent; provided that this clause (16) shall not apply to any
intercompany Indebtedness for borrowed money issued by in connection with the Transactions;

_provided, however, that Excluded Assets will not include (a) any proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any_
Excluded Assets (except to the extent such proceeds, substitutions or replacements would themselves constitute
Excluded Assets) or (b) any asset of the Issuer or the Guarantors that secures Obligations with respect to the New
ABL Credit Agreement or the New Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided, further, that capitalized terms used in
clauses (2) and (10) above and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the UCC
as in effect on the date hereof in the State of New York.

_Certain Limitations on the Collateral_

No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Secured Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation
will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount
sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Secured Notes. The Collateral securing our obligations under the Secured
Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees is shared with other creditors. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral
may not be sufficient to repay the creditors of Priority Lien Obligations and Parity Lien Obligations, including the
holders of the Secured Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of
factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general
economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the
Collateral will be dependent on numerous factors, including the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such
time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may
be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation,
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of
the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ Obligations in respect of the Secured Notes
and the Secured Note Guarantees (after taking into account all of our other Indebtedness that is secured on all or any
portion of the Collateral on a senior or pari passu basis). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any,
realized by holders of the Secured Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the Secured Notes and the Obligations
in respect of the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees (after application of any proceeds of the Current
Asset Collateral to the Priority Lien Obligations) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and
the Guarantors’ unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated Obligations, including the
Unsecured Notes and trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third
parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of
the Collateral or the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The
Issuer may also issue Additional Secured Notes after the Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur Parity
Lien Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations that would be secured by the Collateral, the effect of which would be
to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by the Collateral or secured on a priority basis
with respect to the Current Asset Collateral. The ability of the holders to realize on the Collateral would also be
subject to applicable bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to
the Notes and Our Indebtedness—The value of the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may not be sufficient to

279


-----

satisfy our obligations under the Secured Notes and the other obligations secured by an equal and ratable lien on the
Collateral or a senior lien on the Current Asset Collateral.”

_Release of Collateral_

The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the
Collateral from the Liens securing the Secured Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in part, as to any property or assets constituting Collateral, to enable us to consummate the
disposition of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor) to the
extent permitted under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger,
Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(2) if such property becomes an Excluded Asset;

(3) as to the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor that is released from its Secured Note
Guarantee in accordance with the Secured Indenture;

(4) as described under “—Intercreditor Arrangements”; or

(5) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below.

The security interests in all Collateral securing each Series of Secured Notes also will be released upon (i)
payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, on, such Series of
Secured Notes and all other Obligations with respect to such Series of Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture,
the Secured Note Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such
principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, are paid (including pursuant to a
satisfaction and discharge of the Secured Indenture as described below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge”) or (ii)
a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to such Series of Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture
as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.”

_Creation and Perfection of Certain Security Interests Post-Closing_

Certain mortgages with respect to the Collateral (including any related title insurance and surveys) may not
be in place on the Acquisition Closing Date or certain other security interests (including control agreements with
respect to deposit accounts to the extent required hereunder) may not be created or perfected on the Acquisition
Closing Date. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness— Security interests over certain
of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the Secured Notes are issued. Any issues that we are
not able to resolve in connection with the granting of such security interests may impact the value of the Collateral.
Creation or perfection of such security interests after the issuance of the Secured Notes increases the risk that the
liens granted by those security interests could be avoided in bankruptcy.” To the extent any such security interest
could not be created or perfected or title insurance or surveys could not be obtained by such date, the Issuer and the
Guarantors will agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all acts and
things that would be required to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created and enforceable and
perfected, to the extent required by the Secured Indenture or the Security Documents, and obtain title insurance and
surveys within 90 days (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the New
Term Loan Credit Agreement with respect to Fixed Asset Collateral, or the ABL Collateral Agent may have agreed
to under the New ABL Credit Agreement with respect to Current Asset Collateral) of the Acquisition Closing Date;
_provided that the Issuer and Guarantors will enter into the Security Documents and file UCC financing statements_
on the Acquisition Closing Date. There will be no independent assurance prior to issuance of the Secured Notes that
all assets or properties contemplated to be mortgaged or pledged as security for the Secured Notes will be mortgaged
or pledged, or that we hold the real or personal property interests we represent we hold or that we may mortgage or
pledge such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such real or personal property interests other than
those permitted by the Secured Indenture. Delivery of mortgages or other documents necessary to create or perfect

280


-----

security interests in other Collateral after the Issue Date increases the risk that the mortgages or other security
interests could be avoidable in bankruptcy.

Additionally, the Secured Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the Secured
Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of
the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the holders of the Secured Notes and the Trustee; provided that
no control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts shall be required (the “Perfection
_Exceptions”)._

Failure to create and perfect a security interest in the Collateral or to obtain title insurance, as required by
the Secured Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the Secured Notes, within the
required time period will constitute an Event of Default (as defined below) if and to the extent provided under
clauses (3), (9) or (10) under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” below. Neither the Trustee nor the
Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Secured Notes has any duty or responsibility
to see to or monitor the performance of Parent and its Subsidiaries with regard to these matters or to determine
whether commercially reasonable efforts have been made by the Issuer.

_Intercreditor Arrangements_

The Liens on the Collateral securing the Secured Notes will be subject to two separate intercreditor
agreements. On the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes Collateral Agent will, together with the Term Loan
Collateral Agent, enter into the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to set forth their relative rights in the Collateral,
which will provide for the pari passu nature of their Liens, including any Liens that may, in the future, secure
additional Parity Lien Indebtedness. In addition, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes Collateral Agent will,
together with the Term Loan Collateral Agent and the ABL Collateral Agent, enter into the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, which will govern the relative rights of the Liens on the Collateral in favor of the ABL Collateral Agent,
the Term Loan Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent, and will provide for the senior priority of the ABL
Collateral Agent in the Current Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the
Notes Collateral Agent and the representative of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, and also will provide for the
senior priority of the Term Loan Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent in the Fixed Asset Collateral
relative to the Liens thereon of the ABL Collateral Agent.

If any other Indebtedness is designated as Parity Lien Indebtedness and is permitted by the terms of the
Secured Indenture to be secured by the Collateral, the representatives of the holders of such other Indebtedness will
also become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The Secured
Indenture will provide that such intercreditor agreements may be amended from time to time without the consent of
the holders of the Secured Notes to, among other things, add other parties.

Holders of the Secured Notes will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Notes
Collateral Agent (and Trustee, if applicable) to enter into and perform its obligations under the Intercreditor
Agreements, binding the holders of the Secured Notes to the terms thereof by their acceptance of the Secured Notes.

_Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement_

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” will have the right
to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the
Term Loan Collateral Agent and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of
Parity Lien Obligations that are Term Loan Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement
Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent
Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the authorized representative of the Series of Parity Lien
Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding Series of
Parity Lien Obligations (excluding the Series of Term Loan Obligations) with respect to such Collateral, but solely
to the extent that such Series of Parity Lien Obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the Term Loan
Obligations then outstanding (the “Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”); provided, however, that if there are
two outstanding Series of Parity Lien Obligations which have an equal outstanding principal amount, the Series of

281


-----

Parity Lien Obligations with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have the larger outstanding principal
amount for purposes of this definition.

With respect to any Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured
Party shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over,
attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any
action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any
Collateral.

The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent
was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in
the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and (b) the Controlling
Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral
Agent certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and
that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Parity Lien Obligations
has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Parity Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full
(whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that
Series of Parity Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will be
stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the
Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action (including delivery
by the Controlling Collateral Agent of a notice to the ABL Collateral Agent that purports to commence an ABL
Standstill Period (or similar term defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) thereunder) with respect to such
Collateral or any portion thereof, (2) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent is stayed under the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement actions with respect to such Collateral or any portion thereof or
(3) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor
under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Term
Loan Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent will have no rights to take any action under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent
or unless expressly permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal
with the Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling
Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or
action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the
Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral.
Each of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations also will agree that it will not contest or support any other person in
contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity,
attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations in all or
any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the Notes Collateral Agent
and each other authorized representative or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations may file a proof of claim or
statement of interest with respect to the Parity Lien Obligations owed to such party; (ii) the Notes Collateral Agent
and each other authorized representative or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations may (but shall not be
obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of
such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material
respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral
Agent or any other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent
with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the Notes Collateral Agent and each other
authorized representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in
opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or

282


-----

otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such party, including any claims secured by the
Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Parity Lien
Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in
respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any holder of Parity Lien
Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement but including the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the payments, proceeds
or distribution of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral received by any authorized
representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations and any such distribution or payment in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding to which the Parity Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement
(subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds, or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) shall,
subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, be applied
among the Parity Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the Parity Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after
payment of all amounts owing to each authorized representative (in its capacity as the agent for the applicable Parity
Lien Obligations) and the Trustee; provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of Parity Lien Obligations and
solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and not any other
documents governing Parity Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire
amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the Parity Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a)
and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law
in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series of Parity Lien
Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the Parity Lien
Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the
Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding.

It is the intention of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series that the holders of Parity Lien
Obligations of such Series (and not the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of any other Series) bear the risk of any
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series are
unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity
Lien Obligations), (y) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest
in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security
interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity Lien Obligations) on a basis
ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of
any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations or the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Parity Lien
Obligations that is not Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to
any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect
to any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such
Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations (including,
without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations permitted by
the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement ) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the
extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Parity
Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series are
modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy
Code), any reference to such Parity Lien Obligations or the Parity Lien Documents governing such Parity Lien
Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified.

None of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may institute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or
other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations
seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any
Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may seek to have any Collateral or any part
thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Parity Lien
Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to
any Parity Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any
insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any

283


-----

intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Parity Lien Obligations, then it must hold
such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Parity Lien Obligations and promptly transfer
such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement
with respect to Current Asset Collateral, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise
exercises remedies against any Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending
at the time) the Liens in favor of the other authorized representatives for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the
holders of the Secured Notes and each other Series of holders of Parity Lien Obligations upon such Collateral will
automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Collateral realized therefrom will be
applied as described in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

Each holder of Parity Lien Obligations will acknowledge that the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding
under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor. The
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of DIP Financing (as defined below)
to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the
use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law), each holder of Parity Lien Obligations will agree not to object to any such
DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) and/or to any use of
cash collateral that constitutes Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of
the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security Documents and Secured Indenture to the extent the
Controlling Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent) with respect to such Collateral opposes or objects to
such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP
Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties,
each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Collateral on the same terms as
the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any holders of Parity Lien Obligations
constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank
_pari passu with the Liens on any such Collateral granted to secure the Parity Lien Obligations of the Controlling_
Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Collateral as set
forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement ), in each case so long as:

(A) the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such
Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds, products, offsprings, profits, or rents, as applicable,
thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other holders of
Parity Lien Obligations (other than any Liens of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing
Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the insolvency or liquidation proceeding;

(B) the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or
replacement collateral pledged to any holder of Parity Lien Obligations as adequate protection or otherwise in
connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the holders of
Parity Lien Obligations as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (other than any Liens of the holders of
Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens);

(C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Parity
Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and

(D) if any holders of Parity Lien Obligations are granted adequate protection, including in the form of
periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such
adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement;

_provided that the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_
secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of
such Series or its representative that do not constitute Collateral; and provided, further, that the holders of Parity

284


-----

Lien Obligations receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations
receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such holders of Parity Lien
Obligations in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral.

The holders of Parity Lien Obligations will acknowledge that the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series
may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Parity Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed,
replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from
time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds of the Collateral set forth in the
Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the holders of Parity
Lien Obligations of any Series.

_ABL Intercreditor Agreement_

_General_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides, among other things, that, notwithstanding the date, time,
method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing the Obligations under the Secured
Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations (including the Obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement)
granted on the Collateral or of any Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations granted on the Collateral and
notwithstanding any provision of any UCC, or any other applicable law or the New ABL Credit Agreement, the
New Term Loan Credit Agreement or the Secured Indenture, or any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect,
the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations, the Secured Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, and whether
or not such Liens securing, or purporting to secure, any Priority Lien Obligations or the Secured Notes or any other
Parity Lien Obligations are subordinated to any Lien securing any other obligation of the Issuer, or any other
Guarantor or any other Person or otherwise subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or lapsed, or any other
circumstance whatsoever, the ABL Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Priority Lien
Obligations, and each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Secured Notes and the
other Parity Lien Obligations, each agrees that (i) any Lien of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Current Asset
Collateral, whether now or hereafter held by or on behalf of the ABL Collateral Agent or any holders of Priority
Lien Obligations or any agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute,
operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on the Current Asset
Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Parity Lien Obligations (including the obligations under the Secured
Notes), and (ii) any Lien of the Parity Lien Representatives on the Fixed Asset Collateral, whether now or hereafter
held by or on behalf of the Parity Lien Representatives, any holder of the Secured Notes or other Parity Lien
Obligations or any agent or trustee therefor regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute,
operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be senior in all respects to all Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral
securing or purporting to secure any Priority Lien Obligations. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that
the Current Asset Collateral pledged to secure the Priority Lien Obligations will include certain collateral of foreign
subsidiaries of Parent (the “Foreign Collateral”) that will not secure the Parity Lien Obligations and no Parity Lien
Representative will commence or take any enforcement action with respect to the Foreign Collateral and will be
subject to certain other restrictions with respect to the Foreign Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will
provide that the Fixed Asset Collateral pledged to secure the Parity Lien Obligations will include certain real estate
assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (the “Real Estate Assets”) that will not secure the Priority Lien Obligations
and no ABL Collateral Agent will commence or take any enforcement action with respect to the Real Estate Assets
and will be subject to certain other restrictions with respect to the Real Estate Assets. The ABL Collateral Agent, on
behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, and each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of
itself and/or the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, each further agrees that during
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will be enforceable as a subordination
agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other
applicable bankruptcy law, and the ABL Collateral Agent, the Parity Lien Representatives, and the agents for any
other Parity Lien Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations will have the rights to seek adequate protection in such
proceedings in accordance with and subject to certain limitations set forth under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, including with respect to the relative priority of their respective security interests in the Current Asset
Collateral and the Fixed Asset Collateral.

285


-----

Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent” will have the
right to act or refrain from acting on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations
with respect to any Collateral. The Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent will initially be the Term Loan
Collateral Agent and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change
Date occurs under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.

_Exercise of Remedies_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that (x) so long as Priority Lien Obligations remain
outstanding, none of the Parity Lien Representative, nor any other holder of the Secured Notes or other Parity Lien
Obligations may (A) exercise any rights or remedies against the Current Asset Collateral or institute any
enforcement action with respect to such rights or remedies; provided, however, that the Controlling Fixed Asset
Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security
Documents and Secured Indenture to the extent the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral
Agent) or any Person authorized by it may exercise any or all such rights or remedies after the passage of a period of
at least 180 days has elapsed since the later of: (A) the date on which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent
(or the applicable Parity Lien Representative) declared the existence of an Event of Default and demanded the
repayment of all the principal amount of any Parity Lien Obligations; and (B) the date on which the ABL Collateral
Agent received notice from the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent of such declaration of an Event of Default
and that the Parity Lien Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of the acceleration
thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable documents (the “Fixed Asset Standstill
_Period”); provided, further, however, that notwithstanding anything in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to the_
contrary, in no event shall any Parity Lien Representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations (A) exercise any
rights or remedies with respect to (x) the Current Asset Collateral if, notwithstanding the expiration of the Fixed
Asset Standstill Period, the ABL Collateral Agent (or any person authorized by it) or the holders of Priority Lien
Obligations shall have commenced and be diligently pursuing the exercise of their rights or remedies with respect to
all or any material portion of such Collateral (prompt notice of such exercise to be given to the Controlling Fixed
Asset Collateral Agent) or shall be stayed under applicable law from exercising such rights and remedies or (y) the
Foreign Collateral, (B) contest or object to any proceeding or action brought by the agents for any Priority Lien
Obligations with respect to the Current Asset Collateral or (C) object to the forbearance by the holders of Priority
Lien Obligations from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights
or remedies relating to the Current Asset Collateral or such Priority Lien Obligations and (y) reciprocal restrictions
apply to the ABL Collateral Agent for enforcing rights and remedies against the Fixed Asset Collateral. Subject to
the foregoing, the ABL Collateral Agent and holders of the senior liens on the Current Asset Collateral and the
Fixed Asset Collateral have the exclusive right (subject to the Fixed Asset Standstill Period) to enforce rights,
exercise remedies and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to the
Collateral in which they hold the senior lien without consultation with any agent or holders of the liens with junior
priority in the same Collateral; provided that the Parity Lien Representatives or the holders of the Secured Notes or
any other Parity Lien Obligations may;

(1) file a claim with respect to the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations; provided that
an insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any
Guarantor;

(2) take any action in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its Lien on any of
the Collateral; provided that such action shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement and shall not be adverse to the priority status of the Liens on the Current
Asset Collateral, or the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority Lien
Obligations to exercise remedies in respect thereof;

(3) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion,
claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise
seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the holders of the Secured Notes, including any
claims secured by the Current Asset Collateral, if any, in each case in accordance with the terms of
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement;

286


-----

(4) file any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements which assert rights or interests available to
unsecured creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor arising under either any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with, or
prohibited by, the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement;

(5) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim,
make other filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with
the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to the obligations under the Secured
Notes and the Fixed Asset Collateral; and

(6) exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral (other than the Foreign
Collateral) after the termination of the Fixed Asset Standstill Period to the extent permitted by the
ABL Intercreditor Agreement.

The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will be subject to similar
restrictions with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each holder of the Secured Notes and the other
Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each holder of Priority Lien
Obligations, agrees that it will not (and waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any
proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability
of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations or any of the holders of the
Secured Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations in the Collateral, the allowability of the claims asserted with
respect to the Obligations under the Secured Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, or the Priority Lien
Obligations in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, or the provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement;
_provided that nothing in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any_
collateral agent or any holder of Priority Lien Obligations, holder of the Secured Notes, or holder of any other Parity
Lien Obligations to enforce the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, including the provisions thereof relating to the
priority of the Liens securing the respective obligations.

So long as neither the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations nor the discharge of obligations under the
Secured Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations has occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation
proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, any Collateral or proceeds thereof
received by any collateral agent or any holders of the Secured Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations or holders of
Priority Lien Obligations in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off) relating to the
Collateral or otherwise received in contravention of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be segregated and held
in trust and forthwith paid over to the appropriate collateral agent with a senior lien on such Collateral for the benefit
of the holders of the Secured Notes and the Parity Lien Obligations or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, as
the case may be, in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent
jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Each collateral agent will, under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, be authorized
by the other collateral agents to make any such endorsements as agent for the other collateral agents or any holders
of the Secured Notes or Parity Lien Obligations or holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be. This
authorization is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations and the
discharge of obligations under the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations.

_Collateral Access Rights_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL Collateral Agent will have access to and a rent
free right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral for the purpose of arranging for and effecting the sale or disposition of
Current Asset Collateral, including the production, completion, packaging and other preparation of such Current
Asset Collateral for sale or disposition for a period, after the commencement of an enforcement period, which begins
on the day that the ABL Collateral Agent provides the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent with the notice of
its election to request access to any mortgaged premises pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and ends on
the earliest of (i) the 180th day after the ABL Collateral Agent obtains the ability to use, take physical possession of,
remove or otherwise control the use or access to the Collateral located on such mortgaged premises following a
collateral enforcement action plus such number of days, if any, after the ABL Collateral Agent obtains access to

287


-----

such Collateral that it is stayed or otherwise prohibited by law or court order from exercising remedies with respect
to Collateral located on such mortgaged premises, (ii) the date on which all or substantially all of the Current Asset
Collateral located on such mortgaged premises is sold, collected or liquidated, (iii) the date on which the discharge
of the Priority Lien Obligations occurs and (iv) the date on which the event of default that was the subject of the
applicable Enforcement Notice relating to such enforcement period has been cured to the satisfaction of the ABL
Collateral Agent or the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, as applicable, or waived in writing in accordance
with the requirements of the New ABL Credit Agreement, New Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Secured
Indenture or documents governing other Parity Lien Indebtedness, as applicable.

Each Parity Lien Representative will grant (to the full extent of its rights and interests), without recourse,
representation or warranty, the ABL Collateral Agent and its agents, representatives and designees (a) a royalty free,
rent free non-exclusive license and lease to use all of the Fixed Asset Collateral constituting intellectual property, to
complete the sale of inventory and (b) a royalty free non-exclusive license (which will be binding on any successor
or assignee of the intellectual property) to use any and all intellectual property, in each case, at any time in
connection with its collateral enforcement action; provided, however, the royalty free, rent free non-exclusive
license and lease granted in clause (a) shall immediately expire upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of
all such inventory.

_Set Off and Tracing_

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, all funds
deposited in an account subject to a control agreement that constitute Current Asset Collateral and then applied to
the Priority Lien Obligations shall be treated as Current Asset Collateral and, unless the ABL Collateral Agent has
actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the ABL Collateral Agent through the Deposit
Accounts and Securities Accounts that are subject to such control agreements, are proceeds of or otherwise
constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Parity Lien Representatives and the holders of Parity Lien
Obligations; provided that after the issuance of an Enforcement Notice by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral
Agent, all identifiable proceeds of Fixed Asset Collateral shall be deemed Fixed Asset Collateral, whether or not
held in an account subject to a control agreement.

The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, any
proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited in an account subject to a deposit account control agreement or a
securities account control agreement, shall not (as between the Parity Lien Representatives, the ABL Collateral
Agent, and the respective secured parties) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the
relative priorities in the Collateral.

_Release of Liens_

If in connection with the exercise of the ABL Collateral Agent’s remedies in respect of any Collateral as
provided for in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the
holders of Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, then the
Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Notes and
the other Parity Lien Obligations, on the Current Asset Collateral sold or disposed of in connection with such
exercise, shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. Each Parity Lien Representative, for
itself or on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes and any other Parity Lien Obligations, promptly shall execute
and deliver to the ABL Collateral Agent or such Issuer or Guarantor such termination statements, releases and other
documents as the ABL Collateral Agent or such Issuer or Guarantor may request to effectively confirm such release.
The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the ABL
Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with an exercise of remedies with respect thereto by the
Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent. In addition, if in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or
other disposition of any Collateral permitted under the terms of the New ABL Credit Agreement, the New Term
Loan Credit Agreement and the Secured Indenture (other than in connection with the exercise of the ABL Collateral
Agent’s rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral as provided for in applicable provisions of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement), the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the holders of the Priority Lien
Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, in each case other than (A) in
connection with the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and during the continuance of

288


-----

an event of default under the Secured Indenture, then the Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself
or for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, on such Collateral shall
be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a
reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset
Collateral in connection with such a sale or other disposition in which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent
releases its Liens on such Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Amendments_

The Secured Indenture and the documents governing any other Parity Lien Obligation may be amended,
supplemented, amended and restated, replaced, refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance
with their terms and the obligations under the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations may be
refinanced, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority
Lien Obligations, all without affecting the lien priorities or other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement;
_provided, however, that any such refinancing shall comply with the applicable provision of the ABL Intercreditor_
Agreement and shall not contravene any provision of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Intercreditor
Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to any amendment of any ABL Documents or refinancing of
the Priority Lien Obligations.

_Certain Matters in Connection with Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings_

Until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall be subject
to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the ABL Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use of “Cash
Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) constituting Current Asset Collateral
on which the ABL Collateral Agent or any other creditor has a Lien or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to
obtain financing to be secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, whether from the holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations or any other Person under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of
any other applicable bankruptcy law (“DIP Financing”), then each Parity Lien Representatives, on behalf of itself
and the applicable holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that it will raise no
objection to such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing so long as such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing meets
the following requirements: (i) each Parity Lien Representative and the holders of the Secured Notes and the other
Parity Lien Obligations retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the Cash
Collateral use or the DIP Financing that are materially prejudicial to their interests in the Fixed Asset Collateral, and
(ii) the terms of the DIP Financing (A) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default
under the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order and (B) do not require that any Lien of the Parity
Lien Representatives on the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or pari passu with any Lien on the Fixed
Asset Collateral securing such DIP Financing. To the extent the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations are
subordinated to or pari passu with the Liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirements of clause
(ii) above, each Parity Lien Representative will subordinate its Liens in the Current Asset Collateral to (1) the Liens
thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto), (2) all adequate protection Liens thereon
granted to the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, and (3) to any “carve out” therefrom for professional and United
States trustee fees that has been agreed to by the ABL Collateral Agent, and will not request adequate protection or
any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the ABL Collateral Agent or to the extent
permitted by the applicable section of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement). The ABL Intercreditor Agreement
provides for a similar restriction on the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien
Obligations to object to a proposed DIP Financing that would be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset
Collateral or to the use of any Fixed Asset Collateral constituting cash collateral that has been approved by the
Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant
to the Security Documents and Secured Indenture to the extent the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is the
Notes Collateral Agent), provided that similar conditions with respect to the Current Asset Collateral and the holders
of Priority Lien Obligations would be satisfied in connection therewith.

Until the discharge of the Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, each Parity Lien Representative, on
behalf of itself and the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that none of them
shall seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or
liquidation proceeding in respect of the Current Asset Collateral, without the prior written consent of the ABL

289


-----

Collateral Agent, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in
any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Foreign Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement
provides for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien
Obligations to seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral.

Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes and the other
Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien
Obligations, acknowledges and agrees in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that the grants of Liens pursuant to the
ABL Security Documents and the Liens on Fixed Asset Collateral constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens,
and because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral (it being understood that in accordance
with the other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity
Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral and the holders of the Priority
Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Real Estate Assets), the Parity Lien Obligations are
fundamentally different from the Priority Lien Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in an insolvency or
liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the foregoing sentence, if it is
held that the claims of the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations and the holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes
of secured claims subject to the relative Lien priority set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to
such Collateral, it being understood that in accordance with the other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor
Agreement, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral),
then each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity
Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations,
acknowledge and agree that, subject to the Lien priority and application of proceeds provisions of the ABL
Intercreditor Agreement, all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured
claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that
the aggregate value of the Current Asset Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the
holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations), the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations
shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest,
fees, expenses and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, including
any additional interest payable pursuant to the New ABL Credit Agreement arising from or related to a default,
whether or not a claim therefor is allowed or allowable in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any
distribution is made from the Current Asset Collateral in respect of the claims held by the holders of the Secured
Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, with each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the
holders of the Secured Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the
ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, amounts otherwise
received or receivable by them from the Current Asset Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of
this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the holders of the Secured
Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations
will agree to a reciprocal provision with respect to distributions from the Fixed Asset Collateral and the potential
turn over thereof to the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent by the holders of Priority Lien Obligations.

Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Secured Notes and the other
Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien
Obligations, acknowledge and agree in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that no holder of Priority Lien Obligations
nor any holder of the Secured Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations (whether in the capacity of a secured
creditor or an unsecured creditor) shall propose, vote for, or otherwise support directly or indirectly any plan of
reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of
the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, if, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Issuer or
a Guarantor, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized
debtor are distributed or reinstated (in whole or in part) pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive
restructuring plan, both on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and on account of the Secured Notes and the
other Parity Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the Priority Lien
Obligations and on account of the Parity Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same property, the
provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to
such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations.

290


-----

Subject to certain designated provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, each Parity Lien
Representative agrees that it will consent, and will not object or oppose, or support any party in opposing, a motion
to dispose of any Current Asset Collateral free and clear of any Liens or other claims under Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law if the requisite holders of the
Priority Lien Obligations under the New ABL Credit Agreement have consented to such disposition of the Current
Asset Collateral, such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement,
the rights of the Parity Lien Representatives under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision
of any other applicable bankruptcy law (so long as the right of any holder of the Secured Notes or other Parity Lien
Obligation to offset its claim against the purchase price for any Current Asset Collateral exists only after the Priority
Lien Obligations have been paid in full in cash and/or in such other form of consideration as may be agreed to by the
holders of Priority Lien Obligations), and the terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for
the respective Liens to attach to the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral that is the subject of such disposition,
subject to the Lien priorities in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the other terms and conditions thereof. Each
Parity Lien Representative further agrees that it will not oppose, or support any party in opposing, the right of the
ABL Collateral Agent to credit bid under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any
other applicable bankruptcy law with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, subject to the provision of the
immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The ABL Collateral Agent and the
holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to reciprocal restrictions on their ability to object to, or credit bid
with respect to, any proposed sale of Fixed Asset Collateral.

_Certain Covenants with Respect to the Collateral_

The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents, which will contain provisions relating
to identification of the Collateral and the maintenance of perfected Liens thereon. The following is a summary of
some of the covenants and provisions set forth in the Security Documents and the Secured Indenture as they relate to
the Collateral.

_Maintenance of Collateral_

The Security Documents and/or the Secured Indenture, subject to certain exceptions, will provide that the
Issuer and the Guarantors shall maintain the Collateral in good, safe and insurable operating order, condition and
repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and to do all other acts as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
maintain and preserve the Collateral. The Security Documents and/or the Secured Indenture also will provide,
subject to certain exceptions, that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall pay all real estate and other taxes (except such
as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate negotiations or proceedings), and use commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all material permits and certain insurance coverages.

_After-Acquired Property_

Upon the acquisition by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors after the Acquisition Closing Date of any assets
(other than Excluded Assets), including, but not limited to, any real property that qualifies as Collateral or any
equipment or fixtures which constitute accretions, additions or technological upgrades to the equipment or fixtures
or any working capital assets that, in any such case, form part of the Collateral, the Issuer or such Guarantor shall
execute and deliver (i) with regard to real property that qualifies as Collateral, the items described under “—Real
Estate Mortgages and Filings” below within 90 days of the date of acquisition of the applicable asset (or such later
date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (ii)
with regard to any other after-acquired property to the extent required by the Secured Indenture and/or the Security
Documents, any information, documentation, financing statements or other certificates as may be necessary to vest
in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest, with the priority required by the Secured Indenture and
the Security Documents, subject only to Permitted Liens and the Perfection Exceptions, in such after-acquired
property and to have such after-acquired property added to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the
Secured Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such afteracquired property to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

_Further Assurances_

291


-----

To the extent required under the Secured Indenture or any of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the
Guarantors shall execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take
all further actions that may be required under applicable law, or that the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee may
reasonably request, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests
and Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Collateral. In addition, to the extent
required under the Secured Indenture or any of the Security Documents, from time to time, the Issuer and the
Guarantors will reasonably promptly secure the obligations under the Secured Indenture and Security Documents by
pledging or creating, or causing to be pledged or created, perfected security interests and Liens with respect to the
Collateral to the extent required by the Secured Indenture and/or the Security Documents.

_Impairment of Security Interest_

Neither Parent nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will (i) take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take,
any action which would materially adversely affect or impair the Liens in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and
the holders of Secured Notes with respect to the Collateral unless such action or failure to take action is otherwise
permitted by the Secured Indenture or the Security Documents or (ii) grant any Person, or permit any Person to
retain (other than the Notes Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent or the Term Loan Collateral Agent), any
Liens on the Collateral, other than Permitted Liens. The Issuer and each Guarantor will, at its sole cost and expense,
execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments as necessary, or as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral
Agent reasonably requests, to more fully or accurately describe the assets and property intended to be Collateral or
the Obligations intended to be secured by the Security Documents.

_Real Estate Mortgages and Filings_

With respect to any fee interest in any Premises owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor on the Acquisition
Closing Date or acquired by the Issuer or a Guarantor after the Acquisition Closing Date that forms a part of the
Collateral (but specifically excluding Excluded Assets), within 90 days of the Acquisition Closing Date or the date
of acquisition, as applicable (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the
New Term Loan Credit Agreement) (in each case solely to the extent, and substantially in the form, delivered to the
Term Loan Collateral Agent, but no greater scope):

(1) the Issuer or such Guarantor shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent, as mortgagee or
beneficiary, as applicable, for the ratable benefit of itself, the Trustee and the holders, fully
executed counterparts of mortgages, debentures, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt or other
similar security instruments (each, a “Mortgage”) in accordance with the requirements of the
Secured Indenture and/or the Security Documents, duly executed and acknowledged by the Issuer
or such Guarantor, and otherwise in form for recording in the recording office of each applicable
political subdivision where the Premises to be encumbered thereby is situated, together with such
certificates, affidavits, questionnaires or returns as shall be reasonably required in connection with
the recording or filing thereof and evidence of the completion (or satisfactory arrangements for the
completion) of all recordings and filings of such Mortgage (and payment of any taxes or fees in
connection therewith), together with any fixture filings, as may be necessary to create a valid,
perfected Lien, with the priority required by the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents,
subject to Permitted Liens, against the Premises purported to be covered thereby; provided,
however, to the extent any such Mortgage is to be filed in a jurisdiction that charges mortgage,
intangibles or similar taxes in connection with the recording thereof, the amount to be secured by
such Mortgage shall not be more than the Issuer’s reasonable estimate of the fair market value of
such property;

(2) the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received mortgagee’s title insurance policies (or a binding
pro forma title insurance policy or marked-up unconditional binder of title insurance) in favor of
the Notes Collateral Agent, and its successors and/or assigns, in the form necessary, with respect
to the Premises purported to be covered by the applicable Mortgages, which shall insure that the
Mortgages constitute a valid Lien on the applicable Premises, with the priority required by the
Secured Indenture and the Security Documents, free and clear of all Liens, defects and
encumbrances, other than Permitted Liens. All such title policies shall be in amounts equal to the

292


-----

estimated fair market value of the Premises covered thereby as reasonably estimated by the Issuer
or any Guarantor, and such policies shall also include, to the extent available, all such
endorsements as shall be reasonably required in transactions of similar size and purpose to the
extent available at commercially reasonable rates and shall be accompanied by evidence of the
payment in full by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor of all premiums thereon (or that
satisfactory arrangements for such payment have been made) and that all charges for mortgage
recording taxes, filing and recording fees and all related expenses, if any, have been paid;

(3) if requested by the Term Loan Collateral Agent under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, the
Notes Collateral Agent shall have received, and the title insurance company issuing the policy
referred to in clause (2) above (the “Title Insurance Company”) shall have received an ALTA
survey or other survey of the sites of the Premises in a manner customary for the type of real
property subject to such survey, dated as of a date that is reasonably satisfactory to the Title
Insurance Company by an independent professional licensed land surveyor reasonably satisfactory
to the Title Insurance Company or, in lieu thereof, existing surveys, together with any affidavits or
certificates required by the Title Insurance Company as shall be sufficient to enable the Title
Insurance Company to remove any standard survey exceptions from the applicable title insurance
policy and issue customary survey-dependent endorsements to the applicable title insurance
policy; and

(4) the Issuer or the Guarantors shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent customary local counsel
opinions.

_Foreclosure_

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, but subject in all cases to the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreements, the Security Documents will provide for (among other available remedies) the sale
of, or other realization upon, the applicable Collateral by the Notes Collateral Agent and the distribution, after
payment of the outstanding fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent (including, but not
limited to, attorney’s fees and expenses), of the net proceeds of any such sale to the holders of the Secured Notes
and other Parity Lien Indebtedness on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior Liens on the Collateral and the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreements. In the event of realization on the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the
Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy in full the Issuer’s obligations under the Secured Notes.

_Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_

In addition to the limitations described above, the right of the Notes Collateral Agent to obtain possession,
exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or
at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy or other insolvency laws if the Issuer or any Guarantor were to
have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar law or statute under debtor relief laws in any
applicable jurisdiction) prior to the Notes Collateral Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or
disposed of the Collateral. For example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code,
creditors, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, are prohibited by the automatic stay from taking various actions in
furtherance of debt collection, including obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or
from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, in each case without prior bankruptcy
court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code generally
permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral) owned as of the date of the
bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is
in default under the applicable debt instruments, subject to certain protections afforded to a secured creditor
(including the right to receive “adequate protection”).

In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition
of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Secured Notes
could be made following the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding (or the length of any delay
in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral,
the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any point thereafter or whether or to what

293


-----

extent holders of the Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the
Collateral through adequate protection or otherwise.

Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect
to any Priority Lien Obligations, to the extent senior to the obligations in respect of the Secured Notes or Parity Lien
Indebtedness (including the obligations under the New ABL Credit Agreement on the Current Asset Collateral)) is
not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Secured Notes, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Secured Notes
would be “undersecured” and the holders of the Secured Notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the
value of the Collateral and would hold unsecured claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the
payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s
bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral on account of which payment or
accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees are sought (as well as any obligations secured by a senior
lien on such Collateral).

In addition, the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee appointed therefor) or creditors of the Issuer or any
Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent, or the incurrence of
obligations in respect of the Secured Notes, as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, preference or otherwise under
the Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law or any other applicable bankruptcy law. If such a challenge were
successful, the Liens may be avoided, leaving the holders of the Secured Notes with unsecured claims (or potentially
no claims at all) against the applicable entities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or the
guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) and, if that occurs, you may
not receive any payments on the Notes.”

_Information Regarding Collateral_

The Issuer will furnish to the Notes Collateral Agent, with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, written
notice of any change in such Person’s (1) legal name, (2) jurisdiction of organization or formation, or (3) identity or
corporate structure within 30 days of such change (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have
agreed to under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement with respect to Fixed Asset Collateral, or the ABL Collateral
Agent may have agreed to under the New ABL Credit Agreement with respect to Current Asset Collateral).
Promptly upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will make all filings under the
UCC and any other applicable laws that are required by the Secured Indenture and/or the Security Documents in
order for the Collateral to be made subject to the Lien of the Notes Collateral Agent under the Secured Indenture
and/or the Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required by the Secured Indenture or any of the
Security Documents, and shall take all necessary action so that such Lien is perfected with the same priority as
immediately prior to such change to the extent required by the Secured Indenture and/or the Security Documents.

The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate attaching
supplemental schedules required under the Security Documents to the extent required under and at the same time as
similar supplemental schedules are delivered to the Term Loan Collateral Agent.

_Refinancings of the New Credit Agreements and the Secured Notes_

The obligations under the New Credit Agreements and the obligations under the Secured Indenture and the
Secured Notes may be refinanced or replaced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of
the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any Secured
Notes (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the refinancing transaction under a New Credit
Agreement or any security document related thereto or under the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents),
all without affecting the Lien priorities provided for in the Security Documents; provided, however, that the lenders
providing or holders of any such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (or an authorized agent or trustee on their
behalf) bind themselves in writing to the terms of the applicable Intercreditor Agreements pursuant to a written
agreement (including amendments or supplements to the applicable Intercreditor Agreements) as required by the
Intercreditor Agreements.

294


-----

In addition, if at any time in connection with or after the discharge of Term Loan Obligations or Priority
Lien Obligations the Issuer enters into any (i) replacement of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement secured by all
or a portion of the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis or all or a portion of the Current Asset
Collateral on a second-priority Lien basis, respectively, or (ii) any replacement of the New ABL Credit Agreement
secured by all or a portion of the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis or all or a portion of the Fixed
Asset Collateral on a second-priority Lien basis, respectively (and in each case, subject to Permitted Liens), then
such prior discharge of Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, shall automatically
be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the Intercreditor Agreements, the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement, the New ABL Credit Agreement, the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents, and the
Obligations under such replacement New Term Loan Credit Agreement or replacement New ABL Credit Agreement
shall automatically be treated as Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, for all
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreements, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of the
Fixed Asset Collateral or Current Asset Collateral (or, in each case, such portion thereof) set forth therein.
Notwithstanding any replacement or refinancing of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or the New ABL Credit
Agreement or the entering into of a new New Term Loan Credit Agreement or New ABL Credit Agreement
(whether or not such replacement or refinancing of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or the New ABL Credit
Agreement, as applicable, immediately follows any prior discharge of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement or
New ABL Credit Agreement previously in existence), the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees shall be,
in addition to being secured by the other Collateral, secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral or the Current Asset
Collateral, as applicable (it being understood that during the period the New Term Loan Credit Agreement is not in
existence that the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees will continue to be secured by a first-priority
Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Fixed Asset Collateral and a second-priority Lien, subject to Permitted
Liens, on all of the Current Asset Collateral, and during the period the New ABL Credit Agreement is not in
existence that the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees will be secured by a first-priority Lien, subject to
Permitted Liens, on all of the Current Asset Collateral and will continue to be secured by a first-priority Lien,
subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Fixed Asset Collateral).

In connection with any refinancing or replacement contemplated by the foregoing paragraphs, the
Intercreditor Agreements may be amended at the request and sole expense of the Issuer, and without the consent of
the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent (if applicable), the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder
of any Secured Notes, (a) to add parties (or any authorized agent or trustee therefor) providing any such refinancing
or replacement indebtedness in compliance with the New Credit Agreements and the Secured Indenture and (b) to
establish that Liens on any Collateral securing such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness shall have the same
priority (or junior priority) or, if the New Credit Agreements and the Secured Indenture so permit, senior priority, as
the Liens on any Collateral securing the Indebtedness being refinanced or replaced, all on the terms provided for in
the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents immediately prior to such refinancing or replacement.

**Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption**

This offering is expected to be consummated on     , 2021, which may be prior to the consummation of
the Acquisition. If this offering does not close prior to consummation of the Acquisition, concurrently with the
closing of the offering of the Secured Notes on the Issue Date, the Issuer will enter into an Escrow Agreement with
the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited): (i) an amount
in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Dollar Secured Notes into the Dollar Escrow Account
(together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively, the “Dollar Escrowed Funds”); and (ii) an
amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Euro Secured Notes into the Euro Escrow Account
(together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively, the “Euro Escrowed Funds” and, together
with the Dollar Escrowed Funds, the “Escrowed Funds”). The Issuer will grant the Trustee, (i) for the benefit of
itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Dollar Secured Notes, a first-priority security interest in the Dollar
Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations under the Dollar Secured Notes
and (ii) for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Euro Secured Notes, a first-priority security
interest in the Euro Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations under the
Euro Secured Notes, in each case, pending disbursement as described below.

Upon a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Issuer will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest
(and accretion, if any) owing to the holders of each Series of Secured Notes to, but not including, the Special

295


-----

Mandatory Redemption Date, plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. Prior to the
Acquisition, the Issuer will have very limited assets other than the Escrowed Funds and the escrowed proceeds of
the offering of the Unsecured Notes and no operations. The Escrowed Funds will be limited to the gross proceeds
from this offering of the Secured Notes. As a result, an affiliate of Platinum will issue an irrevocable equity
commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) to the Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent
and the holders of the Secured Notes, that will require such affiliate of Platinum, (x) in the event that any interest is
payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined
below), to transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the Dollar Secured Notes, or euros, in the case of
the Euro Secured Notes, to the Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders
of such Secured Notes and (y) upon receipt of a notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption, to transfer to the Issuer
an amount necessary to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Secured Notes, plus certain fees and
expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our
Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the
occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you
may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.”

The Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will release the
Escrowed Funds (the “Escrow Release”) to the Issuer (the date of such Escrow Release being referred to as the
“Acquisition Closing Date”) upon the presentation by the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow
Agent and the Trustee on or prior to July 11, 2022 (the “Outside Date”), certifying that (a) the Acquisition will be
consummated in accordance in all material respects with the Acquisition Agreement (without waiver or amendment
of, or consent under, the Acquisition Agreement that is, in the aggregate when taken as a whole, in the reasonable
opinion of the Issuer, materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Secured Notes; provided that, (1) no
reduction in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of
the Secured Notes, (2) no increase in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the
interests of the holders of the Secured Notes if such increase is not funded with additional Indebtedness, and (3) no
modification to the acquisition consideration as a result of any purchase price adjustment or working capital
adjustment expressly contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement as of the date hereof shall constitute a reduction
or increase in the acquisition consideration) and (b) the Guarantors will (i) become parties to the Indenture by means
of a supplemental indenture effective upon the date of the Escrow Release and (ii) will become parties to the
Purchase Agreement by means of a joinder agreement (the “Escrow Release Conditions”).

In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time
prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in our good faith judgment, to be incapable of
being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, (any such event being a
“Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Issuer will redeem each Series of Secured Notes (the “Special Mandatory
_Redemption”) no later than three business days following the Mandatory Redemption Event (or otherwise in_
accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable) (the “Special
_Mandatory Redemption Date”) at the Special Mandatory Redemption Price._

As long as Dollar Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the
Escrow Agent at the Issuer’s written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written
instruction, the Dollar Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested
in cash. As long as Euro Escrowed Funds are deposited with the Escrow Agent, they will be invested by the Escrow
Agent at the Issuer’s written instruction in Eligible Escrow Investments. In the absence of written instruction, the
Euro Escrowed Funds shall be invested as provided in the Escrow Agreement or remain uninvested in cash.

“Eligible Escrow Investments” means any of the following securities: (1) investment in obligations issued
or directly and fully guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
government, the U.K. government or any agency or instrumentality of the U.K. government, any constituent nation
of the U.K. or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or any member of the European Union or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the Outside Date, (2) demand deposits, including
interest bearing money market accounts, time deposits, trust funds, trust accounts, overnight bank deposits, interestbearing deposits, and certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances of depository institutions in each case maturing

296


-----

no later than the Outside Date, (3) investments in commercial paper maturing no later than the Outside Date and
having, at the date of acquisition, a credit rating no lower than A-1 from S&P, P-1 from Moody’s, or F-1 from Fitch,
(4) repurchase obligations maturing no later than the Outside Date entered into with a nationally recognized brokerdealer, with respect to which the purchased securities are obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government
or any agency thereof, which repurchase obligations shall be entered into pursuant to written agreements and (5)
investments in money market mutual funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted thereby from
S&P or Moody’s, including those for which the Trustee or an affiliate receives and retains a fee for services
provided to the fund, whether as a custodian, transfer agent, investment advisor or otherwise.

If the Escrow Agent (i) has not received an Officer’s Certificate at or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City
time) on the Outside Date or (ii) has received an escrow termination notice from the Issuer prior to the Outside Date,
then the Escrow Agent promptly after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Outside Date or the date on which it
has received an escrow termination notice (as applicable) shall liquidate the Escrowed Funds and, on or prior to the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date, release (x) an amount of Escrowed Funds to the Trustee equal to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Price and (y) after payment of any amounts due and owing to the Trustee or the Escrow
Agent, any remaining amount of Escrowed Funds to the Issuer.

No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the
Escrowed Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Secured Notes
without the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes
outstanding. For purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes that have consented to or
voted in favor of any such waiver or modification, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro
Secured Notes shall be calculated by the Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen
(or such other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York
City time) on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such waiver or modification. To the extent such
provisions relate to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Secured Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, no
provisions of the Secured Indenture may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of
the Secured Notes without the written consent of all holders of the Secured Notes. By its acceptance of a Secured
Note, each holder shall be deemed to have authorized and directed the Trustee to enter into and perform its
obligations, if any, under the Escrow Agreement.

**Activities Prior to the Escrow Release**

The Issuer is a limited purpose entity. Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer’s primary activities
will be restricted to issuing the Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes, issuing capital stock to, and receiving
capital contributions from direct and indirect parent companies of the Issuer, performing its obligations in respect of
the Secured Notes under the Secured Indenture and the Escrow Agreement and performing its obligations in respect
of the Unsecured Notes under the Unsecured Indenture and the Unsecured Notes escrow agreement, performing any
obligations under the Acquisition Agreement, consummating the Escrow Release and redeeming the Secured Notes
and the Unsecured Notes, if applicable, and conducting such other activities as are necessary, advisable or
appropriate to carry out the activities described above or related to the Transactions. Prior to the Acquisition Closing
Date, the Issuer will not own, hold or otherwise have any interest in any assets other than the Escrow Accounts and
the escrow accounts holding the proceeds of the Unsecured Notes, cash and Cash Equivalents and its rights under
the Acquisition Agreement pursuant to which the Acquisition is to be consummated (if any), the Secured Notes and
the Secured Indenture and the Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Indenture.

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, the Issuer shall not engage in any activity or enter into any
transaction or agreement (including, without limitation, making any restricted payment, incurring any debt (except
the Secured Notes and the Unsecured Notes), incurring any Liens except in favor of the Escrow Agent, Trustee, the
holders of the Secured Notes and/or the holders of the Unsecured Notes, entering into any merger, consolidation or
sale of all or substantially all of its assets or engaging in any transaction with its Affiliates) except in the ordinary
course of business or as necessary, advisable or appropriate to effectuate the Acquisition and the Transactions
substantially in accordance with the description of the Transactions set forth in this offering memorandum, together
with such amendments, modifications and waivers that are not, individually or in the aggregate, materially adverse
(after giving effect to the consummation of the Acquisition) to the holders of the Secured Notes.

297


-----

Prior to the Acquisition Closing Date, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) will
be parties to the Secured Indenture and will not be controlled by the Issuer; accordingly, prior to the Acquisition
Closing Date, none of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Issuer) will be subject to the restrictions,
agreements or covenants in the Secured Indenture or the Escrow Agreement.

**Optional Redemption**

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem up to (a) 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Secured Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any
Additional Dollar Secured Notes) issued under the Secured Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the
principal amount of Dollar Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Dollar Secured
Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Dollar Secured
Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the
redemption date), with the cash proceeds of any Equity Offering; provided that: (1) at least the lesser of (a) 50% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Secured Notes (including any Additional Dollar Secured Notes) then
outstanding or (b) $      million aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Secured Notes (including any
Additional Dollar Secured Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption
(except to the extent otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture); and
(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering; and (b) 40% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Euro Secured Notes (calculated after giving effect to the issuance of any
Additional Euro Secured Notes) issued under the Secured Indenture at a redemption price equal to   % of the
principal amount of Euro Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Euro Secured
Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption (subject to the right of holders of Euro Secured Notes
on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption
date), with the cash proceeds of any Equity Offering; provided that: (1) at least the lesser of (a) 50% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Euro Secured Notes (including any Additional Euro Secured Notes) then outstanding or (b)
€      million aggregate principal amount of the Euro Secured Notes (including any Additional Euro Secured
Notes) remains outstanding immediately after the occurrence of each such redemption (except to the extent
otherwise repurchased or redeemed in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture); and (2) the redemption
occurs within 180 days of the date of the closing of such Equity Offering.

At any time prior to     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of
either Series of Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the applicable Series
of Secured Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium as of the date of the redemption notice, and accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, on the Secured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption, subject to the
rights of holders of the applicable Series of Secured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an
interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date.

At any time, in connection with any offer to purchase either Series of Secured Notes (including pursuant to
a Change of Control Offer, Alternate Offer (as defined below) or Asset Sale Offer (as defined below)), if holders of
at least 90% in aggregate principal amount of such Series of Secured Notes outstanding tender such Secured Notes
in such offer, the Issuer or such other Person, upon notice given not more than 60 days following such purchase
pursuant to such offer, may redeem all of the remaining Secured Notes of such Series at a price in cash equal to the
price offered to each holder in such prior offer, plus, to the extent not included in the prior offer payment, accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, on the Secured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the date of redemption, subject to
the rights of holders of Secured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date
occurring on or prior to the redemption date. In determining whether the holders of at least 90% in aggregate
principal amount of the outstanding Secured Notes of a Series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
Secured Notes in an offer, Secured Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Issuer or by funds controlled or managed by
any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such
offer.

Prior to the third anniversary of the Issue Date, the Issuer may redeem during each calendar year
commencing with the calendar year in which the Issue Date occurs up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
each Series of Secured Notes, including any Additional Secured Notes, at its option, from time to time at a
redemption price equal to 103% of the aggregate principal amount of such Series of Secured Notes redeemed, plus

298


-----

accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to (but not including) the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of
Secured Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling on or
prior to the redemption date).

Except pursuant to the preceding paragraphs, the Secured Notes will not be redeemable at the Issuer’s
option prior to     , 2024.

On or after     , 2024, the Issuer may on any one or more occasions redeem all or a portion of either
Series of Secured Notes at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount of the applicable
Series of Secured Notes to be redeemed) set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such Series of
Secured Notes redeemed, to (but not including) the applicable date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month
period beginning on      of the years indicated below, subject to the rights of holders of Secured Notes on a
relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the redemption date:

**Year** **Dollar Secured** **Euro Secured**

**Notes** **Notes**
**Percentage** **Percentage**

2024 ............................................... % %
2025 ............................................... % %
2026 and thereafter ........................ % %

Any redemption of Secured Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be performed by another Person and be
subject to one or more conditions precedent. In addition, if any redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more
conditions precedent, the related notice of redemption shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date
may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole
discretion), or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be modified or rescinded in the event that any or
all such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by the Issuer in its sole discretion) by the redemption
date, or by the redemption date so delayed (which may exceed 60 days from the date of the redemption notice in
such case). Such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been met by providing
notice to the noteholders.

Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the applicable redemption date (to the extent such
redemption date occurs and as such date may be extended or delayed). Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of
the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Secured Notes or portions thereof called for redemption on
the applicable redemption date (whether or not a business day).


The Issuer or its Affiliates may at any time and from time to time purchase Secured Notes. Any such
purchases may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions with third parties or pursuant to
one or more tender or exchange offers or otherwise, upon such terms and at such prices as well as with such
consideration as the Issuer or any such Affiliates may determine. The amount of such purchases may be material. To
the extent Secured Notes are purchased or otherwise acquired by the Issuer, such Secured Notes may be cancelled
and all obligations thereunder terminated.

**Mandatory Redemption**

Except as set forth under the heading “—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption,” the Issuer
will not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Secured Notes.

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of the Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Secured Notes
for redemption pro rata, by lot or by such method as it shall deem fair and appropriate. If the Secured Notes are
represented by global notes, interests in such global notes will be selected for redemption in accordance with the
applicable procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable; provided that (i) no Dollar Secured

299


-----

Notes in denominations of $200,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part and (ii) no Euro Secured Notes in
denominations of €100,000 or less can be redeemed or purchased in part.

Notices of redemption will be mailed by first class mail (or with respect to global notes, to the extent
permitted or required by the procedures or regulations of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, sent
electronically) at least ten but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each holder of Secured Notes to
be redeemed at its registered address, except that redemption notices may be mailed or sent more than 60 days prior
to a redemption date if (a) the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Secured Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Secured Indenture or (b) in the case of a redemption that is subject to one or more conditions
precedent, the date of redemption is extended as permitted in the Secured Indenture.

If any Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Secured
Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Secured Note that is to be redeemed. A new Secured Note
in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Secured Note will be issued in the name of the
holder of Secured Notes upon cancellation of the original Secured Note (or transferred by book entry).

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem a Series of Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the holders of such Series of Secured Notes (which notice will be
irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the rights of holders of such
Series of Secured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest on an interest payment date occurring on or
prior to the redemption date) and all Additional Amounts, as defined below under “—Withholding Taxes,” if any,
then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the
Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or other administrative
guidance promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting
taxation; or

(2) any change in, or amendment to, an official application, administration or written interpretation of
such laws, treaties, regulations, or other official administrative guidance (including by reason of a
holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published
administrative practice of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and
(2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer or any Guarantor is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of such Series of Secured
Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such Series of Secured Notes (but, in the case
of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by another Guarantor who can
make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts or by the Issuer), and such obligation cannot
be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
appointment of a new paying agent where this would be reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must be publicly
announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became
a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, after such later date). The foregoing provisions shall
apply (a) to a Guarantor only after such time as such Guarantor is obligated to make at least one payment on such
Series of Secured Notes and (b) mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a
party to the Secured Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor Person
becomes a party to such Series of Secured Notes (or, if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a later date, after such later date).

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be distributed in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional
Amounts. Prior to the distribution of any notice of redemption of Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer
will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting

300


-----

forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right to so redeem have been satisfied and that
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the relevant Payor taking reasonable measures
available to it and (b) a written opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing qualified under the
laws of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and satisfactory to the Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld) to the effect that the Payor has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a
Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as
sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which
event it will be conclusive and binding on the holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”) in respect of the
Secured Notes or with respect to any Secured Notes Guarantee thereof, as applicable, will be made free and clear of
and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of such
Taxes is then required by law or by the relevant taxing authority’s interpretation or administration thereof. If any
deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Secured Note or Secured Notes
Guarantee thereof is made or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein
having the power to tax (including the jurisdiction of the paying agent); or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is at any relevant time incorporated or organized, engaged
in business for tax purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any
political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax (each of
clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required by law or the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’s interpretation or administration
thereof to be made by any applicable withholding agent in respect of any payments made by or on behalf of the
Payor with respect to any Secured Note or any Secured Notes Guarantee thereof, including (without limitation)
payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such
payments) such additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts
received by each beneficial owner in respect of such payments (i.e., the person treated as the owner of such
payments for purposes of the applicable Tax), after such withholding or deduction (including any such withholding
or deduction in respect of such Additional Amounts), will equal the amounts which would have been received by
such beneficial owner in respect of such payments on any such Secured Note or Secured Notes Guarantee thereof in
the absence of such withholding or deduction; provided, however, that (A) if a beneficial owner is not the holder of
the Notes, the Additional Amounts payable to such beneficial owner in respect of any Tax shall not exceed the
Additional Amounts that would have been payable to such beneficial owner in respect of such Tax had the
beneficial owner been the holder and (B) no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes would not have been so imposed, deducted or withheld but for
the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant holder or beneficial owner
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member, partner or shareholder of, or possessor of
power over the relevant holder or beneficial owner, if the relevant holder or beneficial owner is an
estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being or having been resident for tax purposes,
or being or having been a citizen or domiciliary or resident or national of, or carrying on a
business or maintaining a permanent establishment in or having a place of management in, or
being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any
connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or disposition of such Secured Note or
the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Secured Note, the
Secured Indenture or a Secured Notes Guarantee thereof;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed, deducted or withheld by reason of the failure by
the holder or the beneficial owner of the Secured Note to comply with a reasonable written request
of the Payor addressed to the holder or beneficial owner, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days

301


-----

before any such withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information,
documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the holder or such
beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other certification,
information or reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a law, statute,
treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition
to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, all or part of such Tax; provided that, in each case,
such holder or beneficial owner is legally eligible for the Tax exemption or reduction in question;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Secured Note
for payment (where Secured Notes are in definitive form and presentation is required) more than
30 days after the later of the applicable payment date or the date the relevant payment is first made
available for payment to the holder (except to the extent that the holder would have been entitled
to Additional Amounts had the Secured Note been presented on the last day of such 30 day
period);

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding in respect of a payment
with respect to the Secured Notes or with respect to any Secured Notes Guarantee thereof;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal property or similar Taxes;

(6) any Taxes imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code as
of the Issue Date (and any amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not
materially more onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations thereunder or official
interpretations thereof, any agreements entered into pursuant to current Section 1471(b)(1) of the
Code (or any amended or successor version described above) and any intergovernmental
agreement, treaty or convention among governmental authorities (or related laws, rules or official
administrative guidance) implementing such Sections of the Code;

(7) (A) in the case of the Dollar Secured Notes, any U.S. federal withholding Taxes and (B) in the
case of the Euro Secured Notes, any U.S. federal withholding Taxes, to the extent such Taxes are
imposed or withheld by reason of the holder (y) being a controlled foreign corporation within the
meaning of Section 957(a) of the Code related within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the
Code to the Issuer or a Guarantor, or (z) being an actual or constructive owner of 10 percent or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Issuer or a Guarantor
entitled to vote; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

The Payor, if it is the applicable withholding agent, will (i) make any required withholding or deduction
and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax Authority in accordance with applicable law.
In such event, the Payor will provide certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes, or if such tax receipts are not
available, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the
Trustee (with a copy to the paying agent). Such copies shall be made available to the holders upon reasonable
request and will be made available at the offices of the paying agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment made on any Secured
Note or any Secured Notes Guarantee thereof, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Secured Notes Trustee and the paying agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable
the paying agent to pay Additional Amounts on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional
Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such
Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable thereafter). The Secured Notes Trustee and the paying agent shall be
entitled to rely solely, without further enquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments
are necessary.

302


-----

Wherever in the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes or this “Description of Secured Notes” there is
mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal;

(2) redemption prices or purchase prices in connection with a redemption or purchase of the Secured
Notes;

(3) interest; or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Secured Notes or any Secured Notes
Guarantee thereof,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such
context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay each applicable holder for any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or
documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, additions to tax or penalties with
respect thereto) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related
interest, additions to tax or penalties with respect thereto) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the
execution, issuance, delivery, registration, enforcement of, or receipt of payments in respect of any Secured Notes,
any Secured Notes Guarantee thereof, the Secured Indenture, or any other document or instrument in relation thereto
(limited, solely to the extent of such taxes or similar charges or levies that arise from the receipt of any payments of
principal or interest on the Secured Notes, to any such taxes or similar charges or levies that are not excluded under
clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7)).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Secured Indenture,
any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner, and will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor to any Payor and to
any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is incorporated or organized, engaged in business for tax purposes
or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect
to the Secured Notes (or any Secured Notes Guarantee thereof) is made by or on behalf of such Person, or, in each
case, any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein.

**Issuance in euro; payment on the Euro Secured Notes**

Initial holders of the Euro Secured Notes will be required to pay for the Euro Secured Notes in euro, and all
payments of principal of, premium, if any, and interest, will be payable in euro; provided, that if on or after the Issue
Date, (i) the euro is unavailable to the Issuer due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances
beyond its control or (ii) the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary
Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or
within the international banking community (clauses (i) and (ii), each a “Euro Unavailability Event”), then all
payments in respect of the Euro Secured Notes will be made in U.S. dollars until the end of such Euro Unavailability
Event. The amount payable on any date in euro will be converted into U.S. dollars at the rate mandated by the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board as of the close of business on the second business day prior to the relevant payment date or,
in the event the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has not mandated a rate of conversion, on the basis of the most recent
U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate published in The Wall Street Journal (or, if not published by the Wall Street Journal,
other national news source) on or prior to the second business day prior to the relevant payment date. Any payment
in respect of the Euro Secured Notes so made in U.S. dollars during the continuance of a Euro Unavailability Event
will not constitute a Default or Event of Default under the Euro Secured Notes or the Secured Indenture. In no event
shall the Trustee or paying agents be responsible for monitoring any exchange rates or effecting any conversions.

**Repurchase at the Option of Holders**

**_Change of Control_**

Upon the occurrence after the Acquisition Closing Date of a Change of Control, each holder of Secured
Notes will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all or any portion (equal to a minimum denomination of
$200,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Dollar Secured Notes, or equal to a
minimum denomination of €100,000 or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro
Secured Notes) of that holder’s Secured Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer on the terms set forth in the
Secured Indenture; provided that any unpurchased portion of a Secured Note must be in a minimum denomination of
(i) $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Secured Notes and (ii) €100,000 in the case of the Euro Secured Notes. In the
Change of Control Offer, the Issuer will offer a payment (the “Change of Control Payment”) in cash equal to 101%
of the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the
Secured Notes repurchased to (but not including) the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment Date”),
subject to the rights of holders of Secured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest
payment date occurring on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date. Prior to or within 30 days following any
Change of Control, except to the extent the Issuer has delivered notice to the Trustee of its intention to redeem
Secured Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will mail (or with respect to global
notes to the extent permitted or required by the procedures or regulations of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, send electronically) a notice to each holder (a “Change of Control Offer”), with a copy to the Trustee,
describing the transaction or transactions that constitute, or are expected to constitute, the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase Secured Notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in the notice, which date
will be no earlier than ten days and no later than 90 days (unless delivered in advance of the occurrence of such
Change of Control) from the date such notice is mailed or sent, pursuant to the procedures required by the Secured
Indenture and described in such notice. If such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control,
such notice shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned upon the occurrence of such Change of
Control and shall describe such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s sole discretion, the
Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 90 days after the notice is
mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that
such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall
not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so
delayed. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
the repurchase of the Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any
securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuer
will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Secured Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Secured Notes or portions of Secured Notes properly tendered pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Secured Notes or portions of Secured Notes properly tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Secured Notes properly accepted together with
an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes or portions of
Secured Notes being purchased by the Issuer.

The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Secured Notes properly tendered the Change of
Control Payment for such Secured Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be
transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the
Secured Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon
as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

304


-----

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Secured Indenture will not contain
provisions that permit the holders of the Secured Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Secured
Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third
party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and
purchases all Secured Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) in
connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) or a third
party has made an offer to purchase at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the
Secured Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Secured Notes validly
tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Secured Notes
properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer, or (3) notice of redemption has been given to
the Trustee pursuant to the Secured Indenture as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until
there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control and/or
conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease,
transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Parent and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Secured Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its
Secured Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of
Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks
Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of
control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of
our assets.”

The occurrence of a Change of Control under the Secured Indenture may also constitute a default under the
New Credit Agreements that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. As a result,
following a Change of Control, the Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Secured Notes unless all indebtedness
outstanding under the New Credit Agreements is first repaid and any other Indebtedness that contains similar
provisions is repaid, or we obtain a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness to provide the Issuer with
sufficient cash to repurchase the Secured Notes. In addition, the Unsecured Notes will have similar requirements
regarding the Issuer’s obligation to offer to purchase such Unsecured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of
Control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase
the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

The Issuer’s obligation to make a Change of Control Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with
the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Secured Notes) prior to the
occurrence of such Change of Control.

**_Asset Sales_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale unless:

(1) Parent (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration (including by way
of relief from, or by any other person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time
of the Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed of; and

(2) except in the case of a Permitted Asset Swap, in the case of any single transaction that involves
assets having a fair market value of more than the greater of (x) $45.0 million and (y) 7.5% of Consolidated
EBITDA, at least 75% of the consideration received in the Asset Sale by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary is in

305


-----

the form of cash or Cash Equivalents. For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(a) any liabilities (as shown on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance
sheet or in the footnotes thereto for which internal financial statements are available) of Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have
been reflected on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet (or in the footnotes thereto) (other than
liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Secured Notes or any Secured Note Guarantee)) that are
assumed by the transferee with respect to the applicable disposition and for which Parent and the Restricted
Subsidiaries shall have been validly released by all applicable creditors in writing,

(b) any securities, notes, other obligations or assets received by Parent or such Restricted
Subsidiary from such transferee that are convertible by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash
Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the applicable Asset Sale;

(c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary
in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Non-cash
Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x)
$180.0 million and (y) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary that is
not Subordinated Indebtedness received from such transferee; and

(e) accounts receivable of a business retained by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the
case may be, following the sale of such business; provided that such accounts receivable (1) are not past due more
than 90 days and (2) do not have a payment date greater than 120 days from the date of the invoices creating such
accounts receivable;

(3) to the extent that any consideration received by Parent (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
may be) in such Asset Sale constitutes property or other assets that are of a type or class that constitutes Fixed Asset
Collateral, such property or other assets are added to the Fixed Asset Collateral securing the Secured Notes in the
manner and to the extent required by the Secured Indenture or any of the Security Documents; and

(4) Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary has complied with the applicable provisions of the Secured
Indenture and the Security Documents.

Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds at its option:

(1) (i) to repay Priority Lien Obligations of Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor (including
Obligations under the New ABL Credit Agreement) and, if such Priority Lien Obligations being repaid is revolving
credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto or (ii) if the assets or property
disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, to repay any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that
is not a Guarantor;

(2) to repay (i) Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Secured Notes, or (ii) if the assets or property
disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, unsecured Indebtedness and other unsecured obligations of the
Issuer or a Guarantor that rank pari passu with the Secured Notes or such Guarantor’s Secured Note Guarantee
(other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided that if Parent (or the
applicable Restricted Subsidiary) shall so reduce Indebtedness other than the Secured Notes, the Issuer shall equally
and ratably redeem or repurchase the Secured Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” through
open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or by
making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to
purchase the Secured Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the
Secured Notes repurchased, to (but not including) the date of repayment;

(3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, a Permitted Business, if,
(a) after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted

306


-----

Subsidiary of Parent or additional Capital Stock of an existing non-Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary and (b) in
the case of any such acquisition of assets, to the extent the assets are of the type that would constitute Collateral,
such assets are thereupon added to the Collateral following their acquisition;

(4) to make a capital expenditure;

(5) to make an investment in any one or more businesses or property, plant or equipment or acquire
property, plant or equipment, in each case that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; provided that (a) to the
extent that such investment, property, plant or equipment are of the type that would constitute Collateral, such
investment, property, plant or equipment is thereupon added to the Collateral following such investment or
acquisition and (b) such investment is made in accordance with the provisions of the Secured Indenture; or

(6) any combination of the foregoing.

Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) will be deemed to have complied with
the provisions set forth in clause (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the preceding paragraph if, (i) within 450 days after the Asset
Sale that generated the Net Proceeds, Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) has entered into and not
abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment or payment in compliance with the provisions
described in the immediately preceding paragraph, and that investment or payment is thereafter completed within
180 days after the end of such 450-day period or (ii) in the event such binding agreement described in the preceding
clause (i) is cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, Parent (or the applicable
Restricted Subsidiary) enters into another such binding commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or
termination of the prior binding commitment; provided that if any second binding commitment is later cancelled or
terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied within 180 days of such second binding
commitment, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a distribution of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset
Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary to Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary of Parent (i) is (x) prohibited or delayed by
applicable local law, rule or regulation, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or
(z) subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States or
(ii) would have a material adverse tax consequence, as reasonably determined by the Issuer, an amount equal to the
portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant;
_provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which such amount would otherwise have been_
required to be applied pursuant to this covenant, distribution of any of such affected Net Proceeds is no longer
prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, rule or regulation, restricted by any applicable organizational
document or agreement, subject to other organizational or administrative impediment from being repatriated to the
United States, and would not result in a material adverse tax consequences, then an amount equal to such amount of
Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would
be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated, whether or not they are repatriated) in
compliance with this covenant. To the extent that the Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale are attributable to a non-Wholly
Owned Subsidiary, the amount of such Net Proceeds required to be applied in compliance with this covenant shall
not exceed the lesser of (x) an amount corresponding to the proportionate ownership interests in such non-Wholly
Owned Subsidiary or (y) an amount corresponding to the amount of distributions permitted to be made from such
non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary to its direct or indirect parent entity that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary for such
purposes at the time such prepayment is required to be made. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a
consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of
Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Secured Indenture shall be construed to require Parent or any
Foreign Subsidiary to repatriate cash or to apply any Net Proceeds described in clause (i) above in compliance with
this covenant in the event that such repatriation is not permitted under applicable local law, rule or regulation,
applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediment within one year following the date on
which the respective payment would otherwise have been required.

Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Proceeds, Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may
temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net
Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents. Any Net Proceeds
that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant (but excluding for the

307


-----

avoidance of doubt any such proceeds not required to be applied or invested as a result of the fourth paragraph of
this covenant) will constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of proceeds offered to holders in
accordance with clause (2) of the second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer (as defined
below) made at any time after the Asset Sale shall be deemed to have been applied as required and shall not be
deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to the extent to which such offer is accepted by the holders. When the
aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA, within 30 days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Secured
Notes, any other Parity Lien Indebtedness (if required by the terms thereof) and, if the assets or property disposed of
in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is not a Guarantor (other
than Indebtedness owed to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) and/or unsecured Indebtedness and other unsecured
Obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor that rank pari passu with the Secured Notes (other than Indebtedness owed
to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) that, in each case, contains provisions similar to those set forth in the Secured
Indenture with respect to offers to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, to purchase,
prepay or redeem on a pro rata basis the maximum principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Secured
Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and such other Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the
amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased,
prepaid or redeemed out of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer, in the case of the Secured
Notes, will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Secured Notes
repurchased, to (but not including) the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders
of Secured Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior
to the purchase date, and will be payable in cash. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to
such Excess Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds at
any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to
such Excess Proceeds.

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer (any such amount, “Retained
_Declined Proceeds”), the Issuer may use those Retained Declined Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited_
by the Secured Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and other
_pari passu Indebtedness, as applicable, tendered in (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such_
Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer will select the Secured Notes, Parity Lien
Indebtedness and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts
tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed and thereafter the Trustee will select the Secured Notes to be
purchased on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with
respect to the global notes) based on the principal amount tendered (with, in each case, such adjustments as may be
deemed appropriate by the Issuer so that only Secured Notes in minimum denominations of (i) in the case of the
Dollar Secured Notes, $200,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of the Euro
Secured Notes, €100,000, or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in each case, will be purchased;
_provided that any unpurchased portion of a Secured Note must be in a minimum denomination of (i) in the case of_
the Dollar Secured Notes, $200,000 or (ii) in the case of the Euro Secured Notes, €100,000). Upon completion of
each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other
securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with
each repurchase of Secured Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Secured Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset
Sale provisions of the Secured Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the New Credit Agreements and the Unsecured
Indenture, contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would
constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. The exercise by the holders of Secured Notes and holders of
Unsecured Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes,
respectively, upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if
the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not cause a default, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on
us. In the event a Change of Control or Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing
Secured Notes or Unsecured Notes, we could seek the consent of lenders under the New Credit Agreements or such

308


-----

other Indebtedness to the purchase of Secured Notes or Unsecured Notes or could attempt to refinance the
borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will
remain prohibited from purchasing Secured Notes or Unsecured Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase
tendered Secured Notes and Unsecured Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Secured Indenture and
the Unsecured Indenture, respectively, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the New Credit Agreements
and such other Indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of Secured Notes and the holders
of Unsecured Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk
Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a
change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.”

Because the Obligations under the New ABL Credit Agreement are secured by the Current Asset
Collateral, and since the definition of “Net Proceeds” excludes all amounts in respect of any Asset Sale that are used
to repay any Indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, it is unlikely
that any meaningful amount of Net Proceeds will be generated from any Asset Sale of Current Asset Collateral so
long as the New ABL Credit Agreement remains outstanding.

The Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with the
written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Secured Notes) prior to the
date by which the Issuer is required to make such Asset Sale Offer.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Changes in Covenants When Secured Notes Rated Investment Grade_**

If on any date following the Acquisition Closing Date:

(1) a Series of Secured Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both of the Ratings Agencies; and

(2) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,

then, beginning on that day and continuing at all times thereafter and subject to the provisions of the second
succeeding paragraph, (i) the Secured Note Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged (to the extent that guarantees by the Guarantors of all other Priority Lien Obligations and Parity Lien
Indebtedness are substantially concurrently released, and the Liens on the Collateral securing such Priority Lien
Obligations and Parity Lien Indebtedness are also substantially concurrently released) and (ii) the covenants
specifically listed under the following sections in this offering memorandum (collectively, the “Suspended
_Covenants”) will be suspended with respect to such Series of Secured Notes:_

(1) “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales”; but only to the extent related to properties
or assets of Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries that do not constitute Collateral;

(2) “—Restricted Payments”;

(3) “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”;

(4) “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(5) “—Transactions with Affiliates”;

(6) “—Future Guarantees”;

(7) “—Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries”; and

(8) clause (4) of the covenant described below under “—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets.”

309


-----

During any period that the foregoing covenants have been suspended, the Board of Directors of the Issuer
or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may not designate any of Parent’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries pursuant to the covenant described below under “—Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and
Unrestricted Subsidiaries” unless the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer
would have been able, under the terms of the Secured Indenture, to designate such Subsidiaries as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries if the Suspended Covenants were not suspended. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may
be reinstated, the failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (as defined below)
(including any action taken or omitted to be taken with respect thereto and including any actions taken at any time
pursuant to any contractual obligations arising during the Suspension Period) will not give rise to a Default or Event
of Default under the Secured Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Series of Secured Notes no longer have an Investment
Grade Rating from both of the Ratings Agencies, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date
of such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”). The period of time between the suspension of covenants
as set forth above and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” All Indebtedness incurred
(including Acquired Debt) and Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued during the Suspension Period will be
deemed to have been incurred or issued in reliance on the exception provided by clause (2) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt.” Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant will be made as if the
“Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect prior to, but not during, the period that the “Restricted Payments”
covenant was suspended as set forth above. For purposes of determining compliance with the covenant described
above under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the Excess Proceeds from all Asset Sales not
applied in accordance with such covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero after the Reversion Date. In addition,
for purposes of the covenant described under “—Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements
entered into by Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of Parent during the Suspension Period prior
to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (12) of the second paragraph of “—
Transactions with Affiliates,” and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment
Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such
Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been
entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries.”

During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant
described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” or any
provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and during the
Suspension Period.

Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Secured Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant
described under “—Future Guarantees” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on
which any guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of the covenant described under “—Future
Guarantees”).

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be
deemed to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension
Period and Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or
breach of any of the Suspended Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Secured Indenture
with respect to the applicable Series of Secured Notes, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual
commitments or obligations following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby;
_provided that such contractual commitments or obligations were entered into during the Suspension Period and not_
in contemplation of a reversion of the Suspended Covenants; provided, further, that, to the extent any such
commitment or obligation results in the making of a Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made
under clause (c) of the first paragraph or under the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted
Payments” and, if not permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted
under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” and shall be
deducted for purposes of calculating the amount pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not be less than zero).

310


-----

The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Suspension
Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor the ratings of the Secured Notes,
independently determine or verify if such events have occurred or notify the holders of Secured Notes of any
Suspension Period or Reversion Date. The Trustee may provide a copy of such Officer’s Certificate to any holder of
Secured Notes upon written request.

There can be no assurance that either Series of Secured Notes will ever achieve an Investment Grade
Rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_Restricted Payments_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of Parent’s or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries’ Equity Interests (including, without limitation, any payment in connection with
any merger or consolidation involving Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) (other than dividends or
distributions payable in Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent and other than dividends or
distributions payable to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries);

(2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value (including, without limitation, in
connection with any merger or consolidation involving Parent) any Equity Interests of Parent or any direct or
indirect parent of Parent;

(3) make any voluntary or optional payment on or with respect to, or purchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Indebtedness of Parent, the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor in an
outstanding aggregate principal amount greater than the greater of (x) $60.0 million and (y) 10.0% of Consolidated
EBITDA that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Secured Notes or to any Secured Note
Guarantee, except any such payment on Indebtedness permitted under clause (6) or (7) of the definition of
“Permitted Debt” and a payment of interest when due or principal at the Stated Maturity thereof or the purchase,
redemption, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition or retirement for value of any such Indebtedness within 365 days of
the Stated Maturity thereof; or

(4) make any Restricted Investment

(all such payments and other actions set forth in these clauses (1) through (4) above being collectively referred to as
“Restricted Payments”), unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such Restricted Payment:

(a) solely in the case of clause (2) below, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing
or would occur as a consequence of such Restricted Payment;

(b) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such
Restricted Payment has been made at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, the Consolidated Total
Debt Ratio for Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been less than or equal to 6.25 to 1.00; and

(c) such Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted
Payments made by Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries since the Acquisition Closing Date (including Restricted
Payments permitted by clause (3) of the next succeeding paragraph and excluding Restricted Payments permitted by
all other clauses of the next succeeding paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:

(1) the greater of (x) $300.0 million and (y) 50.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(2) an amount (which may not be less than zero) equal to 50% of the Consolidated
Net Income of Parent for the period (taken as one accounting period) from July 1, 2021 to the end
of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements of Parent are
available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such
period is a deficit, less 0% of such deficit); plus

311


-----

(3) 100% of the aggregate net proceeds, including cash and Fair Market Value of
property other than cash (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph),
received by Parent after the Acquisition Closing Date as a contribution to its common equity
capital or from the issue or sale of Qualifying Equity Interests of Parent or any direct or indirect
parent of Parent (excluding, without duplication, Designated Preferred Stock, the Cash
Contribution Amount and Excluded Contributions), or from the issue or sale of Disqualified Stock
of Parent or debt securities of Parent, in each case that have been converted into or exchanged for
Qualifying Equity Interests of Parent (other than Qualifying Equity Interests and convertible or
exchangeable Disqualified Stock or debt securities sold to a Subsidiary of Parent); plus

(4) 100% of the aggregate amount of cash and the Fair Market Value of property
other than cash (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph) received by
Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries from (A) the sale or disposition (other than to Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) of Restricted Investments made after the Acquisition Closing
Date and from repurchases and redemptions of such Restricted Investments from Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries by any Person (other than Parent or its Restricted Subsidiaries) and from
repayments of loans or advances that constituted Restricted Investments made after the
Acquisition Closing Date; (B) the sale (other than to Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries) of the
Capital Stock of an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (C) a distribution or dividend from an Unrestricted
Subsidiary, to the extent that such amounts were not otherwise included in the Consolidated Net
Income of Parent for such period; (D) any Restricted Investment that was made after the
Acquisition Closing Date in a Person that is not a subsidiary at such time that subsequently
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent; and (E) any returns, profits, distributions and similar
amounts received on account of any Permitted Investment made after the Acquisition Closing
Date subject to a dollar-denominated or ratio-based basket (to the extent in excess of the original
amount of such Investment) and without duplication of any returns, profits, distributions or similar
amounts included in the calculation of such basket; plus

(5) in the event that any Unrestricted Subsidiary of Parent designated as such after
the Acquisition Closing Date is redesignated as a Restricted Subsidiary or has been merged or
consolidated with or into or transfers or conveys its assets to, or is liquidated into, Parent or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case after the Acquisition Closing Date, an amount (which may
not be less than zero) equal to 100% of the Fair Market Value of Parent’s Restricted Investment in
such Subsidiary (as determined in accordance with the second succeeding paragraph) as of the
date of such redesignation, combination or transfer (or of the assets transferred or conveyed, as
applicable), after deducting any Indebtedness associated with the Unrestricted Subsidiary so
designated or combined or any Indebtedness associated with the assets so transferred or conveyed
(other than in each case to the extent that the designation of such Subsidiary as an Unrestricted
Subsidiary constituted a Permitted Investment); plus

(6) the aggregate amount of Retained Declined Proceeds since the Acquisition
Closing Date.

The preceding provisions will not prohibit:

(1) the payment of any dividend (or, in the case of any partnership or limited liability company, any
similar distribution) by a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent to the holders of its Equity Interests so long as Parent or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries receives at least its pro rata share of such dividend or distribution;

(2) the making of any Restricted Payment in exchange for, or out of or with the net cash proceeds of
the substantially concurrent sale (other than to a Subsidiary of Parent) of, Equity Interests of Parent (other than

considered to be net proceeds of Qualifying Equity Interests for purposes of clause (c)(3) of the immediately
preceding paragraph;

(3) the payment of any dividend or the consummation of any redemption within 90 days after the date
of declaration of the dividend or giving of the redemption notice, as the case may be, if at the date of declaration or

(4) the repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of Indebtedness
of Parent, the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to the

(5) the repurchase, retirement or other acquisition (or the declaration and payment of dividends to, or
the making of loans to, any direct or indirect parent of Parent, to finance any such repurchase, retirement or other
acquisition) for value of Equity Interests of Parent, any direct or indirect parent of Parent or any Restricted
Subsidiary of Parent held by any future, present or former employee, officer, director, manager, consultant or
independent contractor of Parent, any direct or indirect parent of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (or any such

be, could have incurred such Indebtedness or issued such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock as Ratio Debt);

(35) Indebtedness incurred under the ING RPA; and

(36) all premiums (if any), interest (including post-petition interest and interest paid-in-kind), fees,
expenses, charges and additional or contingent interest on obligations described in clauses (1) through (35) above.

Parent will not incur, and will not permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor to incur, any Indebtedness
(including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of
Parent, the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right
of payment to the Secured Notes and the applicable Secured Note Guarantee on substantially identical terms;
_provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any_
other Indebtedness of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being
secured on a junior priority basis.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness or
any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt
described in clauses (1) through (36) above, or is entitled to be incurred or issued as Ratio Debt, the Issuer will be
permitted to classify, divide or reclassify such item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock on the
date of determination or its incurrence or issuance, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness or
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under any New Term Loan Credit Agreement outstanding on the Acquisition
Closing Date will be deemed to have been incurred in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1)(a) of the
definition of “Permitted Debt” and may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion or
amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in
accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of
additional shares of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or
an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant or the covenant set forth under “—
Liens”; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof shall be included in Fixed Charges of Parent as accrued.
For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar- denominated restriction on the incurrence of
Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of
Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign
currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving or delayed
draw Indebtedness, or first issued, in the case of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or, in each case, at the option
of the borrower or issuer of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the date on which the rate of
interest and other pricing terms of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock are determined or the
date of determination; provided, that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is Indebtedness
incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued to Refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency (or in a different currency from such Indebtedness so being
incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being issued), and such refinancing would cause the applicable
clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” (or categories of Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by
reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” (or categories of
Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA shall be
deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness or liquidation preference of
such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed (i) the outstanding or, in the case of revolving
Indebtedness, committed, principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock being Refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of Additional Refinancing Amounts
incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of
Parent may incur or issue pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of
fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values.

For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness, delayed
draw facility or other committed debt financing incurred under such ratio-based basket, Parent may elect (which
election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), at any time, to either (x) give pro forma effect to
the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness, in which case such committed amount may
thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, without further compliance with any
ratio-based component of any provision of the Secured Indenture, or (y) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of
the actual amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw facility or other committed debt
financing, in which case, the ability to incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness will be subject to
such ratio-based basket (to the extent being incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each such incurrence. For
purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference, as
applicable, of any particular Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued pursuant to and in
compliance with, this covenant, if any commitments in respect of revolving or deferred draw Indebtedness are
established in reliance on any clause of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA, at the Issuer’s option, on the date of the initial borrowing of such Indebtedness or entry into
the definitive agreement providing the commitment to fund such Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the
incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness (such committed amount, a “Grower Tested
_Committed Amount”) may thereafter be borrowed and reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time,_
irrespective of whether or not such incurrence would cause such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be
exceeded and such Grower Tested Committed Amount shall be deemed outstanding pursuant to such basket so long
as such commitments are in effect. If any Indebtedness is incurred or any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is
issued to Refinance Indebtedness (or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness) initially incurred (or
established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued (or to Refinance Indebtedness incurred (or commitments
established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued) to Refinance Indebtedness initially incurred (or
commitments initially established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock initially issued in reliance on any clause
or clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or
a ratio-based basket at the time of incurrence or issuance, and such refinancing would cause such percentage of
Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded or ratio to be unmet if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such
percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or ratio shall not be deemed to be exceeded or unmet (and such Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock shall be deemed permitted) so long as the principal amount or the liquidation
preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the
principal amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being
Refinanced, plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with such refinancing.

Notwithstanding anything in the Secured Indenture to the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, if, on
any date, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related
transactions (A) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock as permitted by a ratio-based or
ratio-referent clause or provision and (B) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under a
non-ratio-based or non-ratio-referent clause or provision, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such date
with respect to any incurrence under the applicable ratio-based or ratio referent clause or provision without giving
effect to the incurrence under such non-ratio-based or non-ratio-referent clause or provision made in connection with
such transaction or series of related transactions.

If Indebtedness originally incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock originally issued in reliance
upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Ratio Incremental Amount under clause (1) of the second
paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the
maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time,
then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified
Stock or preferred stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1)
so long as the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or
preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness,
Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with
such refinancing.

The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be:

323


-----

(1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue
discount;

(2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and

(3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified
Person, the lesser of:

(a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and

(b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.

**_Liens_**

Parent will not, and will not permit the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind (other than Permitted Liens), securing Indebtedness of
Parent, the Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor, if any, on any property or assets now owned or hereafter acquired or
any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom; provided that, Parent, the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor
may create any Lien upon any property or assets that are not at such time Collateral in order to secure any Priority
Lien Obligations or Parity Lien Indebtedness (other than customary liens on cash collateral in connection with the
New ABL Credit Agreement and other revolving credit facilities), so long as it concurrently grants a first-priority
Lien upon such property or assets that would constitute Fixed Asset Collateral or a second-priority Lien upon such
property or assets that would constitute Current Asset Collateral, in each case as security for the Secured Notes or
the Secured Note Guarantees, such that the property or assets subject to such Lien will constitute Collateral under
the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents, subject, in each case, to local law limitations and Permitted
Liens.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the holders of the Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant shall be
deemed automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release of the Lien that gave rise to
the obligation to secure the Secured Notes, (ii) in the case of any such Lien in favor of any Secured Note Guarantee,
the termination and discharge of such Secured Note Guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Secured
Indenture or (iii) any sale, exchange or transfer (other than a transfer constituting a transfer of all or substantially all
of the assets of Parent that is governed by the provisions of the covenant described under “—Merger, Consolidation
or Sale of Assets”) to any Person not an Affiliate of Parent of the property or assets secured by such Lien, or of all of
the Capital Stock held by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in, or all or substantially all the assets of, any
Restricted Subsidiary creating such Lien.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, (A) a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness
need not be permitted solely by reference to one category of Permitted Liens described in the definition of
“Permitted Liens” or pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant but may be permitted in part under any
combination thereof and (B) in the event that a Lien securing an item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) meets
the criteria of one or more of the categories of Permitted Liens described in the definition of “Permitted Liens” or
pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Issuer shall, in its sole discretion, classify or reclassify, or later
divide, classify or reclassify, such Lien securing each item of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in any manner
that complies with this covenant and will only be required to include the amount and type of such Lien or such item
of Indebtedness secured by such Lien in one of the clauses of the definition of “Permitted Liens” and such Lien
securing such item of Indebtedness will be treated as being incurred or existing pursuant to only one of such clauses
or pursuant to the first paragraph hereof.

With respect to any Lien securing Indebtedness that was permitted to secure such Indebtedness at the time
of the incurrence thereof, such Lien shall also be permitted to secure any Increased Amount of such Indebtedness.

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are not the Issuer or Guarantors
to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on
the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor to:

Closing Date, or (ii) are not materially more disadvantageous to holders of the Secured Notes than is customary in
comparable financings (as determined by the Issuer in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive) and in
the case of subclause (ii) either (x) the Issuer determines (in good faith) that such encumbrance or restriction will not
affect the Issuer’s ability to make principal or interest payments on the Secured Notes or (y) such encumbrances or
restrictions apply only during the continuance of a default in respect of payment or a financial maintenance covenant
relating to such Indebtedness;

(4) applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction;

in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or

Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Secured Indenture that restricts distributions by that Restricted
Subsidiary pending such sale or other disposition;

more restrictive as a whole with respect to such dividend and other payment restrictions than those contained in the
dividend or other payment restrictions prior to such amendment, modification, restatement, renewal, increase,
supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing.

receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common
shares shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make distributions on Capital Stock and (ii) the
subordination of loans or advances made to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to other Indebtedness
incurred by Parent or any such Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed a restriction on the ability to make loans or

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

Parent and the Issuer will not, directly or indirectly: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person,
(2) consummate a Division as the Dividing Person (whether or not Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, is the

to the Guarantors and (b) in the case of the Issuer, assumes all the obligations of the Issuer under the Secured Notes
and the Secured Indenture, pursuant to a supplemental indenture, and the Security Documents pursuant to the terms
thereof, as applicable;

(3) immediately after such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists;

(4) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity would, after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related
financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, (a) be

consolidation, merger, Division, sale, conveyance, assignment, transfer, lease or other disposition complies with the
requirements of the Secured Indenture;

(6) to the extent any property or assets of the Surviving Entity are property or assets of the type that
would constitute Collateral under the Security Documents, the Surviving Entity will take such action as may be
reasonably necessary or required to cause such property and assets to be made subject to a Lien securing the Secured
Notes pursuant to the Secured Indenture and the Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required by the
Secured Indenture or any of the Security Documents and shall take all reasonably necessary action so that such Lien

limited partnership, limited liability company or trust organized or existing under the laws of the United States, any
state thereof, the District of Columbia or, in the case of Parent, the Cayman Islands. In addition, Parent or any
Restricted Subsidiary may change its name.

All references to “Parent” or “Issuer,” as applicable, in this “Description of Secured Notes” shall be
deemed to include any successor entity that assumes all of the obligations of Parent or the Issuer, as applicable,
under the Secured Notes in a transaction that complies with this “Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets” covenant.
Following any such assumption (except in the case of a lease), Parent, the Issuer or such predecessor company, as
the case may be, shall be released from its obligations under the Secured Indenture and the Secured Notes.

**_Transactions with Affiliates_**

Parent will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to or sell, lease,
transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter
into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for
the benefit of, any Affiliate of Parent involving aggregate payments or consideration in excess of the greater of (x)
$45.0 million and (y) 7.5% of Consolidated EBITDA (each, an “Affiliate Transaction”), unless:

(1) the Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
Parent or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by
Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person (as determined in good faith by the senior
management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer); and

(2) with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
aggregate consideration in excess of the greater of (x) $120.0 million and (y) 20.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, the

the provisions of the prior paragraph:

(1) any reasonable or customary employment agreement, consulting agreement, severance agreement,
employee benefit plan, compensation arrangement, officer or director indemnification agreement or any similar
arrangement entered into by, or policy of, Parent, any direct or indirect parent of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary
of Parent and payments pursuant thereto;

amalgamation or consolidation is otherwise in compliance with the terms of the Secured Indenture and effected for a
bona fide business purpose;

Parent solely because Parent owns, directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls,

otherwise) of officers, directors, employees, independent contractors or consultants of Parent or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries or any direct or indirect parent of Parent;

(5) any sale, issuance or transfer of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of Parent or any

days of the Acquisition Closing Date, and the payment of fees and expenses not in excess of the amounts specified
in, or determined pursuant to, such agreements, as in effect within 30 days of the Acquisition Closing Date;
_provided, however, that the existence of, or the performance by Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries of their_
respective obligations under, any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar agreement
entered into after the Acquisition Closing Date shall only be permitted by this clause (7) to the extent that the terms
of any such existing agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, or new agreement are not
otherwise more disadvantageous (as determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of
the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) to the holders of the Secured Notes in any material respect
than the original agreement as in effect within 30 days of the Acquisition Closing Date;

(8) if such Affiliate Transaction is with a Person in its capacity as a holder of Indebtedness,

Person is treated no more favorably than the other holders of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock, preferred stock or
Capital Stock of Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent;

(9) transactions with an Affiliate where the only consideration paid is Qualifying Equity Interests of
Parent;

Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) meets the requirements of clause (1) of the preceding
paragraph;

-----

(12) any agreement as in effect as of the Acquisition Closing Date or any amendment thereto (so long
as any such agreement together with all amendments thereto, taken as a whole, is not more disadvantageous in any
material respect (as determined in good faith by the senior management or the Board of Directors of the Issuer or
any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer) to the holders of the Secured Notes in any material respect than the
original agreement as in effect on the Acquisition Closing Date) or any transaction contemplated thereby;

(13) transactions with joint ventures entered into in the ordinary course of business;

(14) any contributions to the common equity capital of Parent or any investments by the Principals or a

connection therewith);

Issuer, or of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent, as appropriate, in good faith;

(17) the entry into any tax-sharing arrangements between Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
and any of their direct or indirect parents; provided, however, that any payment made by Parent or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under such tax-sharing arrangements is, at the time made, otherwise permitted by the
covenant described above under “—Restricted Payments”;

(18) transactions with Unrestricted Subsidiaries, customers, clients, lessors, landlords, suppliers,

Restricted Subsidiaries, or made in the reasonable determination of senior management or the Board of Directors of
the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer;

(19) transactions between Parent and any Person that is an Affiliate solely due to the fact that a director

matter involving such other Person;

-----

(24) transactions undertaken in good faith (as certified by a responsible financial or accounting officer
of Parent in an Officers’ Certificate) for the purpose of improving the consolidated tax efficiency of Parent and its
Subsidiaries and not for the purpose of circumventing any covenant set forth in the Secured Indenture.

**_Future Guarantees_**

If, after the Acquisition Closing Date, (a) any Subsidiary of Parent (including any newly formed, newly
acquired or newly redesignated Restricted Subsidiary, but excluding any Securitization Entity and any Excluded
Subsidiary) that is not then a Guarantor guarantees or incurs any Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement or (b) Parent otherwise elects to have any Restricted Subsidiary become a Guarantor, then, in each such
case, Parent shall cause such Restricted Subsidiary to execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture to
the Secured Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary shall become a Guarantor under the Secured
Indenture providing for a Secured Note Guarantee by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms and conditions
as those set forth in the Secured Indenture and applicable to the other Guarantors; provided that, in the case of clause
(a), such supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered to the Trustee within 20 business days of the date
that such Indebtedness under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement has been guaranteed or incurred by such
Restricted Subsidiary.

Each Secured Note Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by that Restricted Subsidiary without rendering the Secured Note Guarantee, as it relates to such
Restricted Subsidiary, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, financial
assistance, corporate benefit, capital maintenance or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally.
However, such limitations may not be effective under local law. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and
Our Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or
the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes) and, if that occurs, you
may not receive any payments on the Notes.”

Each Person that becomes a Guarantor after the Acquisition Closing Date shall also become a party to the
applicable Security Documents and shall as promptly as practicable execute and deliver such security instruments,
financing statements, mortgages, deeds of trust and other related real estate deliverables (in substantially the same
form as those executed and delivered with respect to the Collateral on the Acquisition Closing Date or on the date
first delivered in the case of Collateral delivered after the Acquisition Closing Date (to the extent, and substantially
in the form, delivered on the Acquisition Closing Date or the date first delivered, as applicable (but no greater
scope)) as may be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected first-priority security interest (subject
to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute Fixed Asset Collateral and a perfected second-priority
security interest (subject to Permitted Liens) in properties and assets that constitute Current Asset Collateral, in
either case, as security for such Guarantor’s Secured Note Guarantee and as may be necessary to have such property
or assets added to the Collateral as required under the Security Documents and the Secured Indenture, and thereupon
all provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such properties and
assets to the same extent and with the same force and effect.

Each Secured Note Guarantee shall be released upon the terms and in accordance with the provisions of the
Secured Indenture described under “—Secured Note Guarantees.”

**_Designation of Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

After the Acquisition Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of
the Issuer may designate any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary if that designation
would not cause a Default. If such Restricted Subsidiary is designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the aggregate
Fair Market Value of all outstanding Investments in such Restricted Subsidiary by Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries will be deemed to be an Investment made as of the time of determination or the designation and will
reduce the amount available for Restricted Payments under the covenant described above under “—Restricted
Payments” or under one or more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments,” as determined by the Issuer.
That designation will only be permitted if the Investment would be permitted at that time and if such Restricted
Subsidiary otherwise meets the definition of an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

331


-----

Any designation of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent as an Unrestricted Subsidiary will be evidenced to the
Trustee by filing with the Trustee a certified copy of a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Issuer or any direct
or indirect parent of the Issuer giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complied with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under “—
Restricted Payments” or under one of more clauses of the definition of “Permitted Investments.” If, at any time, any
Unrestricted Subsidiary would fail to meet the preceding requirements as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, it will
thereafter cease to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary for purposes of the Secured Indenture and any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary will be deemed to be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be incurred as of such date under the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and
Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, the Issuer will be in default of such covenant. The Board of
Directors of the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer may at any time designate any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to be a Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such designation will be deemed to be an incurrence of
Indebtedness by a Restricted Subsidiary of any outstanding Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary, and such
designation will only be permitted if (1) such Indebtedness is permitted under the covenant described under “—
Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock”, calculated on a Pro Forma Basis
as if such designation had occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; and (2) no Event of Default
would be in existence following such designation. Any designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary shall be evidenced to the Trustee by an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such designation complied
with the preceding conditions and was permitted by the covenant described above under “—Incurrence of
Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock.”

**_Reports_**

The Secured Indenture will provide that so long as any Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will
provide the Trustee and, upon request, to holders of Secured Notes a copy of all of the information and reports
referred to below:

(1) within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year (or 150 days after the end of the first fiscal year
after the Acquisition Closing Date) (or such longer period as may be permitted by the Commission pursuant to the
reporting requirements for a non-accelerated filer), annual audited consolidated financial statements of Parent that
would have been required to be contained in an Annual Report on Form 10-K under the Exchange Act if Parent had
been a reporting company under the Exchange Act for such fiscal year (but only to the extent similar information is
presented in this offering memorandum), including a “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” with respect to the periods presented and a report on the annual financial
statements by Parent’s independent accountants (all of the foregoing financial information to be prepared on a basis
substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information included in this offering memorandum);

(2) from and after the first fiscal quarter ending after the Acquisition Closing Date, within 45 days
after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year (or 75 days after the end of each of the first
three fiscal quarters ending after the Acquisition Closing Date for which delivery is required hereunder) (or such
longer period as may be permitted by the Commission pursuant to the reporting requirements for a non-accelerated
filer), unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements of Parent (including a balance sheet and related
statements of profit and loss and statement of cash flows) that would have been required to be contained in a
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act if Parent had been a reporting company under the
Exchange Act for the interim period as of, and for the period ending on, the end of such fiscal quarter (but only to
the extent similar information is presented in this offering memorandum), including a “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (all of the foregoing financial information to be
prepared on a basis substantially consistent with the corresponding financial information included in this offering
memorandum), subject to normal year-end adjustments and the absence of footnotes; and

(3) within 15 days after the time period specified for filing current reports on Form 8-K by the
Commission, current reports containing substantially all of the information that would be required to be filed in a
current report on Form 8-K under the Exchange Act on the Acquisition Closing Date pursuant to Items 1.01, 1.03,
2.01, 2.03, 2.04, 4.01, 4.02, 5.01, 5.02(a) through (c) (other than compensation information), and 5.03(b) (in each
case, excluding the financial statements, pro forma financial information and exhibits, if any, that would be required
by Item 9.01) of Form 8-K if Parent had been a reporting company under the Exchange Act; provided, however, that

332


-----

no such current report will be required to be furnished if Parent determines in its good faith judgment that such event
is not material to holders or the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects of Parent and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or if the Issuer determines in its good faith judgment that such disclosure
would otherwise cause material competitive harm to the business, assets, operations, financial position or prospects
of Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or contains any trade secrets, privileged or confidential
information obtained from another Person or competitively sensitive information;

_provided, however, that in addition to providing such information to the Trustee, the Issuer will be required to make_
available to the holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Secured Notes, bona fide market makers in the
Secured Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser and bona fide securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis
of investment in the Secured Notes) such information by (i) posting to its website (or the website of any direct or
indirect parent of the Issuer or of a Subsidiary of Parent) or on IntraLinks or any comparable password-protected
online data system, in each case, subject to the extensions provided for in clauses (1) and (2) above, within 15 days
after the time the Issuer would be required to provide such information pursuant to clause (1), (2) or (3) above, as
applicable, or (ii) otherwise providing substantially comparable availability of such reports (as determined by the
Issuer in good faith) (it being understood that, without limitation, making such reports available on Bloomberg or
another comparable private electronic information service shall constitute substantially comparable availability).
The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such reports to such holders, bona fide prospective investors in the
Secured Notes, bona fide market makers in the Secured Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser and bona fide
securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Secured Notes) on the agreement of such
Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not
use such reports and the information contained therein for any purpose other than their investment or potential
investment in the Secured Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained
therein) and information; and the Issuer may deny access to any competitively-sensitive information and reports
otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Secured
Notes, bona fide market makers in the Secured Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser and bona fide securities
analysts (to the extent providing analysis of investment in the Secured Notes) that is a competitor of Parent and its
Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of such information and reports
to such Person would be competitively harmful to Parent and its Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the Issuer will not be required to furnish any information, financial
statements, certificates or reports required by (i) Section 302, Section 404 or Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, or related Items 307 or 308 of Regulation S-K, (ii) Regulation G or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K
promulgated by the Commission with respect to any non-GAAP financial measures contained therein, or
(iii) Rule 3-01(e), Rule 3-05, Rule 3-09, Rule 3-10 or Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X, (b) such reports will not be
required to contain any segment reporting, (c) such reports shall not be required to present compensation required by
Item 402 of Regulation S-K or otherwise or beneficial ownership information; and (d) the information and reports
referred to in clauses (1), (2) and (3) in the first paragraph of this covenant shall not be required to include any
exhibits required by Item 15 of Form 10-K, Item 6 of Form 10-Q or Item 9.01 of Form 8-K.

The Issuer will be deemed to have furnished such reports referred to above to the Trustee and the holders of
the Secured Notes if the Issuer or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer has (i) filed such reports with the
Commission via the EDGAR (or successor) filing system or if such reports are otherwise publicly available, or (ii)
posted such reports on the Issuer’s (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or any Subsidiary of Parent)
website. The Trustee will have no responsibility to determine whether such posting has occurred.

For so long as any Subsidiaries of Parent have been designated as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the
quarterly and annual financial information required to be provided by this covenant will include a reasonably
detailed summary presentation (which need not be audited or reviewed by the auditors), either on the face of the
financial statements, in the footnotes thereto, in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations” or other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of Parent
and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of Parent.

In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any Secured
Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to holders of the Secured Notes and to prospective investors, upon their

333


-----

request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act (or any
successor provision).

In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, the financial statements, information and other information and
documents required to be provided as described above may be, rather than those of Parent, those of (a) any
predecessor or successor of Parent or any entity meeting the requirements of clause (b) or (c) of this paragraph, (b)
any Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent that, together with its consolidated Subsidiaries, constitutes substantially all
of the assets of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries (“Qualified Reporting Subsidiary”) or (c) any direct or
indirect parent of Parent; provided that, if the financial information so furnished relates to such Qualified Reporting
Subsidiary of Parent or such direct or indirect parent of Parent, the same is accompanied by consolidating
information, which may be posted to the website of the Issuer (or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or any
Subsidiary of Parent) or on a non-public, password-protected website maintained by the Issuer or a third party, that
explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Qualified Reporting Subsidiary
or such parent entity (as the case may be), on the one hand, and the information relating to Parent and its Restricted
Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand. For the avoidance of doubt, the consolidating information
referred to in the proviso in the preceding sentence need not be audited or reviewed by Parent’s independent
accountants.

So long as Secured Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will also:

(a) within 15 business days after furnishing to the Trustee the annual and quarterly reports required by
clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this “Reports” covenant, use commercially reasonable efforts to hold a
conference call, at a time selected by the Issuer, to discuss such reports and the results of operations for the relevant
reporting period (it being understood that any such call may be combined with any similar call held for any of
Parent’s or the Issuer’s other lenders or security holders); and

(b) post to its or the Issuer’s website (or the website of any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer or of a
Subsidiary of Parent) or on IntraLinks or any comparable password-protected online data system, which will require
a confidentiality acknowledgment, prior to the date of the conference call required to be held in accordance with
clause (a) of this paragraph, announcing the time and date of such conference call and either including all
information necessary to access the call or informing holders, prospective investors, market makers affiliated with
any initial purchaser and securities analysts how they can obtain such information, including, without limitation, the
applicable password or other login information.

Any Person who requests or accesses such financial information required by this covenant will be required
to represent to the Issuer (to the reasonable good faith satisfaction of the Issuer) that:

(1) it is a holder, a Beneficial Owner of the Secured Notes, a bona fide prospective investor in the
Secured Notes or a bona fide market maker in the Secured Notes affiliated with any initial purchaser or a bona fide
securities analyst providing an analysis of investment in the Secured Notes;

(2) it will not use the information in violation of applicable securities laws or regulations;

(3) it will keep such information confidential and will not communicate the information to any Person
and not use such information in any manner intended to compete with the business of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
and

(4) it is not a Person (which includes such Person’s Affiliates) that (i) is principally engaged in a
Permitted Business or (ii) derives a significant portion of its revenue from operating a Permitted Business.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Issuer to comply with any of its obligations
hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will not constitute an Event of
Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder. To the extent any
information is not provided within the time periods specified in this covenant and such information is subsequently

334


-----

provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default
with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

The delivery of any reports, information and documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only
and the Trustee’s receipt of such shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or notice of any information
contained therein.

**Financial Calculations for Limited Condition Transactions**

The Secured Indenture shall provide that, as it relates to any action being taken in connection with a
Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of (i) determining compliance with any provision of the Secured
Indenture that requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio,
Consolidated Total Debt Ratio, Consolidated Senior Secured Debt Ratio and Consolidated First Lien Debt Ratio, or
(ii) testing availability under baskets set forth in the Secured Indenture (including baskets determined by reference to
Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, as applicable), in each case, at the option of Issuer (the Issuer’s election to
exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction to be evidenced by delivery of an
Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee, an “LCT Election”), the date of determination of whether any such action is
permitted hereunder shall be made (1) in the case of any acquisition (including by way of merger) or similar
Investment (including the assumption or incurrence of Indebtedness in connection therewith), at the time of (or, in
the case of any calculation or any financial ratio or test, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently
ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately
preceding the date on which such calculation is made at the time of) either (x) the execution of the definitive
agreement with respect to such acquisition or Investment, (y) the public announcement of an intention to make an
offer in respect of the target of such acquisition or Investment or (z) the consummation of such acquisition or
Investment, (2) in the case of any Restricted Payment, at the time of (or, in the case of any calculation or any
financial ratio or test, with respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four consecutive
fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
calculation is made at the time of) (x) the irrevocable declaration of such Restricted Payment or (y) the making of
such Restricted Payment and (3) in the case of any voluntary or optional payment or prepayment on or redemption
or acquisition for value of any Indebtedness subject to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—
Restricted Payments,” at the time of (or, in the case of any calculation or any financial ratio or test, with respect to,
or as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal financial
statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such calculation is made at the time of) (x)
delivery of irrevocable (which may be conditional) notice with respect to such payment or prepayment or
redemption or acquisition of such Indebtedness or (y) the making of such voluntary or optional payment or
prepayment on or redemption or acquisition for value of any Indebtedness (the “LCT Test Date”), and if, for the
Limited Condition Transaction (and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith), Parent or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in
compliance with such ratio, test or basket, such ratio, test or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with. For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election and any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which
compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would have failed to have been complied with as a
result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA or
Total Assets of Parent or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation
of the relevant transaction or action, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have failed to have been
complied with as a result of such fluctuations; provided, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if
financial statements for one or more subsequent periods of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such calculation is made shall have
become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such financial ratios or tests, with
respect to, or as of the last day of, the most recently ended period of four consecutive fiscal quarters for which
internal financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such calculation is made on the
basis of such financial statements, in which case such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the
LCT Test Date for purposes of such baskets, ratios and financial metrics. If the Issuer has made an LCT Election for
any Limited Condition Transaction, then in connection with any calculation of any ratio, test or basket availability
with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or Permitted Liens, the making of Restricted Payments, the making of
any Permitted Investment, mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of
Parent, the prepayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of Indebtedness, or the designation of

335


-----

an Unrestricted Subsidiary (each, a “Subsequent Transaction”) following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to
the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive
agreement, public announcement or irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated,
revoked or expires without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining
whether such Subsequent Transaction is permitted under the Secured Indenture, any such ratio, test or basket shall
be required to be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other
transactions in connection therewith (including any incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have
been consummated.

**Events of Default and Remedies**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default”:

(1) default for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Secured Notes;

(2) default in the payment when due (at maturity, upon redemption, offer to purchase or otherwise) of
the principal of, or premium, if any, on, the Secured Notes;

(3) failure by Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries for 60 days after notice by the Trustee to the
Issuer or by the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the Secured Notes then outstanding to the
Issuer and the Trustee to comply with any of the agreements in the Secured Indenture (other than a default referred
to in clause (1) or (2) above) or the Security Documents; provided that in the case of a failure to comply with the
Secured Indenture provisions described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports,” such period of continuance of such
default or breach shall be 120 days after written notice described in this clause (3) has been given;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries or any Affiliate) of Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant
Subsidiary or the Issuer (or the payment of which is guaranteed by Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a
Significant Subsidiary or the Issuer), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date
of the Secured Indenture, if that default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or premium, if any, on any such Indebtedness at final
Stated Maturity (after giving effect to any applicable grace periods) (a “Payment Default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity, and, in each case, the
principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under
which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates at least the
greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA;

(5) failure by Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or the Issuer to
pay final non-appealable judgments entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction aggregating in excess of
the greater of (x) $150.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (other than any judgments covered by
indemnities or insurance policies issued by reputable companies), which judgments are not paid, discharged or
stayed, for a period of 60 days, after the applicable judgment becomes final and non-appealable;

(6) except as permitted by the Secured Indenture, any Secured Note Guarantee of Parent or a
Significant Subsidiary of Parent is held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or ceases for any
reason to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms of the Secured Indenture), or Parent or any
Significant Subsidiary of Parent, or any Person acting on behalf Parent or such Significant Subsidiary of Parent, as
applicable, denies or disaffirms its obligations under its Secured Note Guarantee and any such Default continues for
10 days;

336


-----

(7) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency described in the Secured Indenture with respect to
Parent, any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer;

(8) failure by the Issuer to consummate the Special Mandatory Redemption as described under “—
Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption;”

(9) any material provision of any Security Document or Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the
Secured Notes, at any time, (a) ceases to be in full force and effect for any reason other than in accordance with the
terms of the Secured Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements or (b) is declared invalid
or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) the Issuer or any Guarantor contests in writing the validity
or enforceability of any material provision of any Security Document or Intercreditor Agreement or (z) the Issuer or
any Guarantor denies in writing that it has any further liability under the Secured Indenture or any Security
Document or Intercreditor Agreement or gives written notice to revoke or rescind any Security Document or the
perfected first-priority or second-priority Liens, as applicable, created thereby with respect to the Secured Notes,
other than in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreements; or

(10) any Security Document covering a material portion of the Collateral for any reason (other than
pursuant to the terms thereof) ceases to create a valid and perfected first-priority or second-priority Lien, as
applicable, on, and security interest in, any material Collateral covered thereby with respect to the Secured Notes,
subject to Permitted Liens, except (a) to the extent that any such perfection or priority is not required pursuant to the
Secured Indenture and the Security Documents or results from the failure of the Notes Collateral Agent to maintain
possession of certificates actually delivered to it representing securities pledged under the Security Documents or (b)
as to Collateral consisting of real property, to the extent that such losses are covered by a title insurance policy in
favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Secured Notes and
such insurers have not denied or failed to acknowledge coverage.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to
either Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted
Subsidiaries of Parent that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer, all outstanding
Secured Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of
Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Secured Notes by notice to the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee if given by holders of Secured Notes)
may declare all the Secured Notes to be due and payable immediately.

Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Secured Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. In case an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, for purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Secured Notes that have directed the
Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Secured Notes
shall be calculated by the Trustee or its agent using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen
(or such other services as may be selected by the Trustee or its agent in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m.
(New York City time) on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such direction. The Trustee shall have
no liability for making such calculation. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Secured Notes notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or
Event of Default relating to the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on the Secured
Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes because an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in clause (4) under the first paragraph
of “—Events of Default and Remedies” (excluding any resulting payment default under the Secured Indenture or the
Secured Notes), the declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if such
Indebtedness is paid or otherwise acquired or retired or the holders of all Indebtedness described in clause (4) have
rescinded or waived the declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 20 business days of the
date of such declaration of acceleration of the Secured Notes, and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Secured
Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and all existing Events of

337


-----

Default, except non-payment of principal or interest on the Secured Notes that became due solely because of the
acceleration of the Secured Notes, have been cured or waived and all amounts owing to the Trustee and Notes
Collateral Agent have been paid.

The Secured Indenture will provide that if a Default is deemed to occur solely as a consequence of the
existence of another Default (the “Initial Default”), then, at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default that
resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action.

In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will be
under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Secured Indenture at the request or direction of
any holders of Secured Notes unless such holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee or the
Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee and/or Notes Collateral
Agent against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest, if
any, when due, no holder of a Secured Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Secured Indenture or the
Secured Notes (subject to the Intercreditor Agreements) unless:

(1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing;

(2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes make
a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such holder or holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral
Agent security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request
and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) during such 60-day period, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then
outstanding Secured Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes by written
notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Secured Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any
existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Secured Indenture, if the rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of,
premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, the Secured Notes (except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any, or
interest on the Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Secured Notes).

Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default,
notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders
(other than any holder that is a Regulated Bank, an initial purchaser or its Affiliate (in each case, as evidenced by
delivery of an officer’s certificate to the Trustee from such initial purchaser or Affiliate certifying as to its status as
an initial purchaser or Affiliate thereof)) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written
representation from each such holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder
is DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees, that such holder is being instructed solely by
beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”),
which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default, shall be deemed repeated
at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In
addition, each Directing Holder is deemed at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction to covenant to provide the
Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the
accuracy of such noteholder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification
_Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees, any_
Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of
the notes in lieu of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective nominees and DTC or Euroclear or

338


-----

Clearstream, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification
Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee.

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the Issuer
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in
breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that the Issuer has instituted
litigation with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such
time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the
applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the
cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending
a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the
delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Secured Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee
an Officers’ Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period
with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event
of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy
stayed until such time as the Issuer provides the Trustee with an Officers’ Certificate that the Verification Covenant
has been satisfied; provided that the Issuer shall promptly deliver such Officers’ Certificate to the Trustee upon
becoming aware that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied. Any breach of the Position Representation (as
evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee) shall result in such Holder’s participation in such
Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Secured
Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to
validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that
such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed
not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default; provided,
however, this shall not invalidate any indemnity or security provided by the Directing Holders to the Trustee which
obligations shall continue to survive.

Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction
delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of bankruptcy or similar
proceedings shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing two paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction,
Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officer’s Certificate or other document delivered to it pursuant to
the foregoing paragraphs, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position
Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s
Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated
Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise
and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to
the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether
any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Secured
Indenture or any other agreement or whether or not any holder is a Regulated Bank.

With their acquisition of the Secured Notes, each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Secured Notes
consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of
this provision. Each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Secured Notes waives any and all claims, in law and/or
in equity, against the Trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and
agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or
arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder
Direction.

Other than in connection with actions resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
of the Trustee, the Issuer waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and agrees not to
commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for
any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or arising out of or in connection with following
instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction.

339


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee will treat all holders equally with respect to their rights under this
“Events of Default and Remedies” provision. In connection with the requisite percentages required under the
Secured Indenture to exercise remedies, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat all outstanding Secured Notes equally
irrespective of any Position Representation in determining whether the requisite percentage has been obtained with
respect to the initial delivery of the Noteholder Direction.

The Issuer agrees that any and all other actions that the Trustee takes or omits to take in connection with
the foregoing net short language and all fees, costs expenses of the Trustee and its agents and counsel arising as a
result of, or in connection with, the application of such provision shall be covered by the Issuer’s indemnification
obligations set forth in the Secured Indenture.

The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually an Officer’s Certificate regarding compliance with
the Secured Indenture within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year (beginning with the first full fiscal year after
the Issue Date, which may be delivered within 150 days after the end of such fiscal year). Upon becoming aware of
any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days of becoming aware of
such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30
day period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default, its status and what action the Issuer
or any Guarantor propose to take with respect thereto.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Equity Holders, including Members**

No manager, managing director, director, officer, employee, incorporator or equity holder, including
members, of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or any direct or indirect parent of the Issuer, as such, will have any liability
for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Secured Notes, the Secured Indenture, the Secured Note
Guarantees, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by
reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each holder of Secured Notes by accepting a Secured Note waives and
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Secured Notes. The
waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws.

**Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance**

The Issuer may at any time elect to have all of the Issuer’s obligations discharged with respect to a Series
of Secured Notes, the outstanding Secured Notes of such Series, all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with
respect to their Secured Note Guarantees of such Series and the Liens with respect to such Series released (“Legal
_Defeasance”), except for:_

(1) the rights of holders of Secured Notes of such Series to receive payments in respect of the
principal of premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on, such Secured Notes when such payments are due from the
trust referred to below;

(2) the Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Secured Notes of such Series concerning issuing
temporary Secured Notes, registration of transfer of such Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Secured
Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;

(3) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee under the Secured Indenture, and
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ obligations in connection therewith; and

(4) the Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance provision of the Secured Indenture.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants (including the obligation to make Change of Control Offers
and Asset Sale Offers) that are described in the Secured Indenture with respect to a Series of Secured Notes
(“Covenant Defeasance”) and thereafter any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default
or Event of Default with respect to the Secured Notes of such Series. In the event Covenant Defeasance occurs, all
Events of Default described under “—Events of Default and Remedies” (except those relating to payments on the

340


-----

Secured Notes, covenants that are not subject to Covenant Defeasance or bankruptcy, receivership, rehabilitation or
insolvency events) will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Secured Notes of such Series.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to a Series of Secured
Notes:

(1) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the holders of the
Secured Notes of such Series, (a) in the case of the Dollar Secured Notes, (i) cash in U.S. dollars in an amount, (ii)
non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and interest
thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in amounts, or (b) in the case of the Euro Secured Notes,
(i) cash in euro in an amount, (ii) non-callable euro-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of
principal of and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in amounts, in each case, as will
be sufficient, without consideration of any reinvestment of interest, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
investment bank, appraisal firm or firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium on, if
any, and interest, if any, on, the outstanding Secured Notes of such Series to the stated date for payment thereof or to
the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and all interest, if any, accrued to such dates, and the Issuer must
specify whether such Secured Notes are being defeased to such stated date for payment or to a particular redemption
date;

(2) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee, (a) in the case of Legal Defeasance, an opinion of counsel to
the effect that (i) the Issuer has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling,
or (ii) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to
the effect that, and based thereon such opinion of counsel will confirm, that the beneficial owners of outstanding
Secured Notes of such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result
of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred; and (b) in the case of
Covenant Defeasance, an opinion of counsel to the effect the beneficial owners of outstanding Secured Notes of
such Series will not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant
Defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been in the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(3) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the date of such deposit (other
than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit (and any
similar concurrent deposit relating to other Indebtedness), and the granting of Liens to secure such borrowings);

(4) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of or
constitute a default under, any material agreement or instrument (other than the Secured Indenture and the
agreements governing any other Indebtedness being defeased, discharged or replaced) to which the Issuer or any of
the Guarantors is a party or by which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is bound;

(5) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made
by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of Secured Notes of such Series over the other creditors of the
Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding any creditors of the Issuer or others; and

(6) the Issuer must deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

**Amendment, Supplement and Waiver**

Except as otherwise provided in this “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”, the Secured Indenture, the
Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Secured Notes or the Secured Note
Guarantees may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes other than Secured Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer
or its Affiliates (including, without limitation, Additional Secured Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including,

341


-----

without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the
Secured Notes), and any existing Default or Event of Default (other than a Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, the Secured Notes, except a payment default
resulting from an acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of the Secured Indenture,
the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Secured Notes or the Secured
Note Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the then outstanding Secured Notes other than Secured Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates
(including, without limitation, Additional Secured Notes, if any) voting as a single class (including, without
limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Secured Notes);
_provided that (x) if any such amendment or waiver will only affect one Series of Secured Notes (or less than all_
Series of Secured Notes) then outstanding under the Secured Indenture, then only the consent of the holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes of such Series then outstanding (including, in each case, consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for, or purchase of, the Secured Notes) shall be required
and (y) if any such amendment or waiver by its terms will affect a Series of Secured Notes in a manner different and
materially adverse relative to the manner such amendment or waiver affects other Series of Secured Notes, then the
consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Secured Notes of such Series then outstanding
(including, in each case, consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Secured Notes)
shall be required.

Without the consent of each holder of the then outstanding Secured Notes affected, an amendment,
supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any Secured Notes held by a non-consenting holder):

(1) reduce the principal amount of Secured Notes whose holders must consent to an amendment,
supplement or waiver;

(2) reduce the principal of or change the Stated Maturity of any Secured Note or alter or waive any of
the provisions relating to the dates on which the Secured Notes may be redeemed or the redemption price thereof
with respect to the redemption of the Secured Notes (other than any change to the notice periods with respect to such
redemption);

(3) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest, including default interest, on any
Secured Note;

(4) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest,
if any, on, the Secured Notes (except a rescission of acceleration of a Series of Secured Notes by the holders of at
least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes of such Series and a waiver of
the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);

(5) make any Secured Note payable in money other than that stated therein;

(6) make any change in the provisions of the Secured Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or
the rights of holders of Secured Notes to receive payments of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on,
the Secured Notes;

(7) subject to the final paragraph under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,”
modify the obligation of the Issuer to repurchase Secured Notes under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders,”
after the date of an event giving rise to such repurchase obligation;

(8) release Parent or any Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary from any of its obligations under
its Secured Note Guarantee or the Secured Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture;

(9) make any change in the preceding amendment and waiver provisions;

(10) make any change to, or modify, the ranking of the Secured Notes in respect of right of payment in
a manner that would adversely affect the holders of the Secured Notes; or

342


-----

(11) waive or modify in a manner materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Secured
Notes the provisions relating to the Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Secured Notes in a Special Mandatory
Redemption.

In addition, without the consent of the holders of at least 66[2]/3% in aggregate principal amount of the
Secured Notes then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Secured Notes), no amendment, supplement or waiver may (1) have the
effect of releasing all or substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens created pursuant to the Security Documents
(except as permitted by the terms of the Secured Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements)
or changing or altering the priority of the security interests of the holders of the Secured Notes in the Collateral
under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement or the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, (2) make any change in the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or the provisions in the Secured Indenture dealing with the
application of proceeds of the Collateral that would adversely affect the holders of the Secured Notes or (3) modify
the Security Documents or the provisions of the Secured Indenture dealing with Collateral in any manner adverse to
the holders of the Secured Notes in any material respect other than in accordance with the terms of the Secured
Indenture, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements; provided that (x) if any such amendment,
supplement or waiver will only affect one series of Secured Notes (or less than all series of the Secured Notes) then
outstanding under the Secured Indenture, then only the consent of the holders of at least 66 2/3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Secured Notes of such series then outstanding (including, without limitation, consents
obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, such series of the Secured Notes)
shall be required.

A Secured Note does not cease to be outstanding because the Issuer or its respective Affiliates hold the
Secured Note; provided that in determining whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Secured Notes have given any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver under
the Secured Indenture, Secured Notes beneficially owned by the Issuer or its respective Affiliates shall be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any holder of Secured Notes, the Issuer, the
Guarantors and the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, may amend or supplement the Secured
Indenture, the Escrow Agreement, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements, the Secured Notes or the
Secured Note Guarantees:

(1) to cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency;

(2) to provide for uncertificated Secured Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Secured Notes;

(3) to provide for the assumption of the Issuer’s or any Guarantor’s obligations to holders of Secured
Notes and Secured Note Guarantees in the case of a merger, consolidation, amalgamation or Division or sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s or such
Guarantor’s assets, as applicable;

(4) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the holders of Secured
Notes or that does not adversely affect the rights under the Secured Indenture of any holder in any material respect;

(5) to comply with requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of
the Secured Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if applicable;

(6) to conform the text of the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes, the Secured Note Guarantees, the
Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreements or the Escrow Agreement to any provision of this “Description of
Secured Notes”;

(7) to provide for the issuance of Additional Secured Notes in accordance with the limitations set
forth in the Secured Indenture;

343


-----

(8) to allow any Guarantor to execute a supplemental indenture and/or a Secured Note Guarantee with
respect to the Secured Notes, the Security Documents or the Intercreditor Agreements in accordance with the terms
of the Secured Indenture;

(9) to add or release Secured Note Guarantees in accordance with the terms of the Secured Indenture
and to make, complete or confirm any grant of Collateral permitted or required by the Secured Indenture or any of
the Security Documents or Intercreditor Agreements, or any release of Collateral pursuant to the terms of the
Secured Indenture or any of the Security Documents or Intercreditor Agreements;

(10) to secure additional extensions of credit and add additional secured creditors holding other Parity
Lien Indebtedness so long as such Parity Lien Indebtedness is not prohibited by the provisions of the Secured
Indenture or any other then-existing Parity Lien Indebtedness; or

(11) to add additional assets as Collateral.

The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Secured Indenture to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. Until
an amendment or waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a holder is a continuing consent by such holder and
every subsequent holder of all or part of the related Note. Any such holder or subsequent holder may revoke such
consent as to its Secured Notes by written notice to the Trustee or the Issuer, received thereby before the date on
which holders of the requisite principal amount of Secured Notes have consented to such amendment or waiver.

In addition, the holders will be deemed to have consented for purposes of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements to any of the following amendments and other modifications to the Security Documents or
Intercreditor Agreements:

(1) (a) to add other parties (or any authorized agent thereof or trustee therefor) holding Parity Lien
Indebtedness that is incurred in compliance with the New ABL Credit Agreement, the New Term Loan Credit
Agreement, the Secured Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements and (b) to establish
that the Liens on any Collateral securing such Parity Lien Indebtedness shall be pari passu under the Pari Passu
Intercreditor Agreement with the Liens on such Collateral securing the Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the
Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor
Agreement in effect immediately prior to such amendment or other modification;

(2) to establish that the Liens on any Collateral securing any Indebtedness replacing the New Term
Loan Credit Agreement permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture shall be pari passu to the Liens on
such Collateral securing any Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Secured Note
Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior to
such amendment or other modification;

(3) to establish that the Liens on any Current Asset Collateral securing any Indebtedness replacing the
New ABL Credit Agreement permitted to be incurred under the Secured Indenture shall be senior to the Liens on
such Current Asset Collateral securing any Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the
Secured Note Guarantees, and that the Liens on any Fixed Asset Collateral securing any such Indebtedness shall be
junior to the Liens on such Fixed Asset Collateral securing any Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the
Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees, all on the terms provided for in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement
in effect immediately prior to such amendment or other modification; and

(4) upon any cancellation or termination of the New ABL Credit Agreement without a replacement
thereof, to establish that the Current Asset Collateral (in addition to the Fixed Asset Collateral) shall secure the
Obligations under the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes and the Secured Note Guarantees on a first-priority
basis, subject to the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement in effect immediately prior to such amendment
or other modification.

344


-----

For the avoidance of doubt, no amendment, waiver, modification or deletion of the provisions described
under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders” or any of the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants,”
shall be deemed to impair or affect any rights of holders of the Secured Notes to institute suit for the enforcement of
any payment on or with respect to, or to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, the
Secured Notes.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Secured Indenture, the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreements with respect to a Series
of Secured Notes will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all Secured Notes of such Series
issued thereunder (except for certain rights of the Trustee, which shall survive) and any Collateral then securing the
Secured Notes of such Series shall be automatically released, when:

(1) either:

(a) all Secured Notes of such Series that have been authenticated, except lost, stolen or destroyed Secured
Notes of such Series that have been replaced or paid and Secured Notes of such Series for whose payment money
has been deposited in trust and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or discharged from such trust, have been cancelled or
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or

(b) all such Secured Notes of such Series not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have
become due and payable, will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or have been called
for redemption or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for
the giving of a notice of redemption in the name and at the expense of the Issuer and the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee in a manner that is not revocable, (a) in the case
of the Dollar Secured Notes, (i) cash in U.S. dollars in an amount, (ii) non-callable U.S. dollar-denominated
Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and interest thereon will be in an amount, or (iii) a
combination thereof in an amount, or (b) in the case of the Euro Secured Notes, (i) cash in euro in an amount, (ii)
non-callable euro-denominated Government Securities, the scheduled payments of principal of and interest thereon
will be in an amount, or (iii) a combination thereof in an amount, in each case, as will be sufficient (in the case that
Government Securities have been deposited, in the opinion of a nationally recognized investment bank, appraisal

**Concerning the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent**

If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Issuer or any Guarantor, the Secured Indenture will contain
provisions that limit the right of the Trustee to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in
other transactions with the Issuer and the Guarantors; however, if it acquires any conflicting interest as defined in
the Trust Indenture Act it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to
continue as Trustee (if the Secured Indenture has been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act) or resign.

The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Secured Notes will have
the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to
the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, subject to certain exceptions. The Secured Indenture will provide that in
case an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its rights and
powers under the Secured Indenture, to use the same degree of care in their exercise as a prudent man would
exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, neither the
Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the
Secured Indenture at the request or direction of any holder of Secured Notes, unless such holder has offered, and if
requested, provided to the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity and/or security
satisfactory to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense.

Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be responsible for, and make no representation as
to the existence, genuineness, value or protection of, any Collateral, for the legality, effectiveness or sufficiency of
any Security Document or for the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any Liens securing the
Secured Notes. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall be responsible for filing any financing or
continuation statements or recording any documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or
otherwise perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any Lien or security interest in the Collateral.

By their acceptance of the Secured Notes, the holders of the Secured Notes will be deemed to have
authorized the Notes Collateral Agent to enter into and to perform each of the Security Documents and the
Intercreditor Agreements, including any amendments or supplements thereto permitted by the Secured Indenture.

**Maintenance of Listing**

After the Issue Date, the Issuer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the
listing of the Euro Secured Notes on the Exchange for so long as the Euro Secured Notes are outstanding; provided
that if the Issuer is unable to obtain admission to listing of the Euro Secured Notes on the Exchange or if at any time
the Issuer determines in its sole discretion that it will not maintain such listing, it will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (prior to the delisting of the Euro Secured Notes in the event that they were previously listed on
the Exchange) obtain a listing of the Euro Secured Notes on another “recognized stock exchange” as defined in
Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 of the United Kingdom (in which case, references in this covenant to the
Exchange will be deemed to be refer to such other “recognized stock exchange”). In no event will this covenant
require the Issuer to obtain or maintain the listing of the Euro Secured Notes on any exchange that requires financial
reporting for any fiscal period in addition to the fiscal periods required by the Commission.

**Governing Law; Jury Trial Waiver**

The Secured Indenture will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. The Security Documents will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York; however, the mortgages will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the state in which the applicable Premises is located. The Secured
Indenture provides that the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee, and each holder of a Secured Note by its
acceptance thereof, irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by
jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to the Secured Indenture, the Secured Notes or any transaction
contemplated thereby.

Act. The Secured Indenture will accordingly not be subject to the Trust Indenture Act, and may not contain
provisions corresponding or similar to certain provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that would otherwise apply if the

**BOOK-ENTRY, DELIVERY AND FORM**

Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers (“QIBs”) in reliance on
Rule 144A (the “Rule 144A Notes”) under the Securities Act will be initially represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Rule 144A Global Notes”). On the
Issue Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Dollar Secured Notes and the Rule 144A Global Note
representing the Dollar Unsecured Notes (together, the Dollar Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon
issuance with the custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue
Date, the Rule 144A Global Note representing the Euro Secured Notes and the Rule 144A Global Note representing
the Euro Unsecured Notes (together, the “Euro Rule 144A Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with a
common depositary (the “Common Depositary”) for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the
name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Each series of Notes sold outside the United States to non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions outside the
United States in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act will be initially represented by one or more global
notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (collectively, the “Regulation S Global Notes” and,
together with the Rule 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Note
representing the Dollar Secured Notes and the Regulation S Global Note representing the Dollar Unsecured Notes
(together, the “Dollar Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. On the Issue Date, the Regulation S Global Note
representing the Euro Secured Notes and the Regulation S Global Note representing the Euro Unsecured Notes
(together, the “Euro Regulation S Global Notes”) will be deposited upon issuance with the Common Depositary for
the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the Common Depositary.

Ownership of interests in the Rule 144A Global Notes (the “Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests”) and in the
Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC, in the case of the
Dollar Global Notes, and Euroclear and/or Clearstream, in the case of the Euro Global Notes, or persons that hold
interests such participants or otherwise in accordance with applicable transfer restrictions set forth in the Indentures
and any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained
in the book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their respective participants, as applicable. The
Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and minimum denominations of
€100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Global Notes).

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with
the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive
certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners or
“holders” of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the custodian for DTC or the Common Depositary for
Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered to be the sole holders
of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests, to
transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the relevant Indenture.

Neither the Issuer nor any Trustee will have any responsibility, or be liable, for any aspect of the records
relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

391


-----

**Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered Notes
in certificated form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) if:

      - DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue
as depositary for the Global Notes, and we fail to appoint a successor; or

      - the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through either
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, following an event of default under the relevant
Indenture.

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that upon request by an owner of a Book-Entry
Interest, its current procedure is to request that the Issuer issues or causes to be issued Notes in definitive registered
form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of
the owner(s) of the Book-Entry Interest and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of
DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and
based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and
such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend set forth in “Notice to Investors,” unless that legend
is not required by the Indentures or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuer, the Trustees, the paying agents, the registrar and the transfer
agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Global Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person
will be liable for treating the registered holder as such. Ownership of the Global Notes will be evidenced through
registration from time to time at the registered office of the Issuer or as otherwise provided in the relevant Indenture,
and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

In the case of the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes, the holder of a Definitive Registered Note may
transfer such Note by surrendering it to the Registrar. In the event of a partial transfer or a partial redemption of a
holding of Definitive Registered Notes represented by one Definitive Registered Note, a Definitive Registered Note
will be issued to the transferee in respect of the part transferred, and a new Definitive Registered Note in respect of
the balance of the holding not transferred or redeemed will be issued to the transferor or the holder, as applicable;
provided that a Definitive Registered Note will only be issued in denominations of $200,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a Definitive Registered Note relating to the Dollar Notes) and
minimum denominations of €100,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of a
Definitive Registered Note relating to the Euro Notes).

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are
surrendered to the Registrar or at the office of the applicable Transfer Agent, we will issue and the relevant Trustee
(or its appointed agent) will authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the Trustee’s and our
requirements are met. We or the relevant Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of a Definitive
Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the relevant Trustee and us to
protect us, the Trustees, the applicable paying agent and the registrar appointed pursuant to the relevant Indenture
from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. We may charge for the
expenses of replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

If any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the relevant
Indenture, we in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or purchase
such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

392


-----

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only in accordance with the Indentures and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the applicable
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note (or any portion thereof) is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominees), as applicable, will redeem an equal amount of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The Common Depositary
will surrender such Global Note to the Registrar for cancellation or, in the case of a partial redemption, the Common
Depositary will request the Registrar or the Trustees to mark down, endorse and return the applicable Global Note to
reflect the reduction in the principal amount of such Global Note as a result of such partial redemption. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the
amount received by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such
Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, if fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will
credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by
lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with their respective operational
procedures; provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than $200,000 principal amount (in the case of
the Dollar Global Notes) and €100,000 principal amount (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) at maturity may be
redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, if any,
interest and additional interest, if any) will be made by the Issuer to the paying agents, which will in turn make such
payments to DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, which will distribute such payments to participants
in accordance with their customary procedures.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuer, the Trustees, the registrar, the transfer agents and the paying
agents will treat the registered holders of the Global Notes (i.e., DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or their
respective nominees), as applicable) as the owners thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuer, the Trustees, the registrar, the transfer agents or the paying agents or any
of our or their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

      - any aspect of the records of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, or any participant
or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest or for
maintaining, supervising or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made on account of, a
Book-Entry Interest;

      - any other matters relating to the actions and practices of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as
applicable, or any participant or indirect participant; or

      - the records of the custodian or Common Depositary, as applicable.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants.

Payments will be subject in all cases to any fiscal or other laws and regulations (including any regulations
of the applicable clearing system) applicable thereto. None of the Issuer, the Trustees, the paying agents, the transfer
agents, the registrar or the Initial Purchasers nor any of our or their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a
Global Note or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any

393


-----

currency conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment. Holders may be subject to foreign
exchange risks that may have economic and tax consequences to them.

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interests in such Notes through DTC in U.S. dollars. The principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Euro Global Notes will be paid to
holders of interests in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in euro.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of Notes (including the presentation of Notes for exchange as described above) only at the direction of one or
more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of
such portion of the aggregate principal amount of Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have
given such direction. DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default
under the Notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the Notes, reserves the
right to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes, and to distribute such Definitive Registered
Notes to its participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures
of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their respective direct or indirect participants, which rules and procedures
may change from time to time. If a holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any
reason, including to sell Notes to persons in states that require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal
procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indentures.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements discussed in “Notice to
Investors.”

Restricted Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
Regulation S Book-Entry Interest only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S or
Rule 144A under the Securities Act or any other exemption (if available) under the Securities Act.

Subject to the foregoing, and as set forth in “Notice to Investors,” Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
and exchanged as described under “Description of the Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of
the Unsecured Notes—Transfer and Exchange.” Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note of the same
denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a
Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such
a Book-Entry Interest.

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a Book-Entry Interest in any other Global Note of the same denomination will, upon transfer, cease to be a
Book-Entry Interest in the first-mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in such other Global Note
and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it remains such a Book-Entry Interest.

394


-----

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and “Description of the
Unsecured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers to the relevant
Trustee and the Registrar a written certificate (in the form provided in the relevant Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Notices**

So long as the Global Notes are held on behalf of a clearing system, notices required to be given to
noteholders may be given by their being delivered to that clearing system and will be deemed to have been given to
the noteholders on the date of delivery to such clearing system.

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are
provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the
respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. None of us, the Trustees, the paying agents, the
registrar, the transfer agents or the Initial Purchaser take any responsibility for these operations or procedures and
we urge investors to contact the systems or their participants directly to discuss these matters.

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, the trustees, the paying
agents, the transfer agents, the registrar nor any of their respective agents are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking
Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve
System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing
agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides
asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market
instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement
amongst direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic
computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned
subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC,
National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered
clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also
available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and
clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly
or indirectly.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants,
including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded
securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream
participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies
and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as
banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear
and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some

395


-----

jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests
through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global
Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately
available funds.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in euro. Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or
Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form.
Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the
business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that
settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Notes through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems are open
for business.

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may
find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or
in Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following discussion is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes issued pursuant to this offering, but does not purport to be a complete
analysis of all potential U.S. federal income tax effects. The effects of U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not
discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of
the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing
interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could
adversely affect a holder. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters
discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a position contrary to that discussed
below regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

This discussion is limited to Notes held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code
(generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to Notes purchased for cash at
original issue and at their “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which
a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash (other than sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar
persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers)). This discussion
does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including
the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the impact of the requirement under
Section 451(b) of the Code on certain holders to conform the timing of income accruals with respect to the Notes to
such holders’ applicable financial statements. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders
subject to special rules, including, without limitation:

  - former U.S. citizens or former long-term residents of the United States;

  - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

  - U.S. Holders (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar;

  - U.S. Holders that hold their Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries;

  - persons holding Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion
transaction or other integrated investment;

  - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions;

  - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies;

  - brokers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies;

  - traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;

  - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that
accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax;

  - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or S corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
investors therein);

  - tax-exempt entities or governmental entities; and

  - persons deemed to sell Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

397


-----

If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the
tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of such
partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, any entity or arrangement treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes considering an investment in the Notes and the partners in such
partnership should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them.

**THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TAX ADVICE.**
**PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE**
**APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS**
**AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF**
**THE NOTES ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (INCLUDING ESTATE AND GIFT**
**TAX LAWS), UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAXING JURISDICTION OR**
**UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.**

**Effect of Certain Contingencies**

In certain circumstances, the Issuer may be obligated to pay amounts with respect to the Notes in excess of
the stated interest and principal payable on the Notes, or to make payments on the Notes in advance of their
scheduled dates (see e.g., “Description of Unsecured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”
and “Description of Secured Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption”). These obligations may
implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” Although the
issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the Notes should not be treated as
contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination will be binding on a holder unless such holder explicitly
discloses on a statement attached to the holder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the
acquisition date of the Notes that such holder’s determination is different. Our determination, however, is not
binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenges this position, and the Notes are treated as contingent payment
debt instruments because of such contingencies, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation might, among other
things, be required to accrue interest income on the Notes at a higher rate than the stated rate of interest on the Notes
and to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as
capital gain. This discussion assumes that the Notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible application of the
contingent payment debt instrument rules to the Notes.

**Effect of Escrow Release and Related Transactions**

As described in “Description of Unsecured Notes” and “Description of Secured Notes” if this offering
closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross
proceeds from the sale of the Notes into segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. If the
Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Notes will be released from escrow
and become guaranteed by the Guarantors. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position,
and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the release of the proceeds and guarantee should not result in a
taxable event to holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this position is respected, a holder subject to U.S.
federal income taxation would not recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions. It is
possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view and seek to treat such holders as exchanging the Notes
for “new” Notes in a deemed exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully asserted that
position (and a deemed exchange failed to qualify as a recapitalization), as described in more detail below under
“Tax Consequences Applicable to U.S. Holders - Sale or Other Taxable Disposition” and “Tax Consequences
Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders – Sale or Other Taxable Disposition” such holders would be required to recognize
any gain or loss in connection with such exchange and would have a new holding period and a new tax basis in the
“new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S.
federal income tax consequences to them of the transactions related to the release of the escrow proceeds.

**Tax Consequences Applicable to U.S. Holders**

**_Definition of a U.S. Holder_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, is or is treated as:

  - an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

  - a corporation created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof, or the District of
Columbia;

  - an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or

  - a trust that (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a U.S. court over its administration and with respect
to which one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code)
have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (2) has a valid election in effect to be treated
as a United States person for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

**_Stated Interest_**

Subject to the special rules discussed below with respect to foreign currency, stated interest on a Note
generally will be taxable to a U.S. Holder as ordinary income at the time such interest is received or accrued, in
accordance with such U.S. Holder’s regular method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

U.S. Holders of Euro Notes will be subject to additional rules relating to the receipt of foreign currency. A
U.S. Holder of Euro Notes that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income the
U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest payment on the Euro Notes (including any amounts received
upon the Disposition (as defined below) of a Euro Note that are attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest)
based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into
U.S. dollars on such date. Such a cash-method U.S. Holder generally will not recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment on the Euro Notes.

A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on the Euro Notes
in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on:

  - The average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof within the taxable
year, in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year; or

  - At such U.S. Holder’s election, the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or in the
case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year, the last day of the portion of the accrual
period within each taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the
last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt
instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

Such a U.S. Holder using the accrual method of tax accounting will recognize foreign currency exchange
gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment equal to the difference (if any) between (i) the value of the euros
received as interest, as translated into U.S. dollars using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt and (ii) the
U.S. dollar amount previously included in income with respect to such payment. Such foreign currency exchange
gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss but generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest
income received on the Euro Notes.

399


-----

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition_**

Subject to the special rules discussed below with respect to foreign currency, a U.S. Holder will generally
recognize gain or loss on a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (a
“Disposition”) equal to the difference, if any, between the amount received for the Note in cash or other property
valued at fair market value (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable
as interest to the extent not previously included in taxable income) and the U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note. Subject to the discussion of foreign currency gain or loss with respect to Euro Notes below, any gain or loss
will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more
than one year at the time of the Disposition and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital
gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at a reduced rate.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Dollar Note generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. Holder
paid for the Dollar Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Euro Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro
purchase price, as applicable, calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase.

If there is a Disposition of a Euro Note for an amount denominated in euro, a U.S. Holder’s amount
realized generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euro received in such Disposition (less any amounts
attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously
included in taxable income), calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of the Disposition. If the
Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market (as determined under applicable Treasury regulations), a
cash-method U.S. Holder is required to determine the U.S. dollar value of the euro received in such Disposition by
translating the euro received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the Disposition, and an accrualmethod U.S. Holder may elect the same treatment for the euro received. This election by accrual-method U.S.
Holders must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be
changed without the consent of the IRS.

A U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss upon the Disposition of a Euro Note as a result
of fluctuations in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Gain or loss attributable to such fluctuations will equal the
difference (if any) between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price of the Euro Note,
determined using the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder acquired the Euro Note, and (ii) the U.S.
dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price in euro of the Euro Note, determined using the spot rate of exchange
on the date of the Disposition of the Euro Note (or, possibly in the case of a cash-method U.S. Holder or an electing
accrual-method U.S. Holder, if the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market (as determined under
applicable Treasury regulations), the spot rates of exchange on the settlement date of such Disposition). The foreign
currency gain or loss (together with any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to accrued but unpaid stated
interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the Disposition
of the Euro Note. Any such foreign currency gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or loss.

**_Transactions in Euros_**

Euros received as interest on, or on a Disposition of, the Euro Notes, as applicable, will generally have a
tax basis equal to their U.S. dollar value at the time such amount is received. The amount of gain or loss recognized
on a Disposition of such euros will be equal to the difference between (1) the amount of U.S. dollars, or the fair
market value in U.S. dollars of the other property received in such Disposition, and (2) the U.S. Holder’s adjusted
tax basis in such euros. Any such gain or loss generally will be ordinary income or loss.

A U.S. Holder that purchases the Euro Notes with previously owned euros will generally recognize gain or
loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between such U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in such euros and the
U.S. dollar fair market value of such Euro Notes on the date of purchase. Any such gain or loss generally will be
ordinary income or loss and will not be treated as interest income or expense. The conversion of U.S. dollars to
euros and the immediate use of such euros to purchase the Euro Notes generally will not result in any exchange gain
or loss for a U.S. Holder.

400


-----

**_Reportable Transaction Reporting_**

Under applicable Treasury regulations, a U.S. Holder who participates in a “reportable transaction”(as
defined in the Treasury regulations) must attach to its U.S. federal income tax return a disclosure statement on IRS
Form 8886. Under the relevant rules, a U.S. Holder may be required to treat a foreign currency exchange loss from
the Euro Notes as a reportable transaction if this loss exceeds the relevant threshold in the Treasury regulations. U.S.
Holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the tax reporting obligations, if any, including any
requirement to file IRS Form 8886, with respect to the ownership or Disposition of the Euro Notes or any related
transaction such as the receipt of stated interest or a Disposition of any euros received in respect of the Euro Notes
and the substantial penalties for non-compliance.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

A U.S. Holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding on payments of stated
interest on a Note or proceeds from the Disposition of a Note. Certain U.S. Holders are exempt from backup
withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S. Holder will be subject to backup
withholding (currently at a rate of 24%) if such holder is not otherwise exempt and:

  - the holder fails to furnish the holder’s taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily
his or her social security number;

  - the holder furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;

  - the applicable withholding agent is notified by the IRS that the holder has become subject to backup
withholding because such holder previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or

  - the holder fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer
identification number and that the IRS has not notified the holder that the holder is subject to backup
withholding.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their
qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.

**Tax Consequences Applicable to Non-U.S. Holders**

**_Definition of a Non-U.S. Holder_**

For purposes of this discussion, a “Non-U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a U.S. Holder.

**_Payments of Interest_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, interest paid on a Note to a Non-U.S.
Holder that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United
States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax provided that:

  - the Non-U.S. Holder does not, actually or constructively, own stock possessing 10% or more of the total
combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of the Issuer;

  - the Non-U.S. Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Issuer through actual or
constructive stock ownership; and

401


-----

  - either (1) the Non-U.S. Holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent under
penalties of perjury that it is not a United States person and provides its name and address; (2) a securities
clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary
course of its trade or business and holds the Note on behalf of the Non-U.S. Holder certifies to the
applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the financial institution between it and the
Non-U.S. Holder, has received from the Non-U.S. Holder a statement under penalties of perjury that such
holder is not a United States person and provides a copy of such statement to the applicable withholding
agent; or (3) the Non-U.S. Holder holds its Note directly through a “qualified intermediary” (within the
meaning of applicable Treasury regulations) and certain conditions are satisfied.

If a Non-U.S. Holder does not satisfy the requirements above, interest paid on a Note to a Non-U.S. Holder
that is not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States
will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless the Non-U.S. Holder is entitled to a reduction in or an
exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable income tax treaty. To claim such
entitlement, the Non-U.S. Holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form
W-8 BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from
withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax treaty between the United States and the country in which the
Non-U.S. Holder resides or is established.

If interest paid to a Non-U.S. Holder is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade
or business within the United States, the Non-U.S. Holder will generally be exempt from U.S. federal withholding
tax, unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. To claim the exemption, the Non-U.S. Holder must
furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI (or other applicable documentation),
certifying that interest paid on a Note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the
Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States.

Any effectively connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income
basis at the regular graduated rates, in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder, unless an
applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a
branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on its effectively
connected earnings and profits, as adjusted for certain items.

The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to the
payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. Holders that do not timely provide the applicable
withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for an exemption from withholding, or a reduced
rate of withholding, under an applicable income tax treaty, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by
timely filing a valid claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding
their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.

**_Sale or Other Taxable Disposition_**

Subject to the discussion of backup withholding and FATCA below, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not
be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding tax on any gain recognized upon a sale, exchange, redemption,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note (a “Disposition”) (excluding any amount allocable to accrued and
unpaid interest, which generally will be treated as interest subject to the rules discussed above in “—Payments of
Interest”) unless:

  - the gain is effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the
United States; or

  - the Non-U.S. Holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more
during the taxable year of the Disposition and certain other requirements are met.

Any gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a
net income basis at the regular graduated rates, in the same manner as if the Non-U.S. Holder were a U.S. Holder,

402


-----

unless an applicable income tax treaty provides otherwise. A Non-U.S. Holder that is a corporation also may be
subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on
its effectively connected earnings and profits, as adjusted for certain items.

Any gain described in the second bullet point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of
30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), but may be offset by certain U.S. source
capital losses of the Non-U.S. Holder, if any (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United
States), provided the Non-U.S. Holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.

Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax treaties that may
provide for different rules.

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

Payments of interest generally will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the Non-U.S. Holder
certifies its non-U.S. status as described above under “—Payments of Interest.” However, information returns are
required to be filed with the IRS with respect to any interest paid to the Non-U.S. Holder, regardless of whether any
tax was actually withheld.

Proceeds of the Disposition of a Note may be subject to backup withholding and/or information reporting,
unless the applicable withholding agent receives the statement described above or the holder otherwise establishes
an exemption. However, a Disposition of a Note paid outside the United States and conducted through a non-U.S.
office of a non-U.S. broker without certain specified connections to the United States generally will not be subject to
backup withholding or information reporting.

Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions
of an applicable treaty or agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is
established.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules
may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a Non-U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the
required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_FATCA_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code and related U.S. Treasury guidance, commonly known
as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), interest on the Notes received by non-U.S. financial
institutions and certain non-U.S. non-financial entities (including, in some instances, where such an institution or
entity is acting as an intermediary) may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at the rate of 30% unless, in each
case, such institutions and entities satisfy certain reporting, compliance and withholding requirements. An
intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these
requirements.

Under proposed Treasury regulations, gross proceeds from a sale or other taxable disposition of Notes
(including a retirement or redemption of Notes) are not subject to FATCA withholding. In its preamble to such
proposed Treasury regulations, the IRS has stated that taxpayers may generally rely on the proposed Treasury
regulations until final Treasury regulations are issued.

Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding
under FATCA to their investment in the Notes.

403


-----

**CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the acquisition of the Notes by
employee benefit plans that are subject to Title I of the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), plans, individual retirement accounts and other arrangements that are subject to Section 4975
of the Code or provisions under any other federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are similar
to such provisions of ERISA or the Code (collectively, “Similar Laws”), and entities whose underlying assets are
considered to include “plan assets” of any such plan, account or arrangement pursuant to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3101, as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA, or any Similar Law (each, a “Plan”).

**General Fiduciary Matters**

ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an
ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises
any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or
disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation
to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the
ERISA Plan.

Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel
regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited
transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm
that such acquisition and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other
violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or whether an exemption would be applicable to any such purchase
of Notes. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should
determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including,
without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of
ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any Guarantors or any of
their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan
with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide
impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary
capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and
materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not
directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment
in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each
prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.

**Prohibited Transaction Issues**

Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified
transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of
ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available.
Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed
present. The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things,
whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan
and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and
a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or
disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without
limitation, the Issuer the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified
person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and
liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt
prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or

404


-----

holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an initial purchaser or a Guarantor is
considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited
transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is
held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption.

In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”)
that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or
holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions
determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled
separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance
company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers,
although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. In addition to
the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code exempt certain transactions
between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or
an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any
investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction) solely by reason of
providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no
more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not,
however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that
even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these
exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the
fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any
other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable.
There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.

Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code,
may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a
governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its
counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if
necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the
Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or
holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or violation of
any applicable Similar Laws.

The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be
construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons
involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons
considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with
their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such
investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes.

Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the
Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules
of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws. Neither we nor the initial purchasers make any representation as to
whether an investment in the Notes is appropriate for any Plan in general or whether such investment is appropriate
for any particular Plan.

**Representation**

Accordingly, by the acquisition and/or holding of a Note, or any interest in a Note, each purchaser and
subsequent transferee will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) such purchaser or subsequent
transferee is not acquiring or holding the Notes for or on behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by such
purchaser or transferee to acquire or hold the Note, or any interest therein, constitutes assets of, any Plan or (ii)(a)
the acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Note by such purchaser or transferee will not constitute a
non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation

405


-----

under any applicable Similar Laws and (b) none of the Transaction Parties is a fiduciary to such purchaser or
transferee or is undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with
respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes.

        - unless so registered, the Notes and the related guarantees may not be offered, sold or
otherwise transferred except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, and in
each case in compliance with the conditions for transfer set forth in paragraph (5) below.

Securities Act) of ours, that you are not acting on our behalf and that you are either:

you are relying only on this offering memorandum in making your investment decision with respect to the Notes.
You agree that you have had access to such financial and other information concerning us and the Notes as you have

(5) You represent that you are purchasing the Notes for your own account, or for one or more investor

that the disposition of your property or the property of that investor account or accounts be at all times within your

property of an investor account or accounts be at all times within the seller or account’s control and to compliance
with any applicable state securities laws. You will notify any subsequent purchaser, and each subsequent purchaser
is required to notify any subsequent purchaser from it, of the resale restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence.

You also acknowledge that to the extent that you hold the Notes through an interest in a global note, the
Resale Restriction Period (as defined below) may continue until one year after the Issuer, or any affiliate of the
Issuer, was the owner of such note or an interest in such global note, and so may continue indefinitely.

(6) You also acknowledge that:

last date that we or any of our affiliates was the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the
Notes or 40 days (in the case of Regulation S notes) after the later of the Issue Date of the
Notes offered hereby and when the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes are first offered to
persons other than distributors (as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S) in reliance on
Regulation S (the “Resale Restriction Period”), and will not apply after the applicable Resale
Restriction Period ends;

        - we and the Trustee reserve the right to require in connection with any offer, sale or other
transfer of Notes under clauses (d) and (e) above the delivery of an opinion of counsel,
certifications and/or other information satisfactory to us and the Trustee; and

        - each Note will contain a legend substantially to the following effect:

BY ITS ACQUISITION OF THIS SECURITY, THE HOLDER THEREOF WILL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE REPRESENTED AND WARRANTED THAT EITHER (1) THE

behalf of, and no portion of the assets used by you to acquire or hold the Notes, or any interest therein, constitutes

constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar

409

violation under any applicable Similar Law and (b) none of the Transaction Parties is your fiduciary, or is
undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the
decision to purchase or hold the Notes.

qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR.

(11) You understand and acknowledge that:

(a) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should
not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any “retail investor” in the EEA (as defined in
paragraph 9 above) or any “retail investor” in the United Kingdom (as defined in paragraph 10 above);

The purchase agreement provides that the obligations of the initial purchasers are subject to certain
conditions precedent and that the initial purchasers are committed, severally and not jointly, to take and pay for all
of the Notes, if any are taken. If an initial purchaser defaults, the purchase agreement provides that the purchase
commitments of the non-defaulting initial purchasers may be increased or the purchase agreement may be
terminated. The Issuer and the guarantors have agreed, to indemnify the initial purchasers against certain liabilities
in connection with this offering, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and to contribute to payments that the
initial purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

**Commissions and Discounts**

We have been advised by the initial purchasers that they initially propose to offer and sell each series of the
Notes at the applicable offering price set forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum. If all of the Notes of
a series are not sold at the applicable initial offering price, the initial purchasers may change the applicable offering
price and other selling terms without notice. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their
affiliates or other registered broker-dealers or selling agents.

411


-----

**Notes Are Not Being Registered**

The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities law and
may not be offered or sold except as set forth above. The initial purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in
transactions not requiring registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales
pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The initial purchasers will not offer or sell the
Notes except to persons they reasonably believe to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A, or
pursuant to offers and sales to non-U.S. persons that occur outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S under the Securities Act. Each purchaser of the Notes offered hereby in making its purchase will be
deemed to have made by its purchase certain acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set
forth under “Notice to Investors.”

In connection with sales outside of the United States, the initial purchasers have agreed that they will not
offer, sell or deliver the Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as a part of the initial purchasers’
distribution at any time or (2) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering or the date
the Notes are originally issued. The initial purchasers will send to each dealer to whom they sell such Notes in
reliance on Regulation S during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on
offers and sales of the Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons. Terms
used in this paragraph have the meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities Act.

In addition, until the expiration of the Restricted Period referred to in “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form,” an
offer or sale of the Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this offering) may
violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance
with Rule 144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

**New Issue of Notes**

Each series of the Notes will be a new issue of notes for which there is currently no public trading market.
The Issuer does not intend to list the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. The
Issuer intends to apply to list each series of Euro Notes on the Exchange following the consummation of this
offering. There is no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if
listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained.
Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining
such listing or admission to trading. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that following the completion
of this offering, they presently intend to make a market in each series of the Notes after the completion of the
offering. They are not obligated to do so, however, and any market-making activities with respect to any series of
the Notes may be discontinued at any time without any notice. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance as to the
development of any market or the liquidity of any market for any series of the Notes. If an active trading market for
any series of the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of such series of Notes may be adversely
affected. If any series of the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, or our operating performance and financial
condition, general economic conditions and other factors. Also, the offering of each series of the Notes by the initial
purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole
or in part.

**Price Stabilization and Short Positions**

In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or
otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the initial purchasers may overallot this offering, creating a
syndicate short position. The initial purchasers may bid for and purchase the Notes in the open market to cover
syndicate short positions. In addition, the initial purchasers may bid for and purchase the Notes in the open market to
stabilize the price of the Notes. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Notes above the
price that would otherwise exist in the open market. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any
representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may
have on the price of the Notes. In addition, neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation that

412


-----

the representatives will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
discontinued without notice.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

We have agreed that we will not, for a period of 90 days after the date of this offering memorandum,
without first obtaining the prior written consent of the representatives, directly or indirectly, issue, sell, offer to
contract or grant any option to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of, any debt securities or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into debt securities, except for the Notes sold to the initial purchasers pursuant to the
purchase agreement.

**Other Relationships**

The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, investment banking and commercial banking, financial advisory,
lending, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage
activities. Certain of the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed,
currently perform, and may in the future perform, various financial advisory and investment banking services for us,
for which they have received customary compensation and may provide such services and receive customary
compensation in the future. Certain of the relationships involve transactions that are material to us or our affiliates
and for which the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have received significant fees.

An affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. will act as administrative agent under the New Credit Facilities and, in
each case, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates will act as joint bookrunners, joint lead arrangers,
agents and/or lenders for the New Credit Facilities and will be entitled to receive customary fees in connection
therewith. Affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers may also participate in the offering of the Notes. In addition,
an affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. is administrative agent and collateral agent under the Sigura Existing Credit
Agreements and certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates are lenders under the Sigura Existing Credit
Agreements and/or the Solenis Existing Credit Agreements and will be entitled to receive customary fees in
connection therewith and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to repay such
indebtedness. In addition, the initial purchasers or their affiliates have made commitments to us with respect to a
senior secured bridge facility and a senior unsecured bridge facility to finance a portion of the Acquisition. These
commitments under such bridge facilities will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross cash proceeds
of this offering. An affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. is acting as sell-side financial advisor to Solenis LLC in
connection with the Acquisition and will receive customary fees in connection therewith.

In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective
affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related
derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their respective customers and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of
the Issuer. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold,
or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. In addition,
certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may be lenders, agents or managers for the lenders
under the Sigura Existing Credit Agreements and/or the Solenis Existing Credit Agreements, as applicable, each of
which is being repaid in full and terminated (other than the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement, which will
remain in place following the consummation of the Transactions), in part with the net proceeds of the Notes, in
connection with the Transactions and as such, such initial purchasers and/or their affiliates will receive a portion of
the net proceeds of the Notes.

If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial
purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge,
and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with
their customary risk management policies. Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such
exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of

413


-----

short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or
short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

**Settlement**

We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about the date specified
on the cover of this offering memorandum, which will be the     business day following the date of this offering
memorandum (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+     ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act,
trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two
business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle in
T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement.
Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade the Notes during such period should consult their own advisors.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the European Economic Area**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a
person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as
amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the
“Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in
point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS Regulation. This
offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State of the EEA will
be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”)
from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for
the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.

The above selling restriction is in addition to any other selling restrictions set out below.

**Notice to Prospective Investors in the United Kingdom**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act
2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (as amended, the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (“UK
MiFIR”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of
UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be
unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer
of Notes in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it
forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) and the FSMA from the
requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the
purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation or the FSMA.

This document is for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to
investments and who qualify as investment professionals within the meaning of Article 19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”),
(ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”)

of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) in connection with the
issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such
persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). This document is directed only at relevant persons and
must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to
which this document relates is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.

**_UK MiFIR Product Governance / Professional Investors and ECPs only Target Market_**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties,
as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK
MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are
appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into
consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook
Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and
determining appropriate distribution channels.

##### Consolidated Financial Statements As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and for the Years Ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018


-----

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Board of Directors of Solenis UK International Limited

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Solenis UK International
Limited and its subsidiaries, which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2020
and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive (loss), of changes in
shareholders' (deficit) equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
2020.

**_Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements_**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes
the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.

**_Auditors’ Responsibility_**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in
the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to
fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company's
preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of
the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient
and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

**_Opinion_**

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of Solenis UK International Limited and its subsidiaries as of September 30, 2020 and
2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
September 30, 2020 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

 Note 1  Business Background

 General Description of the Business

 Solenis UK International Limited ("Solenis" or "the Company") is domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the "UK"). The Company was formed on August 31, 2018 for the specific purpose of consummating a Joint Venture (the "Joint Venture", "JV", or "JVFA") between BASF SE ("BASF") a German- based chemical manufacturer and distributor, and the Solenis business, which was 97% owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R") and 3% owned by management immediately prior to the JV.

 Prior to the formation of the Company, the Solenis business existed under the name Solenis International LLC (formerly a limited liability company known as CD&R Seahawk Bidco, LLC and a limited partnership known as Solenis International, L.P.) ("International"), a Delaware limited liability company. International was formed on February 14, 2014 and was domiciled in the Netherlands. International and certain other holding companies and partnerships (the "Holding Companies") were formed by affiliates of CD&R. The Holding Companies, collectively, were formed for the purpose of acquiring the business of Ashland Water Technologies ("AWT"), a business formerly owned by Ashland, Inc. ("Ashland"), including certain assets of AWT and all of the capital stock and equity interests of certain entities engaged in the AWT business from Ashland. International, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired AWT on July 31, 2014 for $1,734.8 million (the “Acquisition”). The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash, cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above. The Company’s global operations are conducted by wholly-owned subsidiaries.

 Immediately prior to the JV, CD&R, alongside members of the International management team, controlled 100% of the equity interests and voting rights in the Holding Companies and International. To consummate the JV, CD&R and members of the International management team sold their collective interests in International and the Holding Companies to Solenis in exchange for a 51% interest in the JV, represented by a 51% equity interest in Solenis UK International Limited, or Solenis. Historically, the combined and consolidated financial statements of the Solenis business were presented at the level of International. International was the subsidiary of Solenis Holdings I Coöperatief U.A., a Dutch-domiciled holding company owned collectively by CD&R and members of the International management team. As both Solenis and Solenis Holdings I Coöperatief U.A. shared the same ultimate parent in CD&R, this transaction was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common control, as described under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations. In accordance with this guidance, net assets acquired maintained their predecessor values and were not assessed for or recorded at fair value.

 On January 31, 2019, BASF conveyed $678 million to Solenis in consideration of a 49% interest in the JV, represented by a 49% equity interest in Solenis UK International Limited, or Solenis. The Company subsequently contributed the $678 million of proceeds to its subsidiaries. One such subsidiary, Solenis Holdings LLC, a US- domiciled limited liability company, obtained third party debt financing proceeds of $525 million, of which $213 million was either loaned or contributed to subsidiaries of the Company and Solenis Holdings LLC. In the aggregate, the subsidiaries of the Company entered into various local asset transfer agreements with BASF through which Solenis acquired the assets of the BASF Paper and Water Chemicals Business in exchange for $891.3 million, less working capital adjustments. Through the various transactions executed on January 31, 2019, BASF sold the assets of its former Paper and Water Chemicals Business to Solenis in consideration of $891.3 million, comprised of a 49% equity interest in the Company and $213 million in cash subject to working capital adjustments. The final agreed upon purchase price was $881.7 million, inclusive of working capital adjustments.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 As of January 31, 2019, the Company was owned by CD&R (49.5%), BASF (49%) and members of the JV management team (1.5%).

 Basis of Presentation

 Our consolidated financial statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Solenis; including all Holding Companies. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

 Nature of Operations

 Solenis is a leading supplier of specialty chemicals and services to the pulp and paper, mining, food and beverage, power generation, refining, chemical processing, general manufacturing and municipal markets. It offers chemical and equipment technologies and services designed to help customers improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect plant assets and minimize environmental impact.

 The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributed to Solenis.

 To meet the diverse requirements of its customers, Solenis offers a range of services, including start-up and ongoing applications support, analytical and applications laboratories and customized program offerings.

 Solenis’ products include biocides, cleaners, coagulants and flocculants, converting additives, corrosion inhibitors, defoamers, deposit control agents, food and beverage processing aids, internal and surface size agents, membrane treatments, mining and mineral processing aids, monitoring and control systems, odor inhibitors and neutralizers, oxygen scavengers, polyacrylamides, pulp mill additives, retention, drainage and clarification aids, scale inhibitors, sludge dewatering polymers, surface treatments, tissue making additives, wet- and dry-strength additives, colorants, surface size, antiscalants for desalination, and wood adhesives.

 Solenis has 40 manufacturing facilities in 18 countries. Solenis markets and distributes its products and services directly and through third-party distributors in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.

 Solenis’ business principally consists of three operating segments: Pulp & Paper, Industrial Water, and Reverse Supply Agreements. A brief description for each of these operating segments are as follows:

 Pulp & Paper – The Pulp & Paper ("P&P") business manufactures and sells a broad array of process chemistry for the pulp and paper industry including deposit and scale control agents, defoamers, biocides, retention aids and crepe and release additives. These products are designed to deliver benefits such as enhanced operational efficiencies, system cleanliness and superior performance in a wide variety of manufacturing operations globally. In addition, the Pulp & Paper business offers functional chemistry for packaging, tissue and towel, and printing and writing producers that impart specific properties such as wet or dry strength, colorants, surface size, liquid holdout and printing ability to the final paper or board. Products and technologies include internal and surface sizing agents and wet and dry strength additives. Pulp & Paper’s sales represented 64%, 65%, and 70% of total sales for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

 Industrial Water – The Industrial Water ("IWT") business offers specialized chemicals for the utility water treatment market including influent water, boiler water, cooling water and effluent water treatments.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 extraction and scale and corrosion inhibitors for mining and mineral processing, food processing, oil refining, chemicals processing and general manufacturing markets. Industrial Water’s sales represented 31%, 32%, and 30% of total sales for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

 Reverse Supply Agreements - On January 31, 2019, as part of the JV, Solenis agreed to provide certain finished goods to BASF at below-market prices, consistent with BASF's historical cost and pricing structure. Such agreements are intended to allow BASF to uninterruptedly sustain the businesses that they've retained after the acquisition which were serviced significantly by BASF Paper & Water. These arrangements and related activities comprise the Company's Reverse Supply Agreements ("RSA") segment. Sales derived from Reverse Supply Agreements were 5% and 3% of total sales for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 Solenis also manufactures and supplies automated equipment, including performance-based feed and control systems, proprietary monitoring devices and remote system surveillance. The utility products, services and equipment offerings are designed to protect plant assets and optimize energy, water and operational costs at customers’ facilities.

 Solenis’ results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, can have a significant effect on operations. While Solenis maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Solenis could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to environmental remediation or other matters.

 Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies

 Use of Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties

 The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include impairment of long- lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computation of income tax provision, and calculation of reserves, including those for environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.

 COVID-19

 The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, could negatively impact the Company. Any future wide-ranging health scares could potentially adversely affect Solenis' business, financial condition and results of operations. The duration and intensity of this and future disruptions is uncertain, including potential broader impacts like factory closures, reduced workforce, scarcity of raw materials and the potential disruption of transportation of goods. The Company may be indirectly impacted from the reduction of orders from customers as a result of reduced consumer spending. Given the uncertainty regarding these circumstances, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

 Principles of Consolidation and Combination

 Our consolidated financial statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Solenis; including all Holding Companies.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Investments in companies in which Solenis, directly or indirectly, owns up to 50% of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result, Solenis’ share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations and Solenis' share of these companies’ shareholders’ equity is included in Investments in equity affiliates in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

 Foreign Currency Translation

 The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss).

 In circumstances where the economy in which one of the Company's subsidiaries operates is determined to be highly inflationary, the functional currency for the entity is changed to the U.S. dollar on a prospective basis. Refer to Note 21 for discussion surrounding the Company's operations in economies which have been determined to be highly inflationary.

 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

 Cash and cash equivalents represent cash in banks and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash which has a legal restriction regarding its use or withdrawal is classified as Restricted cash and is classified as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The below table reconciles Cash and cash equivalents to Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):

**As of September 30,**
**2020** **2019**
Cash and cash equivalents, as reported $ 253,990 $ 133,965
Restricted cash, included in other assets 1,511 1,559
Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 255,501 $ 135,524

###### Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. Accounts receivable are written down or off when a portion or all of such account receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense is recorded as a component of Selling, general and administration expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Additionally, Solenis maintains various global credit insurance policies which serve to partially indemnify the Company from the risk of loss related to uncollectible trade receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 receivable is recorded on a gross basis, independent of any considerations regarding potential indemnification assets resulting from successfully submitted claims under the Company's credit insurance policies. This indemnification asset is recorded as a component of Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The related benefit available to the Company for successfully submitted claims is recorded as a contra-expense as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Inventories, net

 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method. Inventories deemed to have costs greater than their respective market values are reduced to net realizable value as a loss in the period recognized. Inventories on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory based on anticipated demand and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.

 Property, Plant and Equipment

 Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives by asset class are summarized below:

Buildings and building improvements 25 to 35 years
Machinery and equipment 3 to 25 years
Software 5 to 10 years

###### The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines, and technological obsolescence.

 Recorded values of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows (assets held for use) or net realizable value (assets held for sale).

 Depreciation expense is presented as a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, depending upon the use of the underlying asset. There were no impairment charges for Property, plant and equipment during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, or 2018.

 Revenue Recognition

 Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped and title is transferred or services are provided to customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Collateral is generally not required. Sales are reported net of tax assessed by qualifying governmental authorities. For consignment inventory, title and risk of loss are transferred when the products have been consumed or used in the customer’s production process.

 Solenis accrues for sales returns and other allowances based on historical experience. The Company includes the amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees in Net sales with costs incurred for the delivery of goods as Cost of sales within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. 


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Expense Recognition

 Cost of sales includes material and production costs, as well as the costs of inbound and outbound freight, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, internal transfers, and all other distribution network costs. Selling, general and administrative expense includes sales and marketing costs, advertising, customer support, environmental remediation and administrative costs.

 The Company does not sell product with warranties. Accordingly, there are no liabilities for product warranties.

 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are reported as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expense was $1.7 million, $2.4 million, and $2.0 million for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

 Research and Development

 Research and development costs incurred during the normal course of business are expensed as incurred. In- process research development projects acquired in a business combination are recorded as intangible assets at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent costs related to acquire in-process research and development assets are expensed as incurred.

 Litigation

 The Company accrues for liabilities related to litigation matters when available information indicates that the liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

 Income Taxes

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 Where the Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company provides for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings.

 The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Additionally, the Company accrues for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The current portion of unrecognized tax benefits is included within Accounts Payable and the long-term portion is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Value Added Taxes ("VAT")

 Solenis is subject to VAT in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company’s collective global VAT positions do not have a right of offset and are netted by jurisdiction for financial statement presentation purposes.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company provides for gross asset, and gross liability positions within Prepaid expenses and other assets, and within Accrued expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2020, and 2019, the Company had gross VAT assets of $29.4 million, and $42.7 million, respectively, and gross VAT liability positions as of $26.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively. Within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company presents the net change in its global VAT positions within Other assets and liabilities. For the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, those net changes inclusive of currency translation adjustments were inflows of $34.7 million, outflows of $29.9 million, and outflows of $6.0 million, respectively.

 Accounting for Business Combinations

 The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date fair values. As applicable, any excess purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recorded as Goodwill.

 The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, involves an assessment of the factors including, but not limited to the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and an appropriate discount rate at the closing date of an acquisition. When necessary, the Company consults with external advisers to help determine fair value. For non-observable market values, the Company determines fair value using acceptable valuation principles.

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets

 In accordance with ASC 350, impairment tests are performed for goodwill and in-process research and development assets annually as of July 1 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level.

 The Company assigns goodwill to individual reporting units at the date of acquisition based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination. This assessment is based solely on the pre-acquisition expectation of revenue and free cash flow by reporting unit.

 When conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit (or asset, specific to any in-process research and development assets) is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.

 When determined necessary under the qualitative assessment, Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The latter is determined using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for goodwill are employed and include, but are not limited to, projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors, the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant.

 For the years ended September 30, 2020, and 2018, the Company recorded Goodwill impairment charges of $19.2 million and $27.7 million, respectively, resulting from an identified deficit between the fair value and the carrying value of the Company's various reporting at the respective measurement dates. Refer to Note 7 for additional discussion. There was no goodwill impairment for the year ended September 30, 2019.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 In prior periods, the Company held certain intangible in-process research and development assets classified as indefinite until the abandonment or completion of the associated research and development efforts. If abandoned, these assets were impaired. If the activities were completed, the assets were classified within intellectual property and the useful life of the assets was determined and amortized prospectively. Solenis' remaining IPR&D assets were impaired during the year ended September 30, 2018. The company has no IPR&D assets recorded as of September 30, 2020 or 2019.

 Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives and asset classes are as follows:

Customer relationships 5 to 20 years
Trademarks and trade names 3 to 20 years
Proprietary process know how 8 to 15 years
Intellectual property 3 to 15 years
Supply and reverse supply agreements 3 to 8 years
Other intangibles 3 years

###### The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 The carrying value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, to be held and used is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value and is based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies including present value techniques.

 During the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2018, the identified goodwill impairment noted above indicated that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The Company performed an undiscounted cash flow test and determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets was recoverable as of September 30 for both fiscal years. There was no identified impairment with respect to amortizable long-lived assets as of September 30, 2020, 2019, or 2018.

 Commitments, Contingencies and Environmental Costs

 Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.

 Accruals for environmental remediation are recognized when it is probable, when a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded at estimated present values based on experience, assessments and current technology, without regard to any third-party recoveries (which are recorded as assets) and are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and remediation efforts advance.

 Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits

 In connection with the acquisition of AWT, the Company assumed certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations for current and former employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries. All defined contribution pension plan obligations for current and former employees in the United States, as well as certain defined benefit and contribution pension plan obligations of former employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries, were retained by Ashland.

 In connection with the JV, certain employees of the former BASF Paper and Water Chemicals business transferred to subsidiaries of Solenis on January 31, 2019 and employment agreements were entered into between the respective parties on that date. As applicable, certain defined benefit plan obligations related to the transferred employees were acquired by the Company in connection with the JV are primarily within continental Europe. While the majority of the transferred employees are employed by Solenis' subsidiaries in the United States ("US") or the United Kingdom ("UK"), no defined benefit plan obligations were transferred to Solenis for any US, or UK based employees. Employees in these jurisdictions participate only in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans.

 Defined benefit plans specify an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. These benefits are then discounted to determine the present value of the obligations and are then adjusted for the impact of any unamortized prior service costs. The net obligation is then determined with reference to the fair value of the plan assets (if any). The discount rate used is the yield on bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the obligations.

 Share-based Compensation

 The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for all options and other arrangements within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718. Awards are classified as equity if such options are settled in shares and classified as liabilities if they are settled in cash. Share-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized using the "straight-line attribution method" over the employee’s requisite service period. Awards classified as liabilities are measured for fair value at each reporting date, with any changes to fair value recognized currently in earnings based on the extent of the requisite service period elapsed. The fair value of awards classified as liabilities are presented as a component of Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Share-based awards with vesting conditions other than service are recognized over the performance period based on the probability that those conditions will be achieved.

 For additional information on the Company`s share-based compensation plan, see Note 16.

 Fair Value Measurements

 U.S. GAAP defines a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value for assets and liabilities:

 Level 1—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

 Level 2—Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs); and

 Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities which are valued based on management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

 Net Asset Value ("NAV") - The Company invests in funds which are not quoted on an active market. These funds are valued based on the underlying fair value of the funds investments less the funds liabilities or net asset value.

 Derivatives

 The Company is exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency, changes in commodity prices and credit risk. The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuating interest rates on its long term debt. Refer to specific discussion of these arrangements within Note 12. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Statement of Cash Flows as part of Cash Flows from Operations.

 Sale of Accounts Receivable

 The Company accounts for sales of accounts receivables when control of receivables is surrendered. Whether control has been relinquished requires, among other considerations, an evaluation of the relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred. Assets obtained and liabilities incurred in connection with the transfers reported as sales are initially recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.

 Accounts receivable sold are deemed transferred to the counterparty in accordance with the prevailing purchase agreement applicable to the relevant jurisdiction. In situations where cash is immediately received from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, such cash is classified as cash received from operating activities. In situations where cash is not received immediately from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, the transfer is deemed to represent a non-cash investing activity whereby the receivable is sold for a subordinated interest in future cash collections. Ultimate collections of cash on the subordinated interest in future cash collections are treated as cash flows from investing activities.

 Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

 Announced Accounting Standards

 In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting guidance outlining a single comprehensive five step model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers (ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers) (the "new revenue standard"). The new revenue standard supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, in an effort to converge the revenue recognition principles within U.S. GAAP. This new guidance also requires entities to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of qualifying revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Entities have the option of using a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the new guidance. In June 2020,


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 the FASB issued ASU 2020-05, which results in a one-year deferral of the revised revenue recognition standard. As a result, the provisions of the new guidance were effective for the Company on October 1, 2020, immediately subsequent to the most recent fiscal year results presented within these consolidated financial statements. In adopting the new standard, management reviewed material contracts to identify key provisions that could cause differences in revenue recognition. Management is finalizing its review of the cumulative impact of the adoption of this standard and expects substantial changes to the substance and form of the Company's disclosures relative to the current presentation. 

 During February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases". The initial guidance and the subsequent amendments and deferrals issued, require that companies recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities relative to at least all leasing arrangements with terms in excess of 12 months. The guidance is expected to eliminate the majority of off-balance sheet financing arrangements and provide clarity around actual contractual obligations of the business. This guidance is effective for all private entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. In connection with its adoption of ASC 606 on October 1, 2020, management also determined to early adopt ASC 842 on the same date. In adopting the standard, management determined to adopt the package of practical expedients provided by the FASB and will utilize a "modified retrospective transition approach" such that balance sheet as of September 30, 2020 will not be recasted in connection with the adoption of the standard.

 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The guidance requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, but early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact this standard would have on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to the Company's processes around the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables.

 In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, "Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities." The update changes the process by which the Company identifies and designates a component for hedging activity; allowing companies to specify a component of overall cash flows for which the Company is trying to manage some form of risk. Adoption of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 for private companies. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. Retrospective application is required upon adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, "Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement". The update removed the disclosure requirements from Topic 820 for the valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements. Adoption of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of the update. Retrospective application is required upon adoption. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, "Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans." The update removed the disclosure requirements from Subtopic 715-20 for the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year and removed the disclosure requirements for the amount and timing of plan assets expected to be returned to the employer. Adoption of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this standard during the year ended September 30, 2020. There is no impact of early adoption other than the removal of a potential current year disclosure.

 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Intangibles - Goodwill and other Internal-Use-Software Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Contract." The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in a cloud computing arrangement service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred for an internal use software license. Capitalized implementation costs should be amortized over the term of the service agreement on a straight line basis and should be assessed for impairment in a manner similar to long-lived assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

 In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, "Derivatives and Hedging : Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes". Previously under Topic 815, the eligible benchmark interest rates in the United States were the interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government (UST), the LIBOR swap rate, the OIS Rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Municipal Swap Rate, which was introduced in ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). The amendments in ASU 2018-16 permit the use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. The guidance is effective at the same time as adoption of ASU 2017-12. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard.

 Current Year Business Combinations

 Chemsystems' Pulp and Paper Business

 On June 1, 2020, Solenis Technologies South Africa Pty Ltd., (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) acquired 100% of the assets of Chemsystems' Pulp and Paper business in South Africa. Chemsystems (a division of AECI Ltd.) is a manufacturer and distributor of specialized chemical solutions primarily serving the South African and sub-Saharan African markets. Prior to the transaction, Chemsystems was Solenis' Pulp and Paper specialty chemical distributor in Africa. The acquisition allows for Solenis to build a direct channel to customers in the African market without reliance on third parties or contractual restrictions. As the primary objective of this carve-out transaction was to acquire end-market customer relationships without increasing Solenis' physical footprint, Chemsystems agreed to continue to produce finished goods for sale to the acquired customers through a tolling agreement designed to maintain the current cash flow generation of the acquired business. As part of the transaction, a final working capital adjustment was agreed to between the parties with $0.8 million due to Solenis from the sellers as of September 30, 2020. All pre-existing balances due between the parties were settled in cash prior to close with no amounts settled in-kind. Total transaction costs incurred by the Company were $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2020, the measurement period is closed.

 Poliquimicos

 On July 14, 2020, Solenis Technologies Mexico, S. de R.L. DE C.V. (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Poliquimicos, S.A. de C.V. (“Poliquimicos”). Headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico, Poliquimicos is a leading producer and supplier of specialized chemical solutions for water-intensive industries, including the Pulp and Paper markets in Mexico. Prior to the transaction, Poliquimicos was Solenis' Pulp and Paper specialty chemical distributor in Mexico. The business will be integrated into Solenis' existing operations as part of the Company's direct-to-market strategy and improve the Company's production capabilities in the region. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded total Goodwill of $5.5 million, of which none are tax deductible, is primarily driven by expected revenue synergies associated with the integration of the acquired business into Solenis' existing operations.

 The final gross purchase price was $22.4 million, inclusive of $7.4 million of preexisting receivables due from the former owners which were effectively settled at close. In addition, the former owners may be entitled to incremental contingent consideration equal to a maximum of $1.8 million based on the post-combination Net sales and Gross profit of Solenis' combined Pulp and Paper business in Mexico during the two years subsequent to the close of the transaction. As of both the acquisition date, and September 30, 2020, the contingent consideration liability due to the former owners of Poliquimicos is valued at $0.6 million. As part of the transaction, a final working capital adjustment was agreed to between the parties with $0.3 million due to Solenis from the sellers as of September 30, 2020. These adjustments to the purchase price which have not been settled in cash at September 30, 2020 represent non-cash investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020. Total transaction costs incurred by the Company in connection with the transaction were $0.8 million. As of September 30, 2020, the measurement period is closed.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. These intangible assets collectively enable the Company to enhance its sales pipeline while manufacturing and developing new products to meet evolving business needs as well as competitively produce and sell existing products.

 Prior Year Business Combinations

 On January 31, 2019 Solenis, through its holding and operating Companies, acquired BASF's Paper & Water Chemicals Business ("BASF Paper & Water"). The acquisition advances the Company's strategic position in the global specialty chemical marketplace and provides significant advancements to manufacturing capability, sourcing channels, sales channels, economies of scale, and other operational efficiencies. A joint, pre-combination valuation exercise between the Company and BASF resulted in the determination of BASF Paper & Water's stand-alone enterprise value of approximately $900 million. After working capital and other adjustments, the final fair value of the assets acquired was determined to be $881.7 million.

 To acquire the net assets of BASF Paper & Water, Solenis issued 40,113,302 Ordinary shares in the Company, representing 49% of Ordinary shares outstanding after the issuance. The net book value of BASF's equity in the combined business was determined to be $677.8 million, representing 49% of the pre-combination equity value of the combined business. The remaining consideration was comprised of cash of $213.5 million prior to final working capital adjustments. The table below presents cash paid to BASF Paper & Water to complete the acquisition in addition to the equity consideration conveyed at close (in thousands):

###### In connection with the acquisition, the Company recognized $150.8 million of Goodwill, representing the excess consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired. Of the acquired Goodwill, $77.1 million is deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to anticipated revenue growth from the combined product portfolio and the assembled workforce of BASF Paper & Water and Solenis.

 The fair value of intangible assets, exclusive of Supply Agreements and Reverse Supply Agreements, were estimated using an income approach, either the excess earnings method or the relief from royalty method. Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after- tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. These intangible assets collectively enable the Company to manufacture and develop new products to meet evolving business needs as well as competitively produce our existing products.

 The Supply agreements require BASF to sell finished goods at a below-market rate to Solenis, generally at the approximate cash costs to produce the finished goods, over a specified period of time. Such agreements are intended to allow the Company to uninterruptedly sustain the acquired businesses without disruption in instances where BASF Paper and Water assets were retained by BASF as part of the JV. The fair value ascribed to these assets was determined using the with-or-without method, whereby cash flows to Solenis both with, and without the existence of the underlying agreements. The fair value ascribed to these assets is amortized through Cost of sales, straight-line, over their respective contractual lives. Refer to Note 7 for additional information.

 Reverse supply agreements require the Company to sell finished goods at a below-market rate to BASF, generally at the approximate cash costs to produce the finished goods, over a specified period of time. Such agreements are intended to allow BASF to uninterruptedly sustain the businesses that they've retained after the acquisition which were serviced significantly by BASF Paper & Water. The fair value ascribed to these liabilities was determined using the with-or-without method, whereby cash flows to Solenis both with, and without the existence of such obligations. The fair value ascribed to these liabilities are amortized through Net sales, straight-line, over their respective contractual lives. Refer to Note 7 for additional information.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company carries the estimated fair value of the Nanjing Purchase Option at $59.9 million, a component of Non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020, and 2019. There are certain perfunctory legal documents which must be processed to obtain the option. The Company controls this process and the related option and has therefore recognized this as an asset. Additionally, on the opening balance sheet the Company recorded a $59.9 million asset for the deposit paid at closing for the Nanjing Purchase Option. This deposit was structured in a form of a promissory note due from BASF. The proceeds from this note will be used to acquire the option to purchase the Nanjing plant in China. As the Company is legally bound to make this payment a corresponding liability of $59.9 million has also been recorded in the opening balance sheet. The asset and corresponding payable are presented as a component of Accounts receivable and Trade and other payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.

 As part of the acquisition, the Company paid VAT and transfer taxes of $34.1 million. Transfer taxes are reported as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses.

 Total transaction costs incurred during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 related to the JV were $0, $59.7 million and $27.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2019, the measurement period associated with acquisition was closed.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Bad debt expense for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $2.1 million, $5.0 million, and $1.4 million, respectively.

 During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company entered into various global credit insurance policies to partially mitigate the risk of loss of trade receivables. As such and on a recurring basis, the company performs an analysis of its bad debt positions to determine potential indemnification under these policies. As of, and for the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company has an indemnification asset recorded within Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as an offsetting benefit of $0.7 million reflected as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Note 5  Sale of Trade Receivables

 On March 26, 2018, the Company sold certain accounts receivable under the terms of a Receivables Purchase Agreement ("RPA" or "Accounts Receivable Financing") with ING Luxembourg ("ING"). The RPA carried a maximum capacity of $120.0 million and was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020.

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING will continue to service non-US markets with a maximum funding capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum funding capacity carried by MUFG to serve the US market is $75 million. As of September 30, 2020, the total capacity of the amended RPA agreements among the Company, ING and MUFG is $204.1 million, both of which are scheduled to expire in March of 2022.

 Through the Accounts Receivable Financing facilities with both counterparties, the Company sells eligible short- term trade receivables on the initial transfer date to either ING or MUFG in exchange for consideration inclusive of cash conveyed to Solenis (referred to as the Initial Purchase Price, or "IPP") and a beneficial interest in the receivables collected by either ING or MUFG (referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price, or "DPP"). The Company continues to service the receivables sold in connection with the arrangement. The RPA requires Solenis to pledge its cash collection accounts for the underlying receivables to ING for the non-US market and to MUFG for US markets, whereby neither the receivables sold to ING or MUFG nor the future cash collections on the sold receivables are assets of Solenis post-transfer.

 Through maturity, ING and MUFG purchases new receivables from Solenis on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the jurisdiction, in exchange for incremental DPP. These amounts are settled monthly against sold receivables which were previously collected.

 The DPP is carried at fair value, which is remeasured weekly to take into account activity during the period (the Company's interest in the newly-transferred receivables and collections on previously transferred receivables attributable to the DPP), as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. Refer to Note 12 for additional discussion surrounding the fair value of the DPP.

 Receivables are sold to ING and MUFG with the condition that Solenis indemnify ING and MUFG in the event of non-collection. Consequently, non-collections on sold receivables could expose the Company to losses. The maximum potential loss surrounding this transaction is equal to the face amount of receivables sold. The Company has evaluated the probability of loss, concluding the risk of material losses associated with this sale is remote. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold in the arrangement for year ended September 30, 2020 is $0.9 million, and were less than $0.1 million for the years ended 2019, and 2018.

(a) During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company identified certain purchase accounting adjustments which resulted
in the addition and reduction of Goodwill. Management evaluated these errors and determined that they were immaterial to
each of the reporting periods affected, and therefore, the revision of previously issued financial statements was not required.

###### The Company primarily defines its reporting units as its two primary operating segments: P&P and IWT, divided into four geographic regions: North America, EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), Asia Pacific (APAC), and Latin America (LA). The Company's ninth reporting unit is its collective Reverse Supply Agreement business. The Company does not disaggregate the results of its RSA business at a regional level for review by a chief operating decision maker ("CODM").

 As discussed in Note 2, the Company recorded impairment of Goodwill of $19.2 million, and $27.7 million, for the years ended September 30, 2020, and 2018, respectively. There was no impairment of Goodwill for 2019.

 In connection with Solenis' Goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1, 2018, the Company determined that the carrying value of the LA IWT and APAC P&P reporting units were each individually in excess of their fair values. As a result of this assessment, Solenis recorded a pre-tax impairment charge for Goodwill during the year ended September 30, 2018 of $27.7 million. Of this amount, $13.9 million was ascribable to LA IWT and $13.8 million was ascribable to APAC P&P. As of September 30, 2018, the remaining goodwill, net of accumulated impairment charges ascribed to LA IWT and APAC P&P were both $0.

 Subsequent to the full impairment of the Goodwill previously ascribed to APAC P&P, the acquisition of the BASF P&W business on January 31, 2019 again resulted in the determination to ascribe Goodwill to APAC P&P. In connection with our Goodwill impairment assessment as of July 1, 2020, the Company determined that the carrying value of the APAC P&P reporting unit was in excess of its fair value. As a result of this assessment, Solenis recorded a pre-tax impairment charge for Goodwill during the year ended September 30, 2020 of $19.2 million. As of September 30, 2020, the remaining Goodwill, net of accumulated impairment charges ascribed to APAC P&P was $0.

 Both the impairment charges recorded during the years ended September 30, 2020, and 2018 were driven by revisions to post-acquisition and post-investment (specific to long-lived assets) cash flow projections resulting from unrealized market-participant synergy objectives and changes in the broader macro-economic environment in which the Company operates.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by using both income and market-based methodologies. Solenis' income approach is based on an estimate of future cash flows, discounted to the present using a risk-adjusted market rate. Key assumptions involved in this determination include forecasted revenue, cost of sales, operating expenses (net of depreciation and amortization expenses), and adjusting these items for annual working capital needs and investments in property, plant, and equipment. Such forecasts are rooted in the macroeconomic factors, such as expectation of growth of gross domestic product in a particular region during the forecast period, industry factors, such as the expectation of increased demand from a particular region over the forecast period, and company-specific factors, such as the expectation for additional investment in a particular region based on discussions with management. These future cash flows are discounted to present value using a weighted average cost of capital, determined by a capital asset pricing model. Inputs into the capital asset pricing model include market-observed assumptions such as the risk-free rate of return, premia for credit risk, equity risk, small stock, and country risk, as applicable, and systematic and unsystematic returns on capital observed in market-comparable companies; all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace.

 Such assumptions are based off of expectations of future company, industry, and macroeconomic growth in the future which may not ultimately be realized and, in such a circumstance, could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the future cash flows of the reporting unit.

 The discount rate used in these analyses represents the weighted average cost of capital for the relevant reporting units considering the risks and uncertainties inherent in the cash flows and in the internally developed forecasts. The discount rate is determined based on market factors which exist at the time of the analysis, including a risk- free rate tied to US treasuries, market-observed equity risk premia, and country risk premia where applicable, and other unsystematic adjustments added to account for Company-specific and region-specific factors. The weighted average capitalization is determined based on the debt and equity capitalization of comparable companies. Increases to the risk-free rate or other risk premia, through actions by central banks or reactions to the marketplace by investors, whether globally or concentrated in a particular geographic region, could increase the discount rate in the analysis and negatively impact the evaluation for a particular reporting unit. Similarly, legislation which would decrease tax rates in a particular reporting unit could increase the weighted average cost of capital, negatively impacting the valuation.

 Solenis' market-based approach employs a valuation technique based on multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue for comparable companies that is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value. Solenis' use of this market based methodology is restricted to circumstances in which comparable companies have observable operations and economic characteristics which are similar to those of Solenis. All comparable companies operate in the specialty chemicals industry. Changes in investor confidence regarding the industry or the market as a whole could cause equity values for these companies to fall relative to their overall performance. Such changes could negatively affect the valuation of Solenis and its reporting units.

 When necessary, the use of unobservable inputs resulted in the fair value estimate being classified as a Level 3 asset measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to its original recognition. The determination of whether or not goodwill is impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approaches used to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Solenis believes that assumptions and rates used in the impairment assessment are reasonable. However, these assumptions are judgmental and variations in any assumptions could result in materially different calculations of fair value. The Company will continue to evaluate Goodwill on an annual basis as of July 1, and whenever events or changes in circumstances occur, such as significant adverse changes in operating results, market conditions or changes in management’s business strategy, indicate that there may be a probable indicator of impairment. It is possible that the assumptions used by management related to the evaluation may change or that actual results may vary significantly from management’s estimates.

###### On July 31, 2014, International and Solenis Holdings 3 LLC, then a subsidiary of International, entered into a First Lien Credit Agreement ("First Lien Credit Agreement due 2021"), comprised of a $630.0 million loan ("First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021"), a €230.0 million loan ("First Lien Euro Loan due 2021"), and a $200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolving Credit Facility due 2019"). On that same day, International and Solenis Holdings 3 LLC entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement comprising a $470.0 million loan (the "Second Lien Credit Agreement due 2022"). Subsequent to these transactions, the Company entered into two additional


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement due 2021: one for €85 million during the second quarter of 2015 and one for €100 million during the third quarter of 2016. These agreements are collectively referred to as the "Old Debt".

 On June 26, 2018, Solenis Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the First Lien Credit Agreement (the "First Lien Credit Agreement") which includes a $200 million Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), and a Second Lien Credit Agreement through which the company borrowed aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion, with original maturity dates of December 2023, and June 2024 for the First Lien Credit Agreement, and Second lien Credit Agreement, respectively. The First and Second Lien Credit Agreements were consummated to provide net proceeds which facilitated the Joint Venture between Solenis and BASF and allow for an extension of the terms of each of the credit agreements and the Revolving Credit Facility. These agreements are collectively referred to as the "New Debt". The proceeds from each of these borrowings were used in combination with one another to repay the remaining principal balance on the Company's Old Debt. 

 As part of the closing of the Joint Venture on January 31, 2019, the Company borrowed an incremental $170 million and €330 million under the First Lien Credit Agreement, and increased the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility from $200 million to $375 million, at which time the Company borrowed an incremental $124 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. The closing of the Joint Venture also extended the maturity date of all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement (except for the Revolving Credit Facility) by 18 months, from December 26, 2023 to June 26, 2025, and extended the maturity date of the Second Lien Credit Agreement by 24 months, from June 25, 2024 to June 26, 2026.

 For both the June 26, 2018 refinancing and the incremental borrowing on January 31, 2019 the Company applied the guidance prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discounts related to the original borrowing. As a result of these transactions, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million and $10.7 million during the years ended September 30, 2019, and September 30, 2018, respectively. These amounts primarily related to deferred financing costs and original issue discount ascribable to lenders who did not participate in the June 26, 2018 refinancing or the January 31, 2019 incremental borrowing. These amounts are included as part of Non-operating expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with portions of the debt determined to be modified were allocated to the First Lien Credit Agreement due 2025 and Second Lien Credit Agreement due 2026 to be amortized over the life of the associated agreements.

 On February 5, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to supplement its First Lien Credit Agreement which resulted in incremental gross proceeds of $150 million and €100 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on its Revolving Credit facility by the same amount as the incremental proceeds. An incremental debt discount of $1.3 million and incremental deferred financing costs of $1.6 million were capitalized consistent with the guidance prescribed above within ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments. All other terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement remained consistent, including but not limited to, the outstanding indebtedness thereunder being due June 26, 2025.

 First Lien Credit Agreement

 Obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned UK subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"), and, solely by recourse to the equity of the Company, by Solenis UK Industries Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Solenis Holdings Sub II B.V. (collectively, the "Holdings Guarantors"). The First Lien Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 exceptions, as well as the equity of the Company held by the Holdings Guarantors. Principal is paid on the last day of each quarter in an amount equal to $2.8 million and €2.0 million for the First Lien Dollar Loan and First Lien Euro Loan, respectively.

 Interest rates on all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement are variable. The First Lien Dollar Loan carries an interest rate of 4%, plus the greater of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or 0%. The First Lien Euro Loan carries an interest rate of 4.25% plus the greater of the Euro London Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") or 0.5%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months.

 Term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement mature on June 26, 2025. The Company is permitted to prepay all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time. Through September 30, 2020, the Company has not made any voluntary prepayments on the First Lien Loans in normal course.

 The First Lien Loans are subject to mandatory prepayments equal to 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, beginning in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, a mandatory prepayment of $12.4 million is required and will be remitted during the first fiscal quarter of 2021. There was no mandatory prepayment required as of September 30, 2019. As such, the Company's current portion of long-term debt as of September 30, 2020 is inclusive of this mandatory prepayment.

 The obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are effectively senior to all of the Company's Second Lien Debt and unsecured debt, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations.

 In addition, if, at the end of any quarter, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 35% of the aggregate amount available, or $326.8 million, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, of 7.30 to 1. The First Lien Credit Agreement also includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the nature of our business. As of September 30, 2020, the Company is in compliance with all positive and negative and affirmative covenants under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

 The Revolving Credit Facility allows maximum borrowings of $375.0 million and matures on June 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is, at the election of the Borrower, ABR plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. As of September 30, 2020, the company had $34.2 million of revolver borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility.

 The Company had $326.8 million of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2023 as of September 30, 2020. This amount consisted of $340.8 less undrawn standby letters of $14.0 million.

 Second Lien Credit Agreement

 The Second Lien Credit Agreement carries the same guaranty and security package as the First Lien Credit Agreement. No principal payments are due in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement until maturity. The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on June 26, 2026.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company is permitted to prepay the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. Prepayments made prior to June 26, 2020 would have incurred a 2% penalty of the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2020 but prior to June 26, 2021 will incur a 1% penalty on the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2021 are free of penalty. The prepayment penalty is assessed regardless of whether or not the prepayment was mandatory or voluntary.

 The interest rate on the Second Lien Credit Agreement is 8.5% plus the greater of LIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months. The Second Lien Credit Agreement is junior in priority to the First Lien Credit Agreement and senior to all other unsecured debt.

 The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the nature of our business.

 As of September 30, 2020, there are no co-borrowers on either the First Lien Credit Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Agreement and the company is in compliance with all related covenants therein.

 Equipment Financing

 On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a $25.0 million equipment financing (leaseback) arrangement with a third party maturing on December 31, 2023. In accordance with ASC 840-40-25-5, Sale-Leaseback Transactions, the transaction was accounted for as a financing arrangement and is reflected as debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020. Solenis did not account for this transaction as a "sale" as the Company retains the risks and benefits of ownership during the term of the arrangement and has a bargain- purchase option at maturity to re-acquire legal title to the collateralized assets. In connection with the transaction, the Company paid $0.5 million in deferred financing fees which were capitalized at the transaction date and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement.

 Deferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount

 The composition of Deferred Financing Costs and the Original Issue Discount which remain capitalized as of September 30, 2020 are derived from a variety of sources. Specifically, those sources are as follows:

 • Financing costs and original issue discount incurred directly with the First and Second Lien Credit agreements, as part of the borrowings completed on June 26, 2018, January 31, 2019, and February 5, 2020;

 • Financing costs and original issue discount carried over from the Old Debt related to portions which were determined to be modified. These amounts generally relate to portions of the debt held by lenders who participated in both syndicates comprising the Old Debt and the June 26, 2018 borrowing;

 • Financing fees paid in connection with December 31, 2019 Equipment Financing.

 Note 11  Employee Benefit Plans

 Pension Plans

 Qualifying employees participate in specific defined-benefit pension plans, which typically provide pension payments based on an employee’s length of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or have a cash balance design.

 In connection with the Acquisition, we assumed certain defined benefit plan obligations for both current and former employees of certain subsidiaries. All defined benefit pension plan obligations for current and former employees in the U.S., as well as certain defined benefit pension plan obligations of former employees of non- U.S. subsidiaries, were retained by Ashland.

 The defined benefit obligations for remaining current employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries assumed by Solenis were carved out of defined benefit pension plans retained by Ashland. The Company has created new defined benefit pension plans for all affected participants. The Acquisition Agreement required Ashland to transfer assets from Ashland’s funded defined benefit pension plans to our defined benefit pension plans. The determination of asset transfers was completed as of September 30, 2014 for all plans.

 On January 1, 2015, the Company created a new defined benefit plan for certain participants in the Netherlands. Amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended September 30, 2020, and 2019 include balances and activity specific to this plan.

 In connection with the JVFA, Solenis assumed defined benefit plan obligations for transferred employees in six countries. Where funded, BASF transferred plan assets to Solenis. In the aggregate, the Company assumed a net obligation of $2.4 million related to the transferred employees which was recorded against Goodwill on the

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Transferred employees with existing BASF-sponsored defined benefit plans were primarily transferred to existing Solenis plans as of January 31, 2019. Amounts recorded within the Company's consolidated financial statements as of, and for the years ended September 30, 2020, and 2019 include balances and activity specific to the transferred employees.

 Post-Retirement Plans

 Solenis also assumed in connection with the Acquisition certain long-term employee health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees. Certain programs are noncontributory and other programs share the cost with retirees through payment of premiums, deductibles and coinsurance provisions. Where not restricted by law or by separate agreements with the workforce, the Company also committed to maintain comparable employee benefits to what was provided for preexisting employees for a period of eighteen months from the date of the Acquisition.

###### Plan assets

 The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on the pension plan assets was 3.6% and 4.1% as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The basis for determining the expected long-term rate of return is a combination of future return assumptions for various asset classes in our investment portfolio, historical analysis of previous returns, market indices and a projection of inflation.

###### Investment Strategy

 In developing an investment strategy for its defined benefit plans, the Company considered the following factors: the nature of the plans’ liabilities, the allocation of liabilities between active, deferred and retired members, the funded status of the plans, the applicable investment horizon, the respective size of the plans and historical and expected capital market returns. Pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers, which are monitored against investment return benchmarks and our established investment strategy. Investment managers are selected based on an analysis of, among other things, their investment process, historical investment results, and frequency of management turnover, cost structure and assets under management. Assets are periodically reallocated between investment managers to maintain an appropriate asset mix and diversification of investments and to optimize returns.

 Plan assets include both fixed income and traditional equity securities that are allocated across both domestic and international markets. Additionally, certain pension plan assets are dictated by applicable regulations within the respective country.

 The weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows:

**Actual**
**As of September 30,**
**Target** **2020** **2019**
**Plan assets allocation**

All contributions and Company matches are invested at the direction of the employee.

 Contributions to these plans were $14.8 million, $13.0 million, and $9.7 million, respectively during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. Additionally, the Company sponsors various other benefit plans, some of which are required by law or statute in certain international jurisdictions.

###### The fair values of Solenis' primary term debt instruments are based on estimates using quoted market prices and pricing models that take into account the present value of future cash flows as of the respective balance sheet date. The Company's believes that these instruments qualify as Level 2 measurements. The carrying amounts of the remainder of Solenis' debt and capital lease obligations approximate fair value due to their primarily short-term nature.

 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

 In order to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, Solenis may create offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 In November 2014, the Solenis entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge interest rate exposure related to a portion of the Company's long-term debt. As a result of these arrangements, the Company effectively converted $440.0 million of its US Dollar denominated debt from a floating interest rate to a fixed LIBOR rate of 2.59% for a 2.5 year period from November 30, 2016 through May 30, 2019.

 On June 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into the First and Second Lien Credit Agreements, the proceeds from which were used to pay off outstanding principal amounts on the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021. More information regarding this refinancing event can be found in Note 10. Despite the payoff of the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021, (i) the Company still bore interest rate risk exposure through its wholly- owned subsidiary; (ii) the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2023 still carried an outstanding principal balance in excess of the $440.0 million notional amount in the interest rate and; (iii) interest payments under the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2023 carried a variable interest rate tied to LIBOR. As such, the Company determined that the hedge continued to be effective after the refinancing and, therefore, Solenis continued to apply cash flow hedge accounting through the maturity date of the swaps. As of May 30, 2019, these swaps were effectively settled with no amounts due to, or due from the counterparty.

 During the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million. As a result of these


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 arrangements, the Company collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.26%, 3.12%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36- month period from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022.

 These contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. On both a retrospective and prospective basis, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss or income until the settlement of the related business transaction at which time the accumulated gain or loss from the contracts will be reclassified into earnings. There was no ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument recognized during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 For the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 the Company reclassified expense of $12.6 million, $1.7 million, and $3.3 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the paid and accrued interest recognized on the Company's interest rate swap liability.

 As of September 30, 2020, the Company expects losses of $18.6 million presented within Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) to be reclassified to net income or loss during the next 12 months.

 Deferred Purchase Price on Accounts Receivable Financing

 On March 26, 2018, the Company entered into an arrangement to sell accounts receivable under the terms of a RPA with ING. The RPA carried a maximum capacity of $120.0 million and was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional details.

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING will continue to service non-US markets for the maximum capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum RPA capacity carried by MUFG is $75 million to serve the US market. The total capacity of the RPA agreements among the Company, ING and MUFG is $204.1 million. The RPA agreement with MUFG and the amended RPA agreement with ING are scheduled to expire in March of 2022. Refer to Note 5, Sale of Trade Receivables for additional details.

 Initial consideration received from ING and MUFG through the Accounts Receivable Financing included a subordinated interest in transferred receivables collected, referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price. The DPP is carried at fair value and is remeasured weekly to reflect activity during the period (i.e. the Company's interest in subsequently-transferred receivables and collections on receivables previously sold to ING or MUFG) as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. The fair value of the DPP is predicated upon the underlying receivables which have been transferred to ING or MUFG. As the underlying receivables represent the Company's customers with the highest credit quality and are generally collectible within 90 days, the Company expects the fair value of the DPP to be equal to its face value.

 Receivables under the Accounts Receivable Financing are transferred to ING or MUFG daily, weekly, or monthly in accordance with the prevailing agreement for each jurisdiction. The consideration for the transfer of these receivables is incremental DPP to be settled at each settlement date, as defined in the RPAs.

 As the receivables transferred to ING and MUFG do not have an active market for equivalent or similar assets, the Company's fair value assessment is predicated upon its own history of collection surrounding the specific customers' receivables which have been transferred. Accordingly, such inputs qualify as Level 3 inputs. Due to the high credit quality and the relatively short-term nature of the underlying receivables, fluctuations in credit quality are expected to have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the DPP.

 As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the DPP is carried at $164.5 million and $191.8 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Sold receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 In connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture with BASF on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a number of "take or pay" contracts (the "Supply Agreements") through which BASF will make certain materials required to service acquired BASF legacy customers available to Solenis based upon a combination of legacy BASF volumes for these materials and available manufacturing capacity. The term of these agreements is either three (the "Medium Term"), or eight years (the "Long Term"). Upon maturity, each of the Medium Term agreements will automatically extend for 12 months on a revolving basis unless either party provides 24 months notice of their intention to exit the agreement. There is no penalty for either party to exit provided the 24 month notice period is met. Upon maturity, each of the Long Term agreements will expire immediately unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Solenis and BASF.

 Given the substantial capital and working capital requirements necessary to maintain available capacity and meet Solenis' purchasing requirements, the Company is required to remit minimum monthly payments (the "Fixed Manufacturing Costs") designed to cover BASF's plant overhead costs specific to the impacted production lines. The monthly payments are fixed and determinable, based on allocations of BASF's heritage costing structure relative to expected production and volumes and vary only based upon annual changes in inflation rates observable in the public domain.

 Fixed Manufacturing Costs are recognized as a component of Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operation. Total Fixed Manufacturing Costs incurred during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, were $72.0 million and $49.0 million, respectively.

 As this arrangement meets the definition of an "embedded lease" under ASC 840, the estimated future commitments associated with the right to use the underlying equipment utilized by BASF to supply Solenis with

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 these materials is reflected within the "Operating Leases" section of the table above. The future minimum payments related to the embedded lease were calculated based on an allocation of the stand-alone fair value of lease deliverables and non-lease deliverables provided under the Supply Agreements. All other Fixed Manufacturing Costs due to BASF during the contractual term of these agreements is reflected in the table below as a commitment. Though deemed embedded leases under ASC 840, the Company is evaluating whether these agreements meet the definition of an embedded lease under ASC 842 which is to be adopted by the Company on October 1, 2020. As such, the disclosure presented in the following table may vary in future periods even in the absence of changes to existing legal agreements.

 Future minimum Fixed Manufacturing Costs as of September 30, 2020 are as follows (in thousands):

**Future Minimum Commitment Payments**
2021 $ 61,942
2022 50,074

###### Environmental Remediation

 Due to the nature of Solenis' business, the Company is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety. The total reserves for environmental remediation reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries.

 Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multi- party sites. 

 Under the terms of the initial carve-out from Ashland, the Company is indemnified for certain pre-existing environmental remediation costs. Certain of these indemnified costs are required to exceed a deductible of 2% of the purchase price paid in the acquisition in order for indemnification to be available.

 In connection with the JV, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis. During the diligence process related to the acquisition, Solenis performed diligence related to potential environmental or other continent liabilities. As no probable or estimable exposure existed at the acquisition date, Solenis is not indemnified with respect to any environmental or other contingent matters. As of both September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company does not have material contingent obligations which are both probable and estimable related to these production facilities, transferred employees, or other real property acquired from BASF.

 As of both September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, related to two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. These reserves are included as part of other non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Given the limited time frame over


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 which remediation activities are expected to be performed, the Company has not discounted any projected future cash outflows in determining these reserves as of September 30, 2020.

 Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million relates to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million relates to management's best estimate for potential exposure related to ground contamination at the Company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a potential Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management's best estimate of total expenses to be incurred, made with the assistance of a third-party specialist.

 Indemnification assets associated with environmental remediation claims are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of Other assets in the amounts of $1.0 million and $1.4 million as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 Other Legal Proceedings

 In addition to the matters described above, there are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings that are pending or threatened. Such actions seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts.

 The Company has accrued for legal reserves of $3.5 million and $1.9 million as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While Solenis cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, the Company believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions.

 In addition to its uncertain tax positions which are referenced within Note 20, the Company has accrued for various contingent liabilities related to indirect taxes. As of September 30, 2020, the Company has accrued for potential exposure related to these positions of $5.7 million, of which Solenis is indemnified for $3.6 million by the former owners of Solenis' business combinations since inception. As of September 30, 2019, the Company had recorded liabilities specific to these positions of $10.4 million, and was indemnified for $8.5 million of these obligations. As of both September 30, 2020, and 2019, these obligations and the related indemnification assets are recorded as a component of Other non-current liabilities, and Other assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Insurance

 Solenis maintains deductibles for general liability, business interruption and property damage to owned, leased and rented property. These deductibles could be material to our earnings, but they are not material to our overall financial position. The Company carries substantial excess general liability, property and business interruption insurance above our deductibles. In addition, Solenis meets all statutory requirements for automobile liability and workers’ compensation.

 Note 14  Shareholders' (Deficit) Equity

 As of September 30, 2020, the Company had 82,059,238 shares of $1 par value Ordinary shares issued and outstanding. The holders of the Company's Ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share and are entitled to dividends or returns of capital as declared by the Company's board of directors. The board of directors have no limit to the number of Ordinary shares they are authorized to issue. Management has legally assigned the voting rights associated with their shares to CD&R. Despite this, Management has retained all other rights associated with such shares.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company's Ordinary shares are the only classification of common stock outstanding as of September 30, 2020. The Company's board of directors reserve the right to create and designate a new class of common shares at their discretion with necessary shareholder approval. The designations, powers, preferences, voting rights, privileges, options, conversion rights, and other special rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof shall be designated by the board of directors.

 The Company has no Preferred shares.

 Class A, Class B, and Ordinary Shares

 On July 31, 2014, CD&R contributed $405.0 million of cash to the Holding Companies in exchange for 40,500,000 of Class A shares of Common stock in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. No additional Class A shares were purchased or sold prior to the closing of the Joint Venture.

 Between July 31, 2014 and the closing of the Joint Venture, members of Management purchased Class B shares of Common stock in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. As of the date of the Joint Venture, 1,261,829 Class B shares were outstanding.

 On December 27, 2017, Solenis I Coopertief U.A. issued a return of capital in kind to CD&R totaling $400.0 million. The return of capital was issued in the form of a note payable. On April 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Solenis Holdings I Coopertief U.A. passed a resolution to recapitalize $405.1 million representing the initial note payable and related interest accrued. On May 1, 2018 Solenis Holdings Top I B.V. issued a return on capital of $400.0 million in the form of a note payable maturing on April 30, 2020 to CD&R. 

 On January 31, 2019, CD&R exchanged their 40,500,000 shares of Class A Common stock in exchange for 35,624,716 Ordinary shares of Solenis UK International Limited. Additionally, CD&R received $303.0 million in cash which represented a partial repayment of the $400.0 million on the note payable due from Solenis Holding Top I B.V. The $303.0 million in cash paid constitutes $293.4 million in partial repayment of principal and $9.6 million of accrued interest. CD&R exchanged the remaining balance of $106.6 million principal outstanding on the note payable for 6,137,113 Ordinary shares in Solenis. This transaction was financed using proceeds from the Incremental Borrowings.

 On January 31, 2019, Management exchanged their 1,261,829 shares of Class B Common stock in exchange for 1,261,829 Ordinary shares of Solenis and $9.4 million of cash. In order to avoid a dilutive adjustment in accordance with the provision of the Plan, management shareholders received a $4.4 million incremental return of capital during the year ended September 30, 2019.

 On January 31, 2019, as part of consideration transferred to acquire BASF Paper & Water, Solenis issued 40,113,302 Ordinary shares and $203.8 million in cash to BASF. The fair value of the Ordinary shares conveyed, based upon the total equity value of the combined business, exclusive of expected synergies, was $677.8 million.

 Treasury Stock

 The Company repurchases shares from directors and officers who leave the Company within three months of their departure and from persons who exercise options one year after the exercise date. Treasury shares are not retired and are not available for re-issuance. Treasury stock is accounted under the cost method.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 As of September 30, 2020, the Company has repurchased 802,281 of Class B Shares and 315,868 Ordinary shares from former management shareholders. As of September 30, 2019, the Company has repurchased 802,281 of Class B Shares and 58,821 Ordinary shares from former management shareholders.

 Note 15 Restructuring and Severance Activities

 The Company's strategic growth objectives either through acquisition or organic opportunities are partially driven by cost synergies which reduce the long-term costs required to serve Solenis' customers. These long-term cost synergies are often actioned through specific reductions in force. As a result of these programs, Solenis incurred severance charges of $21.3 million, $31.2 million, and $5.9 million during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 respectively. Of the total severance charges incurred, $0.1 million, $0.7 million, and $0.1 million are included within Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 Severance reserves are included in Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following table details the amount and activity of severance reserves related to these programs (in thousands):

Balance as of September 30, 2017 $ 8,531
Severance charges 5,921
Utilization (cash paid or otherwise settled) (13,024)
Currency translation 24
Balance as of September 30, 2018 $ 1,452
Severance charges 31,199

Currency translation (139)
Balance as of September 30, 2020 $ 16,237

###### Severance activities during the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019 were primarily related to cost rationalization projects in response to COVID-19 and planned reductions in force in connection with the synergy objectives for the JV.

 Note 16  Share-based Compensation

 Stock Incentive Plan

 Effective July 8, 2014, the Company's board of directors adopted the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to which the Company's board of directors shall select officers and key employees and directors to participate in the plan and grant stock options and offer opportunities to purchase shares. The plan allows for the issuance of up to 6,500,000 Class B shares under the plan (for all share-based compensation and share purchases). All stock options granted have a term not greater than ten years. Stock options vest and become exercisable, in whole or in part, with vesting conditions set by the Company's board of directors.

 The options are provided in two separate grants which have differing vesting conditions. Service Options, which reflect 75% of all options granted, vest in four equal annual installments, coinciding with the first anniversary date


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 of the grant date and each successive anniversary thereafter. Performance Options, which represent the remaining 25% of the options granted, vest upon the conclusion of each of the four fiscal years subsequent to the grant date based on the achievement of specified "EBITDA" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; subject to management adjustments) targets during the fiscal year in which they vest. The extent of vesting is based on the Company's financial performance relative to EBITDA targets stipulated by the Board of Directors. The vesting of both Service and Performance Options are contingent upon continuous employment through the respective measurement dates.

 On January 31, 2019, the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan was superseded by the Solenis UK International Limited Stock Incentive Plan ("the Plan") as part of the closing of the Joint Venture. All outstanding Service Options to purchase shares in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. were converted to options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. Service Options which were vested were exchanged for fully vested options. Unvested Service Options were exchanged for Service Options with identical vesting periods to the canceled awards. As of September 30, 2020, 1,650,105 shares or options were available for grant.

 In connection with the JV, all holders of Class A and B shares were provided with a return of capital conveyed in cash to facilitate the required equity holdings amongst the JV participants (CD&R, BASF and management shareholders). In addition, and to uphold the anti-dilutive provision of the Plan, the intrinsic value of all Class B options was kept constant through a reduction of option exercise prices equal to the per-share value of the return of capital conveyed to all Class A and B equity holders. In circumstances where this was not possible due to limitations under Section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company compensated option holders in cash totaling $4.4 million. This cash is considered to be a return of capital and presented as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The Company applied the guidance prescribed by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding the cancellation of the old awards and simultaneous grant of new awards. Based on the prescribed guidance, the Company determined that the two transactions, in combination, represent a modification of the original award. Subsequent accounting for modifications is predicated upon the fair value of the original award immediately before and the new award immediately after the modification. Management's analysis concluded that the fair value of the new award did not exceed the fair value of the old award on the modification date. Therefore, the Company will continue to ratably recognize the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the original awards based on the fair value of the awards as of the original grant date over the remaining vesting period.

 Compensation expense for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $2.2 million, $2.6 million, and $4.0 million, respectively.

 In addition, as part of the closing of the Joint Venture, all unvested Performance Options to purchase shares in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. were canceled and new Performance Options were granted to replace the canceled awards. The exchange of Service and Performance Options for new awards are collectively referred to as the "Modification".

###### Stock Options

 Stock incentive plan allows stock option grants for shares at a price based on the most recent valuation of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of the grant and may be subject to anti-dilution. Stock options under the plan become exercisable over four equal annual installments. Every option equals one share. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

 Share-based compensation expense is recognized as a component of Selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company records compensation expense related to all stock awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards. Compensation expense for Service Options is recognized over the requisite service period, while expense for Performance Options is recognized over the performance period based on successful achievement of performance-based conditions or targets.

###### The per-option weighted average grant-date fair value of Service options granted during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $5.53, $9.32, and $9.66, respectively.

 The per-option weighted average grant-date fair value of Performance options granted during the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $2.81 and $5.18. The performance options granted during the period ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 fully vested as a result of achieving the fiscal year EBITDA targets. However, as of September 30, 2020 these options have no intrinsic value due to a decline in the equity share price from the date of grant. There were no performance options granted for the year ended September 30, 2018.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The fair value of each option grant on its grant date was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility was based on peer group and historical data. The risk free interest rate was based on the yield of zero coupon U.S. Treasury bonds for terms that approximated the terms of the options granted. Expected life is estimated based on the Company's historical data. The Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero.

 The fair value assumptions used to arrive at this fair value using Black-Scholes inputs are as follows:

**2020** **2019** **2018**


**Service-**
**Based**
**options**


**Performance**

Weighted average expected life (in
6.3 4.8 6.3 4.7 6.3
years)

###### To estimate the expected life for stock option term, the Company used the simplified method as the awards were granted at fair value and Solenis, a privately-held company, has limited exercise history. The risk-free rates for periods within the expected life of the awards are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 The board of directors does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. Volatility is based upon peer groups as the Company is privately-held. As Solenis is not publicly traded, the market value of the stock is estimated based upon third-party valuations.

 For the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, Solenis received cash of $1.3 million, $0.6 million, $4.1 million, respectively for the exercise of stock options. The related tax benefit realized from stock options exercised for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was less than $0.1 million, and $0.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2018.

 Stock Appreciation Rights

 Certain employees were granted Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), representing stock awards to be settled in cash. The Company recognized these as liability-classified awards in accordance with ASC 718. Consistent with our equity based awards, the Company has SARs which vest in accordance with service ("Service SARs") and performance ("Performance SARs") conditions. SAR based compensation is included as a part of Selling, general, and administrative expenses.

 Like the Service Options, Service SARs originally issued as part of the Plan which participated in the appreciation of the price of Class B Shares were converted to rights to participate in share price appreciation of the Company's Ordinary shares. Vested SARs were converted to vested SARs and unvested SARs were converted to SARs with identical vesting and other contractual conditions. Strike prices were revised in accordance with the Plan's anti- dilution provision.

 Like the Performance Options, all Performance SARs were canceled as of the Modification date. No Performance SARs have been granted during the year ended September 30, 2020.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Share appreciation rights issued under the plan are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using Black- Scholes inputs applicable at the reporting date. Differences in fair value between reporting dates are recognized in earnings as part of Selling, general, and administrative expense to the extent that awards have vested or are expected to vest. 

 As of September 30, 2020, and 2019, the fair value of SARs outstanding were both $0.2 million. The fair value of SARs outstanding are included as part of Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2020, and 2019. All outstanding SARs were exercisable as of September 30, 2020, and 2019.

 Restricted Stock Units

 In February 2020, certain members of the management team were granted a total of 1.1 million Restricted Stock Units (RSU) with a term of seven years and vesting contingent upon a combination of a liquidation event (Performance Obligation), the implied per-share equity value of the liquidation event at a pre-defined minimum threshold amount (Market Condition), and that a grantee continues to render service until the date of the liquidation event (Service Condition).

 Vesting of the RSU's range between 70% - 100%, where 70% is at minimum pre-defined exit price per share and 100% is at maximum pre-defined exit price per share.

 In the event of vesting, grantees shall receive cash proceeds within 75 days of the liquidity event. Although, at the discretion of the Board, the cash proceeds may be required for an equity contribution back to the Company. Grantees that leave the Company either voluntarily or involuntarily prior to vesting conditions are met will forfeit their respective grants.

 In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, vesting of these awards is contingent upon performance obligations and market conditions which are outside of management's control and such conditions cannot be assumed or estimated based on lack of history and potential outcomes. As the likelihood of achievement of the Performance condition cannot be assessed as "probable", no compensation expense will be recognized until the performance condition is achieved. As such, no expense was recognized with respect to these awards during the year ended September 30, 2020.

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Based on the probability-weighted fair value of the estimated payments due as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 with respect to the contingent consideration obligations due to the former owners of Topchim, the Company recognized gains of $0, and $5.7 million during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

 During the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized $3.2 million, $3.1 million, and $1.4 million, respectively, in remeasurement losses as a result of the hyperinflationary economic environment in Argentina in which the Company has a consolidated subsidiary. Of these amounts, $1.4 million, $3.1 million, and $1.4 million are reflected as components of Non-operating expense (income) primarily within Unrealized foreign exchange losses (gains), net. Refer to Note 21 for additional details.

 Note 19  Related Parties

 As of September 30, 2020, voting control in Solenis is held collectively by CD&R which owns 49.5% of all outstanding shares, and management which owns 1.5% of the outstanding shares. Management has legally assigned their voting rights to CD&R, allowing CD&R to 51% control of outstanding voting rights. As a result of the JV, BASF owns 49% of the outstanding shares of Solenis.

 Relationship with CD&R

 On July 31, 2014, International, through its subsidiary, Solenis Switzerland Holdings GmbH, entered into a management and consulting agreement with CD&R pursuant to which CD&R provides, on a nonexclusive basis, management, consulting and advisory services to Solenis Switzerland Holdings GmbH and certain of its divisions and subsidiaries. Under the agreement, the Company is required to pay an annual advisory fee in the amount of $3.5 million plus 1% of the transaction value of any acquisitions, dispositions, or financing transactions incurred during the year for services provided (the “Advisory Fee”). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is also required to reimburse CD&R for its out-of-pocket expenses.

 Advisory fees incurred for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $3.6 million, $3.8 million and $3.7 million, respectively. These fees are included as a component of selling, general and administrative expense for all reporting periods presented.

 Transactions with CD&R or any of its affiliate companies are conducted on terms similar to those of third party transactions. For the year ended September 30, 2020, there was no purchase of goods and services from CD&R. For the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, Solenis purchased goods and services from CD&R affiliates of $3.6 million, and $2.9 million, respectively. Related to these purchases, the Company had no total payables due to affiliates of CD&R as of both September 30, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

 As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CD&R held $100.0 million of principal of the Company's Second Lien Credit Agreement. The terms of the Second Lien Credit Agreement are consistent with the unrelated lenders in the syndicate.

 Exclusive of these agreements, Solenis is not aware of any material transactions with CD&R or any of its affiliate companies which were not conducted on terms similar to those conducted with third-parties.

 Relationship with BASF

 On January 31, 2019 as part of the JV, Solenis entered into a management and consulting arrangement with BASF pursuant to which BASF provides, on a nonexclusive basis, management, consulting and advisory services to Solenis and certain of its divisions and subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Solenis is required to pay an annual

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 advisory fee in the amount of $3.5 million. The advisory fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were $3.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively, and are included as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 As part of the JV, Solenis prepaid for an option to purchase an existing BASF manufacturing facility located in Nanjing, China. This option is exercisable 36 months from the JV close date with nominal consideration due upon exercise. Due to administrative delays, Solenis did not legally acquire the Nanjing Purchase Option at close. However, the Company conveyed $59.9 million through an interest-free loan between Solenis Holdings Top I B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Solenis, and BASF NL. The promissory note held by the Company represents the estimated fair value of the Nanjing Purchase Option. Refer to Note 3 for more details. The fair value of the option of $59.9 million is included as part of Acquisition-related deposits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of both September 30, 2020, and 2019.

 As part of the closing of the Joint Venture, BASF and Solenis entered into various Supply agreements and Reverse supply agreements which provide finished goods and raw materials to each business to ensure continuity of operations. Accordingly, the JV provides that the price of the finished goods subject to Supply and Reverse Supply Agreements will be consistent with BASF's historical product costing. The difference between the estimated market price and cost is captured in the form of an asset and liability and amortized over the life of the agreement. Additional information regarding the Company's accounting policy for such arrangements can be found in Note 2 and balances within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2020, and 2019 can be found in Note 7.

 Exclusive of these agreements, Solenis is not aware of any material transactions with BASF or any of its affiliate companies which were not conducted on terms similar to those of third party transactions for the year ended September 30, 2020 or 2019.

###### Note 20  Income Taxes

 Under ASC 740, the Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of (i) temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and (ii) operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period the rate change is enacted. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

 Solenis is a limited company domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Company’s subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the U.S., U.K. and various other foreign jurisdictions, which are aggregated in the “Foreign” information captioned below.

 The Company recorded income tax expense of $6.8 million, $21.4 million and $8.6 million for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

 A summary of the provision for income taxes is as follows (in thousands):

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company had a net deferred tax asset of $7.5 million and $7.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Deferred income taxes are provided for income and expense items recognized in different years for tax and financial reporting purposes.

###### During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company effectuated mergers to combine multiple legal entities within Solenis' existing structure. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 allows the Company to recognize the full deferred tax benefit associated with such a transaction in the fiscal year in which they occur. No such transaction was undertaken during the years ended September 30, 2020 or 2019 .

 Solenis has $658.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards in various tax jurisdictions, net of unrecognized tax benefits of $17.8 million. Of this amount, $95.0 million can be carried forward indefinitely and $581.0 million expires between 2021 and 2038. These losses were assessed for realizability and any amount that is not more likely than not to be realized was offset by a valuation allowance.

 Unrecognized tax benefits

 U.S. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the accounting and financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step requires Solenis to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step requires Solenis to recognize in the financial statements each tax position that meets the more likely than not

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 criteria, measured at the amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Solenis had $42.3 million and $54.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is shown below (in thousands):

**As of September 30,**

###### Solenis recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss. Solenis had $5.4 million and $5.3 million in interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 respectively.

 The Company recognized deferred tax assets in the periods ending September 30, 2018 and 2017 related to tax benefits attributable to intercompany mergers. During 2018, the Company discovered that statutorily related filing requirements had not been timely filed. While the Company intends to pursue the matter through available legal channels, the benefits do not meet the criteria for recognition resulting in an Unrecognized Tax Benefit and similarly has not recognized benefit for the 2018 transaction. As of September 30, 2020, the Company has recorded incremental penalties and interest as a result of the previously Unrecognized Tax Benefits from the 2017 and 2018 transactions.

 As of September 30, 2020, the Company has recognized a tax indemnification asset of $3.6 million to reflect an offsetting asset for acquired non income-tax liabilities for which Solenis is indemnified. Of this amount, $1.0 million relates to the AWT purchase from Ashland and $2.6 million relates to the 2015 acquisition of a Brazilian specialty chemicals manufacturer and distributor ("Quimatec"). As of September 30, 2020, all amounts related to the uncertain tax positions, interest, and penalties have been satisfied. Pursuant to the indemnification agreements, the Company is entitled to reimbursement in connection with any negative outcome related to these liabilities generated prior to the acquisition. As future changes to the indemnity receivable will impact Non- operating expense (income), net, the Company may experience volatility in earnings as a result of the tax indemnification from Ashland/Quimatec. For the liability estimated as of September 30, 2020, it is reasonably possible that there could be material changes to the amount of uncertain tax positions due to activities of the taxing authorities, settlement of audit issues, reassessment of existing uncertain tax positions, or the expiration of applicable statute of limitations; however, Solenis is not able to estimate the impact of these items at this time.

 Solenis or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Solenis' U.S. federal and state tax returns are currently not under audit in any taxing jurisdiction. With respect to countries outside of the United States, with certain exceptions, Solenis’ foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits for years after 2013.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 The Company has not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and, at September 30, 2020, were $15.6 million. These earnings have been reinvested in active non-US business operations and the Company does not intend to repatriate these earnings to the parent entity to fund operations. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes have been provided for earnings of affiliates and associated companies where the Company plans to remit those earnings.

 U.S. Tax Reform

 On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act included significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system including, among other things, lowering the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and implementing a territorial tax system. The U.S. statutory rate has been decreased to 21% for fiscal year 2019 and thereafter. A phased in tax rate of 24.5% was utilized for the year ended September 30, 2018 due to the Company’s fiscal year versus calendar year end. In fiscal year 2018, Solenis recorded the effect of this legislation through deferred taxes as a tax benefit of $4.5 million at September 30, 2018. Certain of the Tax Act’s new provisions, including Base Erosion Anti-Avoidance Tax (“BEAT”), Interest Expense Limitations and Foreign Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) are effective beginning in fiscal year 2019. For fiscal year 2020, the Company has recorded no impact related to BEAT as the ratio of foreign payments to total deductions does not exceed the 3% base erosion percentage threshold. Additionally, no impact from FDII was recorded due to the lack of calculated deemed intangible income.

 COVID-19 Legislation

 During the year ended September 30, 2020, tax relief legislation was passed in a number of countries to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the United States’ Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020. The Company evaluated the legislative provisions in the CARES Act and implemented a number of changes deemed applicable, including the temporary increase of the interest expense limitation from 30% to 50%, the temporary removal of the 80% limitation on net operating losses, and the temporary deferral of the Company's social security tax responsibilities. The Company has reflected the impact of these changes within its consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2020. 

 Note 21  Hyperinflationary Environment in Argentina

 On May 16, 2018, as documented in its meeting minutes, the International Practices Task Force categorized Argentina as a country with a highly-inflationary economy. Accounting Standards Codification 830, Foreign Currency Matters, requires entities domiciled in these jurisdictions to change their functional currency to the reporting currency of its parent entity on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter after this determination has been made.

 Solenis Argentina, S.A. ("Solenis Argentina") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; selling direct to end customers exclusively in Argentina. The Company does not have a plant in this specific subsidiary and, accordingly, the majority of its net assets are current to support local distribution activities. Revenues specific to Solenis Argentina totaled $12.5 million, $10.5 million, and $7.6 million for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.


-----

###### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

 Transactions are predominately consummated in Argentinian Pesos (the "Peso") and, accordingly, the Peso is ordinarily the functional currency of this entity. However, in accordance with ASC 830, the Company changed the functional currency of this entity to the United States Dollar effective July 1, 2018. This change resulted in a remeasurement loss of $3.2 million, $3.1 million, and $1.4 million during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since July 1, 2018.

 The Company will continue to evaluate the inflationary environment in Argentina for any changes to this status. Until such time in which it is determined that the economy is no longer highly inflationary, the functional currency of Solenis Argentina will remain the United States Dollar.

 Note 22  Subsequent Events

 Subsequent events have been evaluated through December 8, 2020, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

International Limited and its subsidiaries, which comprise the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
June 30, 2021, and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, and of comprehensive
income (loss) for the three-month and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 and

Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the
accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial information for it to be in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

**_Other Matter_**

We previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, the consolidated balance sheet of Solenis UK International Limited and its subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income
(loss), of changes in shareholders' equity (deficit) and of cash flows for the year then ended (not presented

 Note 1  Business Background

 General Description of the Business

 Solenis UK International Limited ("Solenis" or "the Company") is domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the "UK"). The Company was formed on August 31, 2018 for the specific purpose of consummating a Joint Venture (the "Joint Venture", "JV", or "JVFA") between BASF SE ("BASF") a German- based chemical manufacturer and distributor, and the Solenis business, which was 97% owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R") and 3% owned by management immediately prior to the JV.

 Prior to the formation of the Company, the Solenis business existed under the name Solenis International LLC (formerly a limited liability company known as CD&R Seahawk Bidco, LLC and a limited partnership known as Solenis International, L.P.) ("International"), a Delaware limited liability company. International was formed on February 14, 2014 and was domiciled in the Netherlands. International and certain other holding companies and partnerships (the "Holding Companies") were formed by affiliates of CD&R. The Holding Companies, collectively, were formed for the purpose of acquiring the business of Ashland Water Technologies ("AWT"), a business formerly owned by Ashland, Inc. ("Ashland"), including certain assets of AWT and all of the capital stock and equity interests of certain entities engaged in the AWT business from Ashland. International, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, acquired AWT on July 31, 2014 for $1,734.8 million (the “Acquisition”). The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash, cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above. The Company’s global operations are conducted by wholly-owned subsidiaries.

 Immediately prior to the JV, CD&R, alongside members of the International management team, controlled 100% of the equity interests and voting rights in the Holding Companies and International. To consummate the JV, CD&R and members of the International management team sold their collective interests in International and the Holding Companies to Solenis in exchange for a 51% interest in the JV, represented by a 51% equity interest in Solenis UK International Limited, or Solenis. Historically, the combined and condensed consolidated financial statements of the Solenis business were presented at the level of International. International was the subsidiary of Solenis Holdings I Coöperatief U.A., a Dutch-domiciled holding company owned collectively by CD&R and members of the International management team. As both Solenis and Solenis Holdings I Coöperatief U.A. shared the same ultimate parent in CD&R, this transaction was accounted for as a business combination between entities under common control, as described under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, Business Combinations. In accordance with this guidance, net assets acquired maintained their predecessor values and were not assessed for or recorded at fair value.

 On January 31, 2019, BASF conveyed $678 million to Solenis in consideration of a 49% interest in the JV, represented by a 49% equity interest in Solenis UK International Limited, or Solenis. The Company subsequently contributed the $678 million of proceeds to its subsidiaries. One such subsidiary, Solenis Holdings LLC, a US- domiciled limited liability company, obtained third party debt financing proceeds of $525 million, of which $213 million was either loaned or contributed to subsidiaries of the Company and Solenis Holdings LLC. In the aggregate, the subsidiaries of the Company entered into various local asset transfer agreements with BASF through which Solenis acquired the assets of the BASF Paper and Water Chemicals Business in exchange for $891.3 million, less working capital adjustments. Through the various transactions executed on January 31, 2019, BASF sold the assets of its former Paper and Water Chemicals Business to Solenis in consideration of $891.3 million, comprised of a 49% equity interest in the Company and $213 million in cash subject to working capital adjustments. The final agreed upon purchase price was $881.7 million, inclusive of working capital adjustments.

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 As of January 31, 2019, the Company was owned by CD&R (49.5%), BASF (49%) and members of the JV management team (1.5%).

 Basis of Presentation

 Solenis' Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Solenis, including all Holding Companies. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).

 Nature of Operations

 Solenis is a leading supplier of specialty chemicals and services to the pulp and paper, mining, food and beverage, power generation, refining, chemical processing, general manufacturing and municipal markets. It offers chemical and equipment technologies and services designed to help customers improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect plant assets and minimize environmental impact.

 The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses directly attributed to Solenis.

 To meet the diverse requirements of its customers, Solenis offers a range of services, including start-up and ongoing applications support, analytical and applications laboratories and customized program offerings.

 Solenis’ products include biocides, cleaners, coagulants and flocculants, converting additives, corrosion inhibitors, defoamers, deposit control agents, food and beverage processing aids, internal and surface size agents, membrane treatments, mining and mineral processing aids, monitoring and control systems, odor inhibitors and neutralizers, oxygen scavengers, polyacrylamides, pulp mill additives, retention, drainage and clarification aids, scale inhibitors, sludge dewatering polymers, surface treatments, tissue making additives, wet- and dry-strength additives, colorants, surface size, antiscalants for desalination, and wood adhesives.

 Solenis has 41 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries. Solenis markets and distributes its products and services directly and through third-party distributors in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific.

 Solenis’ business principally consists of three operating segments: Pulp & Paper, Industrial Water, and Reverse Supply Agreements. A brief description for each of these operating segments are as follows:

 Pulp & Paper – The Pulp & Paper ("P&P") business manufactures and sells a broad array of process chemistry for the pulp and paper industry including deposit and scale control agents, defoamers, biocides, retention aids and crepe and release additives. These products are designed to deliver benefits such as enhanced operational efficiencies, system cleanliness and superior performance in a wide variety of manufacturing operations globally. In addition, the Pulp & Paper business offers functional chemistry for packaging, tissue and towel, and printing and writing producers that impart specific properties such as wet or dry strength, colorants, surface size, liquid holdout and printing ability to the final paper or board. Products and technologies include internal and surface sizing agents and wet and dry strength additives.

 Industrial Water – The Industrial Water ("IWT") business offers specialized chemicals for the utility water treatment market including influent water, boiler water, cooling water and effluent water treatments. Products include scale and corrosion inhibitors, coagulants and flocculants, biocides, defoamers, anti-scaling for desalination, membrane treatments and sludge dewatering.

 extraction and scale and corrosion inhibitors for mining and mineral processing, food processing, oil refining, chemicals processing and general manufacturing markets.

 Reverse Supply Agreements - On January 31, 2019, as part of the JV, Solenis agreed to provide certain finished goods to BASF at below-market prices, consistent with BASF's historical cost and pricing structure. Such agreements are intended to allow BASF to uninterruptedly sustain the businesses that they've retained after the acquisition which were serviced significantly by BASF Paper & Water. These arrangements and related activities comprise the Company's Reverse Supply Agreements ("RSA") segment.

 Solenis also manufactures and supplies automated equipment, including performance-based feed and control systems, proprietary monitoring devices and remote system surveillance. The utility products, services and equipment offerings are designed to protect plant assets and optimize energy, water and operational costs at customers’ facilities.

 Solenis’ results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, can have a significant effect on operations. While Solenis maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Solenis could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to environmental remediation or other matters.

 Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies

 Use of Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties

 The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computation of income tax provision, and calculation of reserves, including those for environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.

 COVID-19

 The spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, could negatively impact the Company. Any future wide-ranging health scares could potentially adversely affect Solenis' business, financial condition and results of operations. The duration and intensity of this and future disruptions is uncertain, including potential broader impacts like factory closures, reduced workforce, scarcity of raw materials and the potential disruption of transportation of goods. The Company may be indirectly impacted from the reduction of orders from customers as a result of reduced consumer spending. Given the uncertainty regarding these circumstances, the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

 Principles of Consolidation and Combination

 Solenis' Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Solenis, including all Holding Companies.

 Investments in companies in which Solenis, directly or indirectly, owns up to 50% of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 using the equity method of accounting. As a result, Solenis’ share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Solenis' share of these companies’ shareholders’ equity is included in Investments in equity affiliates in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Foreign Currency Translation

 The Company's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Shareholders’ deficit in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss).

 In circumstances where the economy in which one of the Company's subsidiaries operates is determined to be highly inflationary, the functional currency for the entity is changed to the U.S. dollar on a prospective basis. Refer to Note 20 for discussion surrounding the Company's operations in economies which have been determined to be highly inflationary.

 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

 Cash and cash equivalents represent cash in banks and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash which has a legal restriction regarding its use or withdrawal is classified as Restricted cash and is classified as Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 The below table reconciles Cash and cash equivalents to Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 (amounts in thousands):

**As of June 30,**
**2021** **2020**
Cash and cash equivalents, as reported $ 246,566 $ 371,420
Restricted cash, included in other assets 1,838 1,601
Total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash shown in the statement of cash flows $ 248,404 $ 373,021

###### Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 Receivables are recognized net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. Accounts receivable are written down or off when a portion or all of such account receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense is recorded as a component of Selling, general and administration expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Additionally, Solenis maintains various global credit insurance policies which serve to partially indemnify the Company from the risk of loss related to uncollectible trade receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is recorded on a gross basis, independent of any considerations regarding potential indemnification


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 assets resulting from successfully submitted claims under the Company's credit insurance policies. This indemnification asset is recorded as a component of Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The related benefit available to the Company for successfully submitted claims is recorded as a contra-expense as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 Inventories, net

 Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method. Inventories deemed to have costs greater than their respective market values are reduced to net realizable value as a loss in the period recognized. Inventories on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory based on anticipated demand and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss.

 Property, Plant and Equipment

 Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives by asset class are summarized below:

Buildings and building improvements 25 to 35 years
Machinery and equipment 3 to 25 years
Software 5 to 10 years

###### The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines, and technological obsolescence.

 Recorded values of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows (assets held for use) or net realizable value (assets held for sale).

 Depreciation expense is presented as a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, depending upon the use of the underlying asset. There were no impairment charges for Property, plant and equipment during the nine months ended June 30, 2021 or 2020.

 Revenue Recognition

 Revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, products are shipped and title is transferred or services are provided to customers, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Collateral is generally not required. Sales are reported net of tax assessed by qualifying governmental authorities. For consignment inventory, title and risk of loss are transferred when the products have been consumed or used in the customer’s production process.

 Solenis accrues for sales returns and other allowances based on historical experience. The Company includes the amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling fees in Net sales with costs incurred for the delivery of goods as Cost of sales within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. 


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 Expense Recognition

 Cost of sales includes material and production costs, as well as the costs of inbound and outbound freight, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, internal transfers, and all other distribution network costs. Selling, general and administrative expense includes sales and marketing costs, advertising, customer support, environmental remediation and administrative costs.

 The Company does not sell product with warranties. Accordingly, there are no liabilities for product warranties.

 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are reported as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses were $0.4 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, and were $1.0 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.

 Research and Development

 Research and development costs incurred during the normal course of business are expensed as incurred. In- process research development projects acquired in a business combination are recorded as intangible assets at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent costs related to acquire in-process research and development assets are expensed as incurred.

 Litigation

 The Company accrues for liabilities related to litigation matters when available information indicates that the liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred.

 Income Taxes

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 Where the Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company provides for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings.

 The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Additionally, the Company accrues for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The current portion of unrecognized tax benefits is included within Accounts Payable and the long-term portion is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Value Added Taxes ("VAT")

 Solenis is subject to VAT in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company’s collective global VAT positions do not have a right of offset and are netted by jurisdiction for financial statement presentation purposes.


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 The Company provides for gross asset, and gross liability positions within Prepaid expenses and other assets, and within Accrued expenses, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, the Company had gross VAT assets of $43.4 million and $29.4 million, respectively, and gross VAT liability positions of $11.1 million and $26.4 million, respectively. Within the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company presents the net change in its global VAT positions within Other assets and liabilities. For the the nine months ended June 30, 2021, and 2020, those net changes inclusive of currency translation adjustments were outflows of $29.2 million and inflows of $35.6 million.

 Accounting for Business Combinations

 The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date fair values. As applicable, any excess purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recorded as Goodwill.

 The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, involves an assessment of the factors including, but not limited to the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and an appropriate discount rate at the closing date of an acquisition. When necessary, the Company consults with external advisers to help determine fair value. For non-observable market values, the Company determines fair value using acceptable valuation principles.

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets

 In accordance with ASC 350, impairment tests are performed for goodwill and in-process research and development assets annually as of July 1 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level.

 The Company assigns goodwill to individual reporting units at the date of acquisition based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination. This assessment is based solely on the pre-acquisition expectation of revenue and free cash flow by reporting unit.

 When conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit (or asset, specific to any in-process research and development assets) is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary.

 When determined necessary under the qualitative assessment, Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The latter is determined using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for goodwill are employed and include, but are not limited to, projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors, the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant.

 For the period ending June 30, 2021 there were no triggering events.

 Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives and asset classes are as follows:


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

Customer relationships 5 to 20 years
Trademarks and trade names 3 to 20 years
Proprietary process know how 8 to 15 years
Intellectual property 3 to 15 years
Supply and reverse supply agreements 3 to 8 years
Other intangibles 3 years

###### The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

 The carrying value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, to be held and used is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value and is based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies including present value techniques.

 Commitments, Contingencies and Environmental Costs

 Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated.

 Accruals for environmental remediation are recognized when it is probable, when a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded at estimated present values based on experience, assessments and current technology, without regard to any third-party recoveries (which are recorded as assets) and are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and remediation efforts advance.

 Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits

 In connection with the acquisition of AWT, the Company assumed certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations for current and former employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries. All defined contribution pension plan obligations for current and former employees in the United States, as well as certain defined benefit and contribution pension plan obligations of former employees of non-U.S. subsidiaries, were retained by Ashland.

 In connection with the JV, certain employees of the former BASF Paper and Water Chemicals business transferred to subsidiaries of Solenis on January 31, 2019 and employment agreements were entered into between the respective parties on that date. As applicable, certain defined benefit plan obligations related to the transferred employees were acquired by the Company in connection with the JV are primarily within continental Europe. While the majority of the transferred employees are employed by Solenis' subsidiaries in the United States ("US") or the United Kingdom ("UK"), no defined benefit plan obligations were transferred to Solenis for any US, or UK based employees. Employees in these jurisdictions participate only in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans.

 Defined benefit plans specify an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The net obligation in respect of defined

 benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. These benefits are then discounted to determine the present value of the obligations and are then adjusted for the impact of any unamortized prior service costs. The net obligation is then determined with reference to the fair value of the plan assets (if any). The discount rate used is the yield on bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the obligations.

 Share-based Compensation

 The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for all options and other arrangements within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718. Awards are classified as equity if such options are settled in shares and classified as liabilities if they are settled in cash. Share-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized using the "straight-line attribution method" over the employee’s requisite service period. Awards classified as liabilities are measured for fair value at each reporting date, with any changes to fair value recognized currently in earnings based on the extent of the requisite service period elapsed. The fair value of awards classified as liabilities are presented as a component of Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Share-based awards with vesting conditions other than service are recognized over the performance period based on the probability that those conditions will be achieved.

 For additional information on the Company`s share-based compensation plan, see Note 15.

 Fair Value Measurements

 U.S. GAAP defines a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

 The following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value for assets and liabilities:

 Level 1—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

 Level 2—Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs);

 Level 3—Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities which are valued based on management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability; and

 Net Asset Value ("NAV") - The Company invests in funds which are not quoted on an active market. These funds are valued based on the underlying fair value of the funds investments less the funds liabilities or net asset value.

 Derivatives

 The Company is exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency, changes in commodity prices and credit risk. The Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuating interest rates on its long term debt and net investment hedging to mitigate foreign exchange risk

 associated with its Euro denominated net assets and third-party debt. Refer to specific discussion of these arrangements within Note 11. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as part of Cash Flows from Operations.

 Sale of Accounts Receivable

 The Company accounts for sales of accounts receivables when control of receivables is surrendered. Whether control has been relinquished requires among other considerations, an evaluation of the relevant legal considerations and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the assets transferred. Assets obtained and liabilities incurred in connection with the transfers reported as sales are initially recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value.

 Accounts receivable sold are deemed transferred to the counterparty in accordance with the prevailing purchase agreement applicable to the relevant jurisdiction. In situations where cash is immediately received from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, such cash is classified as cash received from operating activities. In situations where cash is not received immediately from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, the transfer is deemed to represent a non-cash investing activity whereby the receivable is sold for a subordinated interest in future cash collections. Ultimate collections of cash on the subordinated interest in future cash collections are treated as cash flows from investing activities.

 Announced Accounting Standards

 In May 2014, the FASB issued accounting guidance outlining a single comprehensive five step model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers (ASC 606- Revenue from Contracts with Customers, i.e. the "new revenue standard"). The new revenue standard supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, in an effort to converge the revenue recognition principles within U.S. GAAP. This new guidance also requires entities to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of qualifying revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. Entities have the option of using a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the new guidance. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05, which results in a one-year deferral of the revised revenue recognition standard and requires private issues to adopt the standard beginning in the first annual reporting period after December 15, 2019 (for Solenis this period would begin October 1, 2020). As such, the Company will adopt the standard in the current fiscal year and will have disclosures prepared on a basis consistent with the required reporting and disaggregation available for the statements issued as of, and for the year ended September 30, 2021. The Company does not anticipate material changes to its previously issued financial statements or its revenue recognition procedures though the underlying analysis is on-going. 

 During February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases". The initial guidance and the subsequent amendments and deferrals issued, require that companies recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities relative to at least all leasing arrangements with terms in excess of 12 months. The guidance is expected to eliminate the majority of off-balance sheet financing arrangements and provide clarity around actual contractual obligations of the business. This guidance is effective for all private entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. As such, the Company is currently refining its analysis and will adopt the standard during the year ended September 30, 2021.

 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." The guidance requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies for fiscal years beginning after

 December 15, 2020, but early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact this standard would have on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to the Company's processes around the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables.

 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, "Intangibles - Goodwill and other Internal-Use-Software Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract." The guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in a cloud computing arrangement service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred for an internal use software license. Capitalized implementation costs should be amortized over the term of the service agreement on a straight line basis and should be assessed for impairment in a manner similar to long-lived assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.

 In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, "Derivatives and Hedging : Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes". Previously under Topic 815, the eligible benchmark interest rates in the United States were the interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government (UST), the LIBOR swap rate, the OIS Rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Municipal Swap Rate, which was introduced in ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging: Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities (“ASU 2017-12”). The amendments in ASU 2018-16 permit the use of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. The guidance is effective at the same time as adoption of ASU 2017-12. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard.

 In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08 "Codification improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables- Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs". The amendments in this Update clarify that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. The amendments in this Update represent changes to clarify the Codification. The amendments make the Codification easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application is permitted for all other entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. All entities should apply the amendments in this Update on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard.

 In March 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-03, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Accounting Alternative for Evaluating Triggering Events". Under the previous guidance in Subtopic 350-20, Intangibles— Goodwill and Other—Goodwill, an entity is required to monitor and evaluate goodwill impairment triggering events throughout the reporting period. The amendments in this Update provide private companies and not-for- profit entities with an accounting alternative to perform the goodwill impairment triggering event evaluation as required in Subtopic 350-20 as of the end of the reporting period, whether the reporting period is an interim or annual period. Management elected not use the accounting alternative to evaluate the triggering events. Refer to "Goodwill and Intangible Assets" within Note 2 for management's current evaluation standards.

 Note 3  Business Combinations and Long-Lived Asset Acquisitions

 Asset acquisition via MFG Chemical

 On April 19, 2021, Solenis LLC, a US subsidiary of the Company, agreed to acquire a manufacturing facility and other net assets associated with the production of Anhydrides from MFG Chemical, LLC, a US-based manufacturer of specialty chemicals ("MFG"). Historically, MFG has acted as a toller of certain chemistries for the Company and it's competitors. The total purchase price is approximately $31 million subject to finalized working capital considerations and other contingencies. Of the purchase price conveyed by Solenis, $7.5 million is specific to an earnout predicated upon the production volume from the acquired manufacturing facility through December 31, 2021, and was paid into escrow at deal close. As of both the transaction date and the date these financial statements are available to be issued, management estimates the earnout is highly likely to be achieved and no cash will be returned from escrow to Solenis. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, with cash consideration allocated to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The table below presents a summary of the net assets acquired (in thousands):

Accounts receivables $ 3,094

Other current assets 925

Property, plant and equipment 28,277


Identifiable intangible assets 423

Trade payables and accrued expenses (1,164)

Other net liabilities (262)


Total consideration conveyed $ 31,293


###### Conversion of Nanjing Option to Long-Term Supply Agreement

 On April 30, 2021, Solenis Shanghai Chemicals Company Limited (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, i.e. "Solenis Shanghai") and BASF Specialty Chemicals Nanjing Company Limited ("BASF Nanjing") agreed to convert the Company's $59.9 million deposit with BASF to a long-term supply agreement (the "LTSA"). The LTSA will provide Solenis Shanghai with an uninterrupted, eight year supply of finished goods required to serve former BASF customers acquired via Solenis' acquisition of the BASF Paper and Water business in January 2019. The $59.9 million deposit was originally conveyed via Solenis Holdings Top I B.V. (a consolidated Dutch subsidiary of Solenis) to BASF Nederland B.V. ("BASF NL") in January 2019, representing the estimated residual fair value of BASF Nanjing's manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China. The deposit was conveyed with the intention between the parties of transferring asset titles and operating permits from BASF to Solenis on, or prior to, January 31, 2022, upon which the existing three-year supply agreement between BASF Nanjing and Solenis Shanghai is scheduled to expire. The deposit was originally conveyed while the parties sought to perfect their intentions of transferring legal ownership on the basis that three years would be sufficient to achieve their original intentions. Despite the intent of both parties, the possibility of permit transfer appears to be remote and as such, the parties agreed to utilize the option consideration to create a new eight year supply agreement that will supersede the existing three year agreement. In consideration of the new LTSA, BASF NL returned the $59.9 million deposit to Solenis Holding Top I B.V. who in-turn provided funds to Solenis Shanghai such that funds could be conveyed locally to BASF Nanjing in China. In addition to $59.9 million of the initial deposit, Solenis Shanghai conveyed an incremental $5.0 million of Cash representing embedded realized foreign exchange losses from the initial transaction and local transfer taxes. In consideration of the Cash paid by Solenis Shanghai, the long-term supply agreement will become effective no later than October 31, 2021. Until the effective date, the total cash conveyed will be presented as "Acquisition-related deposits" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance

 Sheet. When effective, the deposit value will be reclassified to become an intangible asset amortizable over the term of the eight-year agreement.

 Prior Year Business Combinations

 Chemsystems' Pulp and Paper Business

 On June 1, 2020, Solenis Technologies South Africa Pty Ltd., (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) acquired 100% of the assets of Chemsystems' Pulp and Paper business in South Africa. Chemsystems (a division of AECI Ltd.) is a manufacturer and distributor of specialized chemical solutions primarily serving the South African and sub-Saharan African markets. Prior to the transaction, Chemsystems was Solenis' Pulp and Paper specialty chemical distributor in Africa. The acquisition allows for Solenis to build a direct channel to customers in the African market without reliance on third parties or contractual restrictions. As the primary objective of this carve-out transaction was to acquire end-market customer relationships without increasing Solenis' physical footprint, Chemsystems agreed to continue to produce finished goods for sale to the acquired customers through a tolling agreement designed to maintain the current cash flow generation of the acquired business. Total transaction costs incurred by the Company were $0.2 million. As of September 30, 2020, the measurement period was closed. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company collected the $0.8 million working capital adjustment that was due from the sellers as of September 30, 2020 which is reflected within Cash provided by investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

 The table below presents the purchase price allocation with respect to the acquisition of Chemsystems' Pulp and Paper business (in thousands):

Accounts receivable $ 1,200

Inventories 1,820

Property, plant and equipment 468


Identifiable intangible assets 7,910

Trade payables and accrued expenses (77)

Total net assets acquired and cash conveyed $ 11,321

###### Poliquimicos

 On July 14, 2020, Solenis Technologies Mexico, S. de R.L. DE C.V. (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Poliquimicos, S.A. de C.V. (“Poliquimicos”). Headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico, Poliquimicos is a leading producer and supplier of specialized chemical solutions for water-intensive industries, including the Pulp and Paper markets in Mexico. Prior to the transaction, Poliquimicos was Solenis' Pulp and Paper specialty chemical distributor in Mexico. The business will be integrated into Solenis' existing operations as part of the Company's direct-to-market strategy and improve the Company's production capabilities in the region. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded total Goodwill of $5.5 million (of which none is tax deductible), which is primarily driven by expected revenue synergies associated with the integration of the acquired business into Solenis' existing operations.

 The final gross purchase price was $22.4 million, inclusive of $7.4 million of preexisting receivables due from the former owners which were effectively settled at close. In addition, the former owners may be entitled to incremental contingent consideration equal to a maximum of $1.8 million based on the post-combination Net sales and Gross profit of Solenis' combined Pulp and Paper business in Mexico during the two years subsequent to the close of the transaction. As of both the acquisition date, and June 30, 2021, the contingent consideration liability due to the former owners of Poliquimicos is valued at $0.6 million. As part of the transaction, a final

Working capital adjustment due from sellers 277


Less: Settled accounts receivables due from Poliquimicos at close (7,366)

Less: Cash acquired (540)

Total consideration conveyed, net of cash acquired $ 14,462

###### With respect to the intangible assets recognized during the year ended September 30, 2020, via the Company's acquisitions of Chemsystems' Pulp and Paper business and the outstanding shares of Poliquimicos, the fair value of intangible assets were estimated using an income approach, either the excess earnings method or the relief from royalty method. Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. These intangible assets collectively enable the Company to enhance its sales pipeline while manufacturing and developing new products to meet evolving business needs as well as competitively produce and sell existing products.

 Note 4  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

 Accounts receivable are carried at amounts that approximate fair value. The following table represents accounts receivable, net of allowances (in thousands):

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 Generally, the Company sells products to select, pre-approved customers whose businesses may be affected by changes in economic and market conditions. Solenis considers these factors and the unique financial conditions of each customer when establishing an allowance for losses from doubtful accounts.

###### During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company entered into various global credit insurance policies to partially mitigate the risk of loss of trade receivables. As such and on a recurring basis, the company performs an analysis of its bad debt positions to determine potential indemnification under these policies. As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company has an indemnification asset of $1.1 million and $0.7 million recorded respectively within Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, Solenis recorded a benefit of $0.2 million and $0.4 million respectively reflected as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. There is no benefit or expense recognized for the three months ended and the nine months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.

 Note 5  Sale of Trade Receivables

 On March 26, 2018, the Company sold certain accounts receivable under the terms of a Receivables Purchase Agreement ("RPA" or "Accounts Receivable Financing") with ING Luxembourg ("ING"). The RPA carried a maximum capacity of $120.0 million and was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020.

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING will continue to service non-US markets with a maximum funding capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum funding capacity carried by MUFG to serve the US market is $75 million. As of June 30, 2021, the total capacity of the amended RPA agreements among the Company, ING and MUFG is $205.9 million. both of which are scheduled to expire in March 2022.

 Through the Accounts Receivable Financing facilities with both counterparties, the Company sells eligible short- term trade receivables on the initial transfer date to either ING or MUFG in exchange for consideration inclusive of cash conveyed to Solenis (referred to as the Initial Purchase Price, or "IPP") and a beneficial interest in the receivables collected by either ING or MUFG (referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price, or "DPP"). The Company continues to service the receivables sold in connection with the arrangement. The RPA requires Solenis to pledge its cash collection accounts for the underlying receivables to ING for the non-US market and to MUFG for US markets, whereby neither the receivables sold to ING or MUFG nor the future cash collections on the sold receivables are assets of Solenis post-transfer.

 Through maturity, ING and MUFG purchases new receivables from Solenis on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the jurisdiction, in exchange for incremental DPP. These amounts are settled monthly against sold receivables which were previously collected.

 The DPP is carried at fair value, which is remeasured weekly to take into account activity during the period (the Company's interest in the newly-transferred receivables and collections on previously transferred receivables attributable to the DPP), as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. Refer to Note 11 for additional discussion surrounding the fair value of the DPP.


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 Receivables are sold to ING and MUFG with the condition that Solenis indemnify ING and MUFG in the event of non-collection. Consequently, non-collections on sold receivables could expose the Company to losses. The maximum potential loss surrounding this transaction is equal to the face amount of receivables sold. The Company has evaluated the probability of loss, concluding the risk of material losses associated with this sale is remote. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold in the arrangement for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 were $0.3 million and $1.1 million, and were $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, respectively.

###### On July 31, 2014, International and Solenis Holdings 3 LLC, then a subsidiary of International, entered into a First Lien Credit Agreement ("First Lien Credit Agreement due 2021"), comprised of a $630.0 million loan ("First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021"), a €230.0 million loan ("First Lien Euro Loan due 2021"), and a $200.0 million Revolving Credit Facility ("Revolving Credit Facility due 2019"). On that same day, International and Solenis Holdings 3 LLC entered into a Second Lien Credit Agreement comprising a $470.0 million loan (the "Second Lien Credit Agreement due 2022"). Subsequent to these transactions, the Company entered into two additional term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement due 2021: one for €85 million during the second quarter of 2015 and one for €100 million during the third quarter of 2016. These agreements are collectively referred to as the "Old Debt".

 On June 26, 2018, Solenis Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the First Lien Credit Agreement (the "First Lien Credit Agreement") which includes a $200 million Revolving Credit Facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), and a Second Lien Credit Agreement through which the company borrowed aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion, with original maturity dates of December 2023, and June 2024 for the First Lien Credit Agreement, and Second lien Credit Agreement, respectively. The First and Second Lien Credit Agreements were consummated to provide net proceeds which facilitated the Joint Venture between Solenis and BASF and allow for an extension of the terms of each of the credit agreements and the Revolving Credit Facility. These agreements are collectively referred to as the "New Debt". The proceeds from each of these borrowings were used in combination with one another to repay the remaining principal balance on the Company's Old Debt.  As part of the closing of the Joint Venture on January 31, 2019, the Company borrowed an incremental $170 million and €330 million under the First Lien Credit Agreement, and increased the borrowing capacity of the Revolving Credit Facility from $200 million to $375 million, at which time the Company borrowed an incremental $124 million on the Revolving Credit Facility. The closing of the Joint Venture also extended the maturity date of all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement (except for the Revolving Credit Facility) by

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 18 months, from December 26, 2023 to June 26, 2025, and extended the maturity date of the Second Lien Credit Agreement by 24 months, from June 25, 2024 to June 26, 2026.

 For both the June 26, 2018 refinancing and the incremental borrowing on January 31, 2019 the Company applied the guidance prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discounts related to the original borrowing. All deferred financing costs and original issue discount associated with portions of the debt determined to be modified were allocated to the First Lien Credit Agreement due 2025 and Second Lien Credit Agreement due 2026 to be amortized over the life of the associated agreements.

 On February 5, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to supplement its First Lien Credit Agreement which resulted in incremental gross proceeds of $150 million and €100 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on its Revolving Credit facility by the same amount as the incremental proceeds. An incremental debt discount of $1.3 million and incremental deferred financing costs of $1.6 million were capitalized consistent with the guidance prescribed above within ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments. All other terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement remained consistent, including but not limited to, the outstanding indebtedness thereunder being due June 26, 2025.

 On March 1, 2021, the Company and its syndicate of lenders agreed to reduce the fixed component of Solenis' debt service costs by 0.25% with respect to the First Lien Euro Loan while replacing the variable rate floor of 0.5% with zero (the "Repricing"). As the Euro London Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") remains negative as of June 30, 2021, this agreement reduced the Company's debt service costs on it's First Lien Euro Loan by 0.75%. The transaction is accounted for as a modification. As such, the Company capitalized incremental deferred financing costs of $1.0 million related to lender fees paid in connection with the transaction.

 First Lien Credit Agreement

 Obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned UK subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the "Subsidiary Guarantors"), and, solely by recourse to the equity of the Company, by Solenis UK Industries Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Solenis Holdings Sub II B.V. (collectively, the "Holdings Guarantors"). The First Lien Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions, as well as the equity of the Company held by the Holdings Guarantors. Principal is paid on the last day of each quarter in an amount equal to $2.8 million and €2.0 million for the First Lien Dollar Loan and First Lien Euro Loan, respectively.

 Interest rates on all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement are variable. The First Lien Dollar Loan carries an interest rate of 4%, plus the greater of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or 0%. Beginning on March 1, 2021 in connection with the Repricing, The First Lien Euro Loan carries an interest rate of 4.00% plus the greater of the EURIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months.

 Term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement mature on June 26, 2025. The Company is permitted to prepay all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time. Through June 30, 2021, the Company has not made any voluntary prepayments on the First Lien Loans in normal course.

 The First Lien Loans are subject to mandatory prepayments equal to 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, beginning in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company made a mandatory


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 principal prepayment of $12.4 million based on the calculation of 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow during the year ended September 30, 2020. As of September 30, 2020, the Company's Current portion of long- term debt and capital leases was inclusive of this $12.4 million conveyed during the three months ended December 31, 2020. There were no mandatory prepayments due under the First Lien Credit Agreement as of either June 30, 2021 or June 30, 2020.

 The obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are effectively senior to all of the Company's Second Lien Debt and unsecured debt, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations.

 In addition, if, at the end of any quarter, borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility exceed 35% of the aggregate amount available, or $363.7 million, the First Lien Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a condensed consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, of 7.30 to 1. The First Lien Credit Agreement also includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the nature of our business. As of June 30, 2021, the Company is in compliance with all positive and negative and affirmative covenants under the First Lien Credit Agreement.

 The Revolving Credit Facility allows maximum borrowings of $375.0 million and matures on June 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility is, at the election of the Borrower, ABR plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. As of June 30, 2021, the company had no revolver borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility.

 The Company has $363.7 million of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2023 as of June 30, 2021. This amount consisted of $375.0 million less undrawn standby letters of credit of $11.3 million.

 Second Lien Credit Agreement

 The Second Lien Credit Agreement carries the same guaranty and security package as the First Lien Credit Agreement. No principal payments are due in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement until maturity. The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on June 26, 2026.

 The Company is permitted to prepay the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. Prepayments made prior to June 26, 2020 would have incurred a 2% penalty of the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2020 but prior to June 26, 2021 would have incurred a 1% penalty on the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2021 are free of penalty. The prepayment penalty is assessed regardless of whether or not the prepayment was mandatory or voluntary.

 The interest rate on the Second Lien Credit Agreement is 8.5% plus the greater of LIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months. The Second Lien Credit Agreement is junior in priority to the First Lien Credit Agreement and senior to all other unsecured debt.

 The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the nature of our business.

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 As of June 30, 2021, there are no co-borrowers on either the First Lien Credit Agreement or the Second Lien Credit Agreement and the company is in compliance with all related covenants therein.

 Equipment Financing

 On December 31, 2019, the Company entered into a $25.0 million equipment financing (leaseback) arrangement with a third party maturing on December 31, 2023. In accordance with ASC 840-40-25-5, Sale-Leaseback Transactions, the transaction was accounted for as a financing arrangement and is reflected as debt on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of both June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020. Solenis did not account for this transaction as a "sale" as the Company retains the risks and benefits of ownership during the term of the arrangement and has a bargain-purchase option at maturity to re-acquire legal title to the collateralized assets. In connection with the transaction, the Company paid $0.5 million in deferred financing fees which were capitalized at the transaction date and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement.

 Deferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount

 The composition of Deferred Financing Costs and the Original Issue Discount which remain capitalized as of June 30, 2021 are derived from a variety of sources. Specifically, those sources are as follows:

 • Financing costs and original issue discount incurred directly with the First and Second Lien Credit agreements, as part of the borrowings completed on June 26, 2018, January 31, 2019, February 5, 2020 and with respect to the Repricing as of March 1, 2021;

 • Financing costs and original issue discount carried over from the Old Debt related to portions which were determined to be modified. These amounts generally relate to portions of the debt held by lenders who participated in both syndicates comprising the Old Debt and the June 26, 2018 borrowing;

 • Financing fees paid in connection with December 31, 2019 Equipment Financing.

 As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, unamortized deferred financing costs relative to the Company’s outstanding debt consisted of the following (in thousands):

###### The fair values of Solenis' primary term debt instruments are based on estimates using quoted market prices and pricing models that take into account the present value of future cash flows as of the respective balance sheet date. The Company's believes that these instruments qualify as Level 2 measurements. The carrying amounts of the remainder of Solenis' debt and capital lease obligations approximate fair value due to their primarily short-term nature.

 Derivatives and Hedging Activities

 In order to reduce the Company's exposure to fluctuations in the cash flows associated with changes in interest rates, Solenis may create offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

 In November 2014, the Solenis entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge interest rate exposure related to a portion of the Company's long-term debt. As a result of these arrangements, the Company effectively


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 converted $440.0 million of its US Dollar denominated debt from a floating interest rate to a fixed LIBOR rate of 2.59% for a 2.5 year period from November 30, 2016 through May 30, 2019.

 On June 26, 2018, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company entered into the First and Second Lien Credit Agreements, the proceeds from which were used to pay off outstanding principal amounts on the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021. More information regarding this refinancing event can be found in Note 10. Despite the payoff of the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2021, (i) the Company still bore interest rate risk exposure through its wholly- owned subsidiary; (ii) the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2023 still carried an outstanding principal balance in excess of the $440.0 million notional amount in the interest rate and; (iii) interest payments under the First Lien Dollar Loan due 2023 carried a variable interest rate tied to LIBOR. As such, the Company determined that the hedge continued to be effective after the refinancing and, therefore, Solenis continued to apply cash flow hedge accounting through the maturity date of the swaps. As of May 30, 2019, these swaps were effectively settled with no amounts due to, or due from the counterparty.

 During the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million. As a result of these arrangements, the Company collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.26%, 3.12%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36- month period from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022.

 These contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. On both a retrospective and prospective basis, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss or income until the settlement of the related business transaction at which time the accumulated gain or loss from the contracts will be reclassified into earnings. There was no ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument recognized during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 or 2020, respectively.

 For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company reclassified expense of $13.1 million and $5.9 million, respectively from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations based on the paid and accrued interest recognized on the Company's interest rate swap liability.

 As of June 30, 2021, the Company expects losses of $18.2 million presented within Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) to be reclassified to net income or loss during the next 12 months.

 mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with these loans on a go-forward basis, management determined to pursue solutions without incurring the cost or underlying risks associated with derivative financial instruments.

 Effective April 1, 2021, the Company determined to utilize an intercompany Euro denominated note between two downstream consolidated subsidiaries to act as a hedging instrument in response to the foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's consolidated EUR net asset exposure (i.e. the "hedged item"). The intercompany note will act as a "Net Investment Hedge" through which changes in the USD equivalent of the intercompany note will be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income rather than through the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as is common for foreign currency denominated monetary instruments. The use of an intercompany note is permissible under ASC 815-20, Derivatives, only to the extent that the intercompany note reflects the consolidated foreign exchange risk of the consolidated company, and the entity party to the third-party debt instrument is the counterparty to the intercompany note designated as a hedging instrument. As of April 1, 2021 and through June 30, 2021, Solenis meets both of these criteria required to assume a net investment hedge.

 Each month, Solenis redesignates a specific amount of Euro denominated intercompany notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro net assets. The company's designation is limited to the lowest value in the subset of data points among: 1) The total Euro value of the intercompany note outstanding, 2) The total Euro value of Solenis' consolidated First Lien Euro Loans, and 3) The total Euro value of Solenis' net assets in consolidated subsidiaries that utilize a Euro functional currency. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has designated EUR 772.6 million of its intercompany Euro notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with the Company's 772.6 million of consolidated Euro net assets (relative to total First Lien Euro Loans of EUR 779.3 million). During the three months ended June 30, 2021, Solenis recognized Other Comprehensive Loss of $14.4 million as a result of its net investment hedge, effectively representing deferrals of foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the Company's First Lien Euro Loans. No reclassification of Other Comprehensive Losses specific to the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during the next 12 months.

###### Deferred Purchase Price on Accounts Receivable Financing

 On March 26, 2018, the Company entered into an arrangement to sell accounts receivable under the terms of a RPA with ING. The RPA carried a maximum capacity of $120.0 million and was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. Refer to Note 5 for additional details.

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING will continue to service non-US markets for the maximum capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum RPA capacity carried by MUFG is $75 million to serve the US market. The total capacity of the RPA agreements among the Company, ING and MUFG is $205.9 million. The RPA agreement with MUFG and the amended RPA agreement with ING are scheduled to expire in March of 2022. Refer to Note 5, Sale of Trade Receivables for additional details.

 Initial consideration received from ING and MUFG through the Accounts Receivable Financing included a subordinated interest in transferred receivables collected, referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price. The DPP is carried at fair value and is remeasured weekly to reflect activity during the period (i.e. the Company's interest in subsequently-transferred receivables and collections on receivables previously sold to ING or MUFG) as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. The fair value of the DPP is predicated upon the underlying receivables which have been transferred to ING or MUFG. As the underlying receivables represent the Company's customers with the highest credit quality and are generally collectible within 90 days, the Company expects the fair value of the DPP to be equal to its face value.

 Receivables under the Accounts Receivable Financing are transferred to ING or MUFG daily, weekly, or monthly in accordance with the prevailing agreement for each jurisdiction. The consideration for the transfer of these receivables is incremental DPP to be settled at each settlement date, as defined in the RPAs.

 As the receivables transferred to ING and MUFG do not have an active market for equivalent or similar assets, the Company's fair value assessment is predicated upon its own history of collection surrounding the specific customers' receivables which have been transferred. Accordingly, such inputs qualify as Level 3 inputs. Due to the high credit quality and the relatively short-term nature of the underlying receivables, fluctuations in credit quality are expected to have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the DPP.

 As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the DPP is carried at $185.9 million and $164.5 million, respectively. These amounts are included in Sold receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Note 12  Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation

 Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments

 In connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture with BASF on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a number of "take or pay" contracts (the "Supply Agreements") through which BASF will make certain materials required to service acquired BASF legacy customers available to Solenis based upon a combination of legacy BASF volumes for these materials and available manufacturing capacity. The term of these agreements is either three (the "Medium Term"), or eight years (the "Long Term"). Upon maturity, each of the Medium Term agreements will automatically extend for 12 months on a revolving basis unless either party provides 24 months notice of their intention to exit the agreement. There is no penalty for either party to exit provided the 24 month notice period is met. Upon maturity, each of the Long Term agreements will expire immediately unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Solenis and BASF.

 Given the substantial capital and working capital requirements necessary to maintain available capacity and meet Solenis' purchasing requirements, the Company is required to remit minimum monthly payments (the "Fixed Manufacturing Costs") designed to cover BASF's plant overhead costs specific to the impacted production lines. The monthly payments are fixed and determinable, based on allocations of BASF's heritage costing structure relative to expected production and volumes and vary only based upon annual changes in inflation rates observable in the public domain.

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 Fixed Manufacturing Costs are recognized as a component of Cost of sales on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. Total Fixed Manufacturing Costs incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $18.7 million and $17.7 million, respectively. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, total Fixed Manufacturing Costs were both $56.4 million, respectively.

 Future minimum Fixed Manufacturing Costs as of June 30, 2021 are as follows (in thousands):

 Environmental Remediation

 Due to the nature of Solenis' business, the Company is subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety. The total reserves for environmental remediation reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries.

 Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate its share of the costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multi- party sites. 

 Under the terms of the initial carve-out from Ashland, the Company is indemnified for certain pre-existing environmental remediation costs. Certain of these indemnified costs are required to exceed a deductible of 2% of the purchase price paid in the acquisition in order for indemnification to be available.

 In connection with the JV, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis. During the diligence process related to the acquisition, Solenis performed diligence related to potential environmental or other continent liabilities. As no probable or estimable exposure existed at the acquisition date, Solenis is not indemnified with respect to any environmental or other contingent matters. As of both June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company does not have material contingent obligations which are both probable and estimable related to these production facilities, transferred employees, or other real property acquired from BASF.

 As of both June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company has recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, related to two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. These reserves are


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 included as part of other non-current liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Given the limited time frame over which remediation activities are expected to be performed, the Company has not discounted any projected future cash outflows in determining these reserves as of June 30, 2021.

 Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million relates to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million relates to management's best estimate for potential exposure related to ground contamination at the Company's Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a potential Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management's best estimate of total expenses to be incurred, made with the assistance of a third-party specialist.

 Indemnification assets associated with environmental remediation claims are recorded on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as part of Other assets in the amount of $1.1 million as of both June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

 Other Legal Proceedings

 In addition to the matters described above, there are various claims, lawsuits and administrative proceedings that are pending or threatened. Such actions seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts.

 The Company has accrued for legal reserves of $3.3 million as of both June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. While Solenis cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, the Company believes that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions.

 In addition to its uncertain tax positions, the Company has accrued for various contingent liabilities related to indirect taxes. As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company has accrued for potential exposure related to these positions of $5.7 million, of which Solenis is indemnified for $3.6 million by the former owners of Solenis' business combinations since inception. As of both June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, these obligations and the related indemnification assets are recorded as a component of Other non-current liabilities, and Other assets, respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Insurance

 Solenis maintains deductibles for general liability, business interruption and property damage to owned, leased and rented property. These deductibles could be material to our earnings, but they are not material to our overall financial position. The Company carries substantial excess general liability, property and business interruption insurance above our deductibles. In addition, Solenis meets all statutory requirements for automobile liability and workers’ compensation.

 Note 13  Shareholders' (Deficit)

 As of June 30, 2021, the Company had 81,809,819 shares of $1 par value Ordinary shares issued and outstanding. The holders of the Company's Ordinary shares are entitled to one vote per share and are entitled to dividends or returns of capital as declared by the Company's board of directors. The board of directors have no limit to the number of Ordinary shares they are authorized to issue. Management has legally assigned the voting rights associated with their shares to CD&R. Despite this, Management has retained all other rights associated with such shares.

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 The Company's Ordinary shares are the only classification of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2021. The Company's board of directors reserve the right to create and designate a new class of common shares at their discretion with necessary shareholder approval. The designations, powers, preferences, voting rights, privileges, options, conversion rights, and other special rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof shall be designated by the board of directors.

 The Company has no Preferred shares.

 Class A, Class B, and Ordinary Shares

 On July 31, 2014, CD&R contributed $405.0 million of cash to the Holding Companies in exchange for 40,500,000 of Class A shares of Common stock in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. No additional Class A shares were purchased or sold prior to the closing of the Joint Venture.

 Between July 31, 2014 and the closing of the Joint Venture, members of Management purchased Class B shares of Common stock in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. As of the date of the Joint Venture, 1,261,829 Class B shares were outstanding.

 On December 27, 2017, Solenis I Coopertief U.A. issued a return of capital in kind to CD&R totaling $400.0 million. The return of capital was issued in the form of a note payable. On April 4, 2018, the Board of Directors of Solenis Holdings I Coopertief U.A. passed a resolution to recapitalize $405.1 million representing the initial note payable and related interest accrued. On May 1, 2018 Solenis Holdings Top I B.V. issued a return on capital of $400.0 million in the form of a note payable maturing on April 30, 2020 to CD&R. 

 On January 31, 2019, CD&R exchanged their 40,500,000 shares of Class A Common stock in exchange for 35,624,716 Ordinary shares of Solenis UK International Limited. Additionally, CD&R received $303.0 million in cash which represented a partial repayment of the $400.0 million on the note payable due from Solenis Holding Top I B.V. The $303.0 million in cash paid constitutes $293.4 million in partial repayment of principal and $9.6 million of accrued interest. CD&R exchanged the remaining balance of $106.6 million principal outstanding on the note payable for 6,137,113 Ordinary shares in Solenis. This transaction was financed using proceeds from the Incremental Borrowings.

 On January 31, 2019, Management exchanged their 1,261,829 shares of Class B Common stock in exchange for 1,261,829 Ordinary shares of Solenis and $9.4 million of cash. In order to avoid a dilutive adjustment in accordance with the provision of the Plan, management shareholders received a $4.4 million incremental return of capital during the year ended September 30, 2019.

 On January 31, 2019, as part of consideration transferred to acquire BASF Paper & Water, Solenis issued 40,113,302 Ordinary shares and $203.8 million in cash to BASF. The fair value of the Ordinary shares conveyed, based upon the total equity value of the combined business, exclusive of expected synergies, was $677.8 million.

 Treasury Stock

 The Company repurchases shares from directors and officers who leave the Company within three months of their departure and from persons who exercise options one year after the exercise date. Treasury shares are not retired and are not available for re-issuance. Treasury stock is accounted under the cost method.


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 As of June 30, 2021, the Company has repurchased 802,281 of Class B Shares and 946,446 Ordinary shares from former management shareholders. As of September 30, 2020, the Company has repurchased 802,281 of Class B Shares and 315,868 Ordinary shares from former management shareholders.

 Note 14 Restructuring and Severance Activities

 The Company's strategic growth objectives either through acquisition or organic opportunities are partially driven by cost synergies which reduce the long-term costs required to serve Solenis' customers. These long-term cost synergies are often actioned through specific reductions in force. As a result of these programs, Solenis incurred severance charges of $0.7 million and $4.4 million, during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of the total severance charges incurred, the amounts reflected within Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during both the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were less than $0.1 million.

 Solenis incurred severance charges of $4.9 million and $6.1 million, during the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of the total severance charges incurred, the amounts reflected within Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during both the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were less than $0.1 million.

 Severance reserves are included in Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. The following table details the amount and activity of severance reserves related to these programs (in thousands):

**Severance Reserves**
Balance as of September 30, 2019 $ 5,995
Severance charges 21,272
Utilization (cash paid or otherwise settled) (10,891)

###### Severance activities during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 were primarily related to cost rationalization projects in response to COVID-19 and planned reductions in force in connection with the synergy objectives for the JV.

 Note 15  Share-based Compensation

 Stock Incentive Plan

 Effective July 8, 2014, the Company's board of directors adopted the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to which the Company's board of directors shall select officers and key employees and directors to participate in the plan and grant stock options and offer opportunities to purchase shares. The plan allows for the issuance of up to 6,500,000 Class B shares under the plan (for all share-based compensation and share purchases). All stock options granted have a term not greater than ten years. Stock options vest and become exercisable, in whole or in part, with vesting conditions set by the Company's board of directors.


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 The options are provided in two separate grants which have differing vesting conditions. Service Options, which reflect 75% of all options granted, vest in four equal annual installments, coinciding with the first anniversary date of the grant date and each successive anniversary thereafter. Performance Options, which represent the remaining 25% of the options granted, vest upon the conclusion of each of the four fiscal years subsequent to the grant date based on the achievement of specified "EBITDA" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; subject to management adjustments) targets during the fiscal year in which they vest. The extent of vesting is based on the Company's financial performance relative to EBITDA targets stipulated by the Board of Directors. The vesting of both Service and Performance Options are contingent upon continuous employment through the respective measurement dates.

 On January 31, 2019, the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan was superseded by the Solenis UK International Limited Stock Incentive Plan ("the Plan") as part of the closing of the Joint Venture. All outstanding Service Options to purchase shares in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. were converted to options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. Service Options which were vested were exchanged for fully vested options. Unvested Service Options were exchanged for Service Options with identical vesting periods to the canceled awards. As of June 30, 2021, 171,783 shares or options were available for grant.

 In connection with the JV, all holders of Class A and B shares were provided with a return of capital conveyed in cash to facilitate the required equity holdings amongst the JV participants (CD&R, BASF and management shareholders). In addition, and to uphold the anti-dilutive provision of the Plan, the intrinsic value of all Class B options was kept constant through a reduction of option exercise prices equal to the per-share value of the return of capital conveyed to all Class A and B equity holders. In circumstances where this was not possible due to limitations under Section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company compensated option holders in cash totaling $4.4 million. This cash is considered to be a return of capital and presented as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 The Company applied the guidance prescribed by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding the cancellation of the old awards and simultaneous grant of new awards. Based on the prescribed guidance, the Company determined that the two transactions, in combination, represent a modification of the original award. Subsequent accounting for modifications is predicated upon the fair value of the original award immediately before and the new award immediately after the modification. Management's analysis concluded that the fair value of the new award did not exceed the fair value of the old award on the modification date. Therefore, the Company will continue to ratably recognize the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the original awards based on the fair value of the awards as of the original grant date over the remaining vesting period.

 Compensation expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $1.7 million, and $1.4 million.

 In addition, as part of the closing of the Joint Venture, all unvested Performance Options to purchase shares in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. were canceled and new Performance Options were granted to replace the canceled awards. The exchange of Service and Performance Options for new awards are collectively referred to as the "Modification".

 Stock Options

 Stock incentive plan allows stock option grants for shares at a price based on the most recent valuation of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of the grant and may be subject to anti-dilution. Stock options under the plan become exercisable over four equal annual installments. Every option equals one share. Our policy is to


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

 Share-based compensation expense is recognized as a component of Selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company records compensation expense related to all stock awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards. Compensation expense for Service Options is recognized over the requisite service period, while expense for Performance Options is recognized over the performance period based on successful achievement of performance-based conditions or targets. 

 Stock option activity for Service and Performance Options from September 30, 2019 through June 30, 2021 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands except for per option data):

###### The per-option weighted average grant-date fair value of Service options granted during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were $5.74 and $5.73, respectively.

 There per-option weighted average grand-date fair value of performance options granted the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 was $5.53 and there were no performance options granted during the the three months ended June 30, 2020.

 The fair value assumptions used to arrive at this fair value using Black-Scholes inputs are as follows:


-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

**June 30, 2021**

**Service-Based** **Performance-**
**options** **Based options**


Weighted average expected dividends —% —%

Weighted average expected volatility 33% 33%

Weighted average risk free rate 0.7% 0.6%

Weighted average expected life (in years) 6.3 4.8

###### To estimate the expected life for stock option term, the Company used the simplified method as the awards were granted at fair value and Solenis, a privately-held company, has limited exercise history. The risk-free rates for periods within the expected life of the awards are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 The board of directors does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero. Volatility is based upon peer groups as the Company is privately-held. As Solenis is not publicly traded, the market value of the stock is estimated based upon third-party valuations. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 respectively, Solenis received cash of $2.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively for the exercise of stock options.

 Stock Appreciation Rights

 Certain employees were granted Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), representing stock awards to be settled in cash. The Company recognized these as liability-classified awards in accordance with ASC 718. Consistent with our equity based awards, the Company has SARs which vest in accordance with service ("Service SARs") and performance ("Performance SARs") conditions. SAR based compensation is included as a part of Selling, general, and administrative expenses.

 Like the Service Options, Service SARs originally issued as part of the Plan which participated in the appreciation of the price of Class B Shares were converted to rights to participate in share price appreciation of the Company's Ordinary shares. Vested SARs were converted to vested SARs and unvested SARs were converted to SARs with identical vesting and other contractual conditions. Strike prices were revised in accordance with the Plan's anti- dilution provision.

 Like the Performance Options, all Performance SARs were canceled as of the Modification date. 1,600 Performance SARs have been granted during the nine months ended June 30, 2021.

 Stock appreciation rights issued under the plan are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using Black- Scholes inputs applicable at the reporting date. Differences in fair value between reporting dates are recognized in earnings as part of Selling, general, and administrative expense to the extent that awards have vested or are expected to vest. 

 As of June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, the fair value of SARs outstanding were $0.6 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The fair value of SARs outstanding are included as part of Accrued expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020. All outstanding SARs were exercisable as of June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020.

 Restricted Stock Units

 In February 2020, certain members of the management team were granted a total of 1.1 million Restricted Stock Units (RSU) with a term of seven years and vesting contingent upon a combination of a liquidation event (Performance Obligation), the implied per-share equity value of the liquidation event at a pre-defined minimum threshold amount (Market Condition), and that a grantee continues to render service until the date of the liquidation event (Service Condition).

 Vesting of the RSU's range between 70% - 100%, where 70% is at minimum pre-defined exit price per share and 100% is at maximum pre-defined exit price per share.

 In the event of vesting, grantees shall receive cash proceeds within 75 days of the liquidity event. Although, at the discretion of the Board, the cash proceeds may be required for an equity contribution back to the Company. Grantees that leave the Company either voluntarily or involuntarily prior to vesting conditions are met will forfeit their respective grants.

 In March 2021, certain members of the management team were granted a total of 0.5 million RSU's with a term of seven years and vesting contingent upon the Company achieving certain EBITDA targets.

 In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, vesting of these awards is contingent upon performance obligations and market conditions which are outside of management's control and such conditions cannot be assumed or estimated based on lack of history and potential outcomes. As the likelihood of achievement of the Performance condition cannot be assessed as "probable", no compensation expense will be recognized until the performance condition is achieved. As such, no expense was recognized with respect to these awards during the nine months ended June 30, 2021.

###### For the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company recognized unrealized gains of $6.0 million, and losses of $11.2 million, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 the Company recognized unrealized gains of $26.2 million, and losses of $40.5 million, respectively. For both periods, these gains and losses were primarily as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates associated with Solenis' Euro-denominated debt as well as the net impact of foreign currency denominated intercompany positions for which the residual foreign exchange impact is reflected in earnings.

 During the three months ended June 30, 2021, Solenis deconsolidated the net assets of Solenis Trinidad and Tobago Limited ("Solenis Trinidad") resulting from a loss of control in anticipation of a full liquidation of the net assets of the entity. As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recognized a loss of $18.0 equal to the difference between the fair value of Solenis' residual non-controlling interest and the previously consolidated net assets of Solenis Trinidad. Refer to Note 21 for additional details.

 Note 18  Related Parties

 Since January 31, 2019, and as of June 30, 2021, voting control in Solenis is held collectively by CD&R which owns 49.5% of all outstanding shares, and management which owns 1.5% of the outstanding shares. Management

 has legally assigned their voting rights to CD&R, allowing CD&R to 51% control of outstanding voting rights. As a result of the JV, BASF owns 49% of the outstanding shares of Solenis.

 Relationship with CD&R

 On July 31, 2014, International, through its subsidiary, Solenis Switzerland Holdings GmbH, entered into a management and consulting agreement with CD&R pursuant to which CD&R provides, on a nonexclusive basis, management, consulting and advisory services to Solenis Switzerland Holdings GmbH and certain of its divisions and subsidiaries. Under the agreement, the Company is required to pay an annual advisory fee in the amount of $3.5 million plus 1% of the transaction value of any acquisitions, dispositions, or financing transactions incurred during the year for services provided (the “Advisory Fee”). Under the terms of the agreement, the Company is also required to reimburse CD&R for its out-of-pocket expenses.

 Advisory fees incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were both $0.9 million. These fees are included as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense for all reporting periods presented. Advisory fees incurred during the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were both $2.7 million. These fees are included as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense for all reporting periods presented.

 Transactions with CD&R or any of its affiliate companies are conducted on terms similar to those of third party transactions. For the three months ended and the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there was no purchase of goods and services from CD&R or its affiliates or sales of goods and services to CD&R or its affiliates. The Company had no total payables due to or receivables due from affiliates of CD&R as of both June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, respectively.

 As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CD&R held $100.0 million of principal of the Company's Second Lien Credit Agreement. The terms of the Second Lien Credit Agreement are consistent with the unrelated lenders in the syndicate.

 Exclusive of these agreements, Solenis is not aware of any material transactions with CD&R or any of its affiliate companies which were not conducted on terms similar to those conducted with third-parties.

 Relationship with BASF

 On January 31, 2019 as part of the JV, Solenis entered into a management and consulting arrangement with BASF pursuant to which BASF provides, on a nonexclusive basis, management, consulting and advisory services to Solenis and certain of its divisions and subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Solenis is required to pay an annual advisory fee in the amount of $3.5 million. The advisory fees incurred during the three months ended were both $0.9 million, and during the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were both $2.7 million, respectively, and are included as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 As part of the JV, Solenis prepaid for an option to purchase an existing BASF manufacturing facility located in Nanjing, China. This option was exercisable 36 months from the JV close date with nominal consideration due upon exercise. Due to administrative delays, Solenis did not legally acquire the Nanjing Purchase Option at close. However, the Company conveyed $59.9 million through an interest-free loan between Solenis Holdings Top I B.V., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Solenis, and BASF NL. The promissory note held by the Company represented the estimated fair value of the Nanjing Purchase Option. The fair value of the option of $59.9 million was included as part of Acquisition-related deposits on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2020. As discussed within Note 3, Solenis and BASF agreed to convert the deposit value to a

 long-term supply agreement during the three months ended June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the cash consideration paid to BASF specific to the long-term supply agreement is reflected as an Acquisition-related deposit on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet and will be reclassified to reflect the acquisition of an intangible asset upon the effective date of the long-term supply agreement which is based upon the earlier of a series of events outside of Solenis' control, or October 31, 2021.

 As part of the closing of the Joint Venture, BASF and Solenis entered into various Supply agreements and Reverse supply agreements which provide finished goods and raw materials to each business to ensure continuity of operations. Accordingly, the JV provides that the price of the finished goods subject to Supply and Reverse Supply Agreements will be consistent with BASF's historical product costing. The difference between the estimated market price and cost is captured in the form of an asset and liability and amortized over the life of the agreement. Additional information regarding the Company's accounting policy for such arrangements can be found in Note 2 and balances within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020 can be found in Note 7.

 Exclusive of these agreements, Solenis is not aware of any material transactions with BASF or any of its affiliate companies which were not conducted on terms similar to those of third party transactions for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 or 2020.

(benefit)


Effective income tax rate 659.5 % (160.4) % 51.4 % (1.3) %

###### Income tax provision increased $13.1 million to an expense of $17.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the expense of $4.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020. The Company's effective income tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2021 was 659.5% compared to (160.4)% for the three months ended June 30, 2020.

 Income tax provision increased by $32.0 million to an expense of $32.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021, as compared to the expense of $0.7 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The Company's

 effective income tax rate for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was 51.4% compared to (1.3)% for the nine months ended June 30, 2020.

 The Company's income tax benefit and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax laws, and certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.

 Note 20  Hyperinflationary Environment in Argentina

 On May 16, 2018, the International Practices Task Force categorized Argentina as a country with a highly- inflationary economy. Accounting Standards Codification 830, Foreign Currency Matters, requires entities domiciled in these jurisdictions to change their functional currency to the reporting currency of its parent entity on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter after this determination has been made.

 Solenis Argentina, S.A. ("Solenis Argentina") is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; selling direct to end customers exclusively in Argentina. The Company does not have a plant in this specific subsidiary and, accordingly, the majority of its net assets are current to support local distribution activities. Revenues specific to Solenis Argentina totaled shown as below (in thousands):

**For the three months ended June 30,** **For the nine months ended June 30,**

**2021** **2020** **2021** **2020**


Net Sales $ 3,464 $ 2,925 $ 9,679 $ 9,513


###### Transactions are predominately consummated in Argentinian Pesos (the "Peso") and, accordingly, the Peso is ordinarily the functional currency of this entity. However, in accordance with ASC 830, the Company changed the functional currency of this entity to the United States Dollar effective July 1, 2018. This change resulted in a remeasurement gains and losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since July 1, 2018. Remeasurement gains and losses are summarized as below (in thousands):

**For the three months ended June 30,** **For the nine months ended June 30,**

**2021** **2020** **2021** **2020**


Remeasurement loss (gain) $ (1,040) $ 2,318 $ (1,894) $ 1,189


###### The Company will continue to evaluate the inflationary environment in Argentina for any changes to this status. Until such time in which it is determined that the economy is no longer highly inflationary, the functional currency of Solenis Argentina will remain the United States Dollar.

 Note 21 Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries

 On January 4, 2021, the directors of Solenis Trinidad and Tobago Limited (a subsidiary of the Company, i.e. "Solenis Trinidad") passed a special resolution to commence liquidation procedures via a "voluntary members winding-up". To facilitate the liquidation, the directors appointed a third-party administrator on the same date and effectively relinquished control of Solenis Trinidad. As such and in accordance with ASC 810-10-40

-----

###### Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited]

 Consolidation (and Derecognition), management determined the loss of control requires the deconsolidation of the subsidiary and a write-off of the previously consolidated net assets. Upon deconsolidation, the Company recorded a loss of $18.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2021, reflected within Non-operating (expense) income on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. In consideration of the liquidation efforts, the Company recorded the residual fair value of its non-controlling interest of $2.5 million, equal to the value of cash on hand and other net working capital items controlled by the administrator which were previously reflected on the balance sheet of Solenis Trinidad in consolidation. The fair value of the non-controlling interest is reflected within Other Current Assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021. Management anticipates the liquidation procedures will be completed by December 31, 2021.

 Resulting from the liquidation, Management reviewed the criteria for the presentation of results within discontinued operations as reflected within ASC 205-20- Discontinued Operations, noting that Solenis Trinidad represents less than 1% of the Company's total assets and annualized revenues and accordingly, the liquidation does not represent a "strategic shift" required to present items within discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of Solenis Trinidad are reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to January 4, 2021.

 Note 22  Subsequent Events

 On July 3, 2021, the Company and it's beneficial owners (CD&R Seahawk Holdings, L.P. and BASF Nederland B.V., on behalf of CD&R, BASF, and Management equity holders) executed the Securities Purchase Agreement (the "SPA") with Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. (a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership on behalf of Platinum Equity, a global Private Equity firm based in the United States) to sell 100% of the equity in Solenis for an enterprise value of $5.25 billion. Residual proceeds available to current equity holders are expected to be conveyed net of considerations for indebtedness and working capital adjustments. The transaction is expected to close on or around October 1, 2021.

 Subsequent events have been evaluated through September 6, 2021, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued.

notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements.

**Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements**

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal
control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error.

**Auditor’s Responsibility**

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of
material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the
auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements
in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion.

**Opinion**

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
financial position of Innovative Water Care Global Corporation at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the consolidated
and combined results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, consolidated for the

**Innovative Water Care Global Corporation**

**NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**For the year ended December 31, 2020, the period from March 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 (successor) and**
**the period from January 1, 2019 to February 28, 2019 (predecessor)**

**_(Tabular dollar amounts in thousands, except as indicated)_**

**Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Principles**

**_Organization and Description of the Business_**

Innovative Water Care Global Corporation (“IWC” or “we” or “our” or the “Company”), doing business as Sigura, is
one of the world’s leading suppliers of sanitizers and other treatment chemicals for pools, spas and industrial water
applications. We maintain six production facilities throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Africa and
sales locations in all major regions globally. We have three manufacturing facilities that primarily produce calcium
hypoclorite for water treatment and three packaging plants that produce finished products for sale to customers.

**_Acquisition by Platinum Equity Capital Partners IV, L.P._**

On February 28, 2019, IWC, through its indirect majority parent, Platinum Equity Capital Partners IV, L.P. (hereafter
“Platinum Equity”) completed the acquisition of the water treatment business (“Water Care”) from Lonza Group AG
(“Lonza”) for $622.9 million, (hereafter the “Transaction”). The acquisition by IWC was accounted for in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) and we have elected to adopt
push-down accounting in the accompanying financial statements under ASU 2014-17 and ASC 805-50-3010. Accordingly, in the accompanying December 31, 2019 consolidated balance sheet, the consideration transferred in
connection with the acquisition has been “pushed down” to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recorded at
fair value in accordance with ASC 805. Due to the impact of the acquisition and push down accounting, the Company’s
consolidated and combined financial statements and certain note presentations for the year ended December 31, 2019,
are presented in two distinct periods to indicate the application of a different basis of accounting between the periods
presented: (1) the period up to and including the acquisition date (January 1, 2019 through February 28, 2019, labeled
“Predecessor”) and (2) the period after that date (March 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, labeled “Successor”). As
a result of the foregoing, the accompanying consolidated and combined financial statements are not comparable and are
separated by a black line.

See also Note 2 – Acquisition by Platinum Equity for further information.

**_Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Policy_**

The consolidated and combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Prior to the acquisition by IWC, the Water Care business did not exist as a separate reporting group. Therefore, the
period January 1, 2019 to February 28, 2019 included within these financial statements and notes to the financial
statements represent the historical combined and “carve-out” activity of the Water Care business during the Predecessor
period in which it was owned by Lonza. Prior to the acquisition, certain corporate, and general and administrative
expenses of Lonza were allocated to the Water Care business primarily on the basis of the proportion of net sales of the
Water Care business versus non-Water Care. In the opinion of management, such an allocation is reasonable. However,
such expenses are not indicative of, nor is it practical or meaningful for management to estimate for the historical period
presented, the actual level of expenses that might have been incurred had the Water Care business been operating as an
independent company. General corporate overhead primarily includes information technology, finance and accounting,
human resources, regulatory and legal.


-----

**_Use of Estimates and Assumptions_**

The preparation of our consolidated and combined financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates,
and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant management judgment is required in determining
the accounting for, among other things, pension and postretirement benefits, purchase price allocations, useful lives for
depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for tangible and intangible longlived assets, goodwill, income taxes, contingencies, inventory obsolescence and market reserves and the valuation of
share-based compensation.

Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as
economic disruption, uncertainty, and volatility. If the pandemic persists or worsens, the Company’s operations could
be negatively affected, and there could be an adverse impact on the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our
consolidated and combined financial statements. It is reasonably possible such changes in estimates and assumptions
could be significant.

**_Subsequent Events_**

We evaluated events subsequent to December 31, 2020 through March 25, 2021, the date the consolidated and
combined financial statements were available to be issued.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 201409, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which amends ASC 605 Revenue Recognition and creates
a new topic, ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 201409, ASC 606 was amended by various updates that amend and clarify the impact and implementation of the
aforementioned update. We adopted these updates on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition
method. The cumulative effect of applying the updates did not have a material impact on our consolidated and combined
financial statements.

The Company derives revenue from the sale of sanitizers and other treatment chemicals for pools, spas and other
industrial water applications. We recognize sales revenue at a point in time following the transfer of title of the product
to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts.
Sales are reported net of allowable discounts and estimated returns. Reserves for cash discounts, trade allowances and
sales returns are estimated using historical experience. We account for transportation activities related to contracts with
customers as costs to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated products. Accordingly, we record transportation costs
as a component of cost of goods sold. The Company excludes tax amounts assessed by governmental authorities that are
both (i) imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers from
our measurement of transaction prices. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of net sales or
cost of goods sold. We consider each transaction/shipment as a separate performance obligation. We recognize revenue
when the title transfers to the customer. As such, the remaining performance obligations at period end are not considered
significant.

The Company does not typically include extended payment terms or significant financing components in our contracts
with customers. Certain product sales contracts may include cash-based incentives (volume rebates or credits), which
are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected forecast quantities to be
provided to customers and reduce revenues recognized accordingly. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context
of the contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred
because the amortization period is one year or less.

See Note 4 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers for further information.


-----

**_Marketing and Distribution Expenses_**

Marketing and distribution expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss include selling,
distribution, marketing and advertising expenses; salaries, travel and office expenses of administrative associates and
contractors; and software license fees.

Marketing and distribution costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $58.0, $62.7 and $12.5 million in 2020, 2019
Successor and Predecessor periods, respectively.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses on the consolidated and
combined statements of comprehensive loss were $4.4, $4.3 and $0.9 million in 2020, 2019 Successor and Predecessor
periods, respectively.

**_Restructuring Activities_**

Restructuring charges, net include employee severance and benefit costs. We apply the provisions of ASC 420, Exit or
_Disposal Cost Obligations (ASC 420) or ASC 712, Compensation— Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, based on_
the facts and circumstances related to our restructuring activities. Severance costs accounted for under ASC 420 are
recognized when management with the proper level of authority has committed to a restructuring plan and communicated
those actions to employees. At each reporting date, we evaluate the accruals for restructuring costs to ensure the accruals
are still appropriate. Restructuring expenses were $2.3, $2.4 and $0.1 million in 2020, 2019 Successor and Predecessor
periods, respectively. The 2020 and 2019 period expenses were primarily attributed to the termination of certain
positions. The expense is included in Transaction and restructuring expenses on the consolidated and combined
statements of comprehensive loss. We had $2.3 million remaining liabilities as part of the restructuring activities as of
December 31, 2020 and no significant remaining liabilities as part of the restructuring activities as of December 31,
2019.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less when
purchased. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. We maintain amounts on deposit with various financial institutions, which may at times, exceed
federally insured limits. However, management periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of those institutions, and no
losses on such deposits have been recognized.

**_Accounts Receivable_**

We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts to reflect losses anticipated on accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based on historical write-offs,
an analysis of past due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and the economic status of customers,
if known. We believe that the allowance is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts; however, there can be no assurance
that unanticipated future business conditions of customers will not have a negative impact on our results of operations.
We generally do not require collateral for our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts. We writeoff uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for doubtful accounts after exhausting collection efforts.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories, which primarily include materials, direct labor, utilities and related manufacturing overhead, are stated at
the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average cost basis.


-----

**_Property, Plant, and Equipment and Depreciation_**

We record purchases of land, buildings, capitalized software, leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment at
cost. We report depreciation of property, plant and equipment in Cost of goods sold, Marketing and distribution expenses
and Administration and general expenses on the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss based on
the nature of the underlying assets. We record depreciation primarily related to the production of inventory within Cost
of goods sold. We record depreciation related to marketing, distribution and administrative functions within Marketing
and distribution expenses and Administration and general expenses.

Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives of plant and equipment. Machinery and
equipment is typically depreciated over two to sixteen years, and buildings are being depreciated up to thirty years. We
amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter.

We retain fully depreciated assets in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until we remove them from service.
In case of sale, retirement or disposal, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation balances are removed from
the respective accounts and the resulting net amount, after consideration of any proceeds, is included in Loss on sale of
property, plant and equipment on the consolidated and combined statements of cash flows and reported as Other
expenses, net on the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss. Maintenance and repairs of property
and equipment are expensed as incurred. We capitalize replacements and improvements that increase the estimated
useful life of an asset.

See Note 7—Property, Plant and Equipment for further information.

**_Leases_**

We lease certain of our vehicles, buildings, warehouses, factories, and office facilities under noncancelable operating
lease agreements. Certain of these operating lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses. We expense rent on a
straight-line basis over the life of our leases, which commences on the date we have the right to control leased property.

See Note 7—Property, Plant and Equipment for further information.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, unless changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have
occurred sooner. Our annual testing date for impairment is the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter.

We are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis. A reporting unit is the operating segment unless, for businesses
within that operating segment, discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management, in
which case such a component business is the reporting unit. We evaluated and concluded that each of the regional
components within our operating segment represent a single reporting unit. Goodwill impairment is present if a reporting
unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value. We primarily determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income
approach and supplement this with observable valuation multiples for comparable companies, as appropriate. The
income approach, which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis, calculates the fair value of a reporting unit by
estimating after-tax cash flows discounted using the Company’s consolidated weighted average cost of capital. The cash
flows used in the analysis are based on financial forecasts developed internally by management and require significant
judgment. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the reporting units are revenue
growth rate, cost of sales, and other operating expense growth rates. These assumptions are sensitive to future changes
in the business profitability, changes in our business strategy and external market conditions, among other factors.

As a result of our assessment, during 2019, we recorded a $106.6 million non-cash impairment charge to write off the
carrying value of our goodwill, which impairment is reflected in Goodwill impairment and related charges on the
consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss. This impairment charge does not impact our operations,
compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows.


-----

Definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and technology and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the respective intangible asset, ranging from six and a half to
fifteen and a half years. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of Administration and general expenses on
the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss.

If impairment indicators related to definite-lived intangible assets are present, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated over the remaining useful lives of the related asset group based on current projections. If the
projected net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset group, we then measure
impairment based on a discounted cash flow model and record an impairment charge as the excess of carrying value
over estimated fair value.

See Note 8—Goodwill and Intangibles Assets for further information.

**_Capitalization of Software Costs_**

We capitalize certain purchases of software and software development costs in connection with major projects of
software development for internal use. These expenditures totaled approximately $0.7 million in both 2020 and 2019
Successor period and are included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life not to exceed five years. Costs associated with business
process redesign, end-user training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred.

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Other Expense (Income), Net_**

Other non-operating (income) expenses, net on the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss
includes gains or losses on foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items. The functional currency for our
foreign operations is their local currency. Gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions consisted of income
of $0.2 million for 2020 and was expense of $1.1 million for the 2019 Successor period and was not significant for the
2019 Predecessor period.

The income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the
periods presented. The balance sheets of these entities are translated at period-end exchange rates. The gains or losses
resulting from foreign currency translation are included in Other comprehensive loss and are excluded from Net loss.

**_Defined-benefit Plans (pension plans)_**

Our net obligation in respect of defined-benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of
future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the
fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined-benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified external
actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset, the recognized asset is
limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any
applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the defined-benefit liability, which comprise actuarial
gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding
interest), are recognized immediately in Other comprehensive loss.

We determine the net interest expense on the net defined-benefit liabilities for the period by applying the discount rate
used to measure the defined-benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined-benefit liability,
taking into account any changes in the net defined-benefit liability during the period as a result of contributions and
benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined-benefit plans are recognized in the
consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

See Note 12—Employee Benefit Plans for further information.


-----

**_Fair Value Disclosures_**

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, and debt. The
net book values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and trade payables are representative of their respective
fair values due to their short-term nature. We estimate that the carrying value of all of our outstanding debt obligations
approximates fair value based on the variable nature of our effective interest rate associated with the indebtedness, which
is a Level 2 estimate based on a market approach.

**_Future Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements_**

_Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This new guidance establishes a right-of-use_
(“ROU”) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with
terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with such classification affecting
the pattern of expense recognition in the statements of comprehensive loss. Disclosure of key information about leasing
arrangements will also be required. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021
for private companies. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, Leases: Targeted Improvements, as an amendment
to ASU 2016-02, Leases, which provides entities with an additional transition method to recognize a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We will adopt the accounting standard
using a modified retrospective transition approach on January 1, 2022, which applies the provisions of the new guidance
at the effective date without adjusting the comparative periods presented, and will elect the package of practical
expedients, short-term practical expedient and the expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease
components. While the adoption of this new guidance will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, the
adoption will require us to record a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability upon adoption.

As of December 31, 2020, no other amendments to the ASC had been issued and not adopted by the Company that will
have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

**Note 2: Acquisition by Platinum Equity**

As described above, the Company was acquired by Platinum Equity pursuant to the Master Purchase Agreement entered
into on October 31, 2018, and effective February 28, 2019.

**_Acquisition Accounting_**

As a result of the Master Purchase Agreement, the fair value of the consideration transferred by Platinum Equity in
connection with the Transaction has been “pushed down” to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recorded at
fair value in accordance with ASC 805. The total consideration paid in connection with the Transaction consisted of cash
totaling approximately $622.9 million.


-----

The following table presents a summary of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of February 28,
2019 (in millions).

Tangible assets and liabilities:
Accounts receivable $ 156.3
Inventory 151.3
Property, plant and equipment 165.5
Other assets 13.7
Other liabilities assumed (105.5)

Identifiable intangible assets:
Customer relationships 68.0
Technology 45.0
Trademarks 22.0
Net identifiable assets acquired 516.3
Goodwill 106.6
Net assets acquired $ 622.9

The fair value assigned to goodwill at the time of the Transaction represented synergies expected to be realized after the
acquisition, as well as the assembled workforce. Of the fair value of net assets acquired, approximately $135.0 million
is comprised of identifiable intangible assets. Customer relationships are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of 15.5 years. Technology and trademarks are being amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of six and a
half years. The amortization expense associated with acquired definite-lived intangible assets is expected to approximate
$14.7 million during each of the next six years.

In connection with the Transaction described in Note 1 and above, the Master Purchase Agreement contained certain
provisions related to working capital and other matters. The Company and Lonza settled certain working capital
adjustments resulting in a liability totaling $7.2 million classified as Goodwill impairment and related charges on the
consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss for the 2019 Successor period.

**Note 3: Disposal of Business Unit**

On October 2, 2020, the Company completed the sale of the assets and liabilities related to our Surface Water operations
for aggregate consideration of $44.1 million. The pre-tax gain of $30.8 million is included in Other non-operating
(income) expense, net on the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss for 2020. The divestiture of
the Surface Water operations has not been classified as a discontinued operation because the disposition does not
represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial statements.


-----

**Note 4: Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

The majority of our annual revenues are recognized upon delivery and customer acceptance, paid for on account having
terms generally between 30 and 120 days, with most paying within 90 days. We believe that, based on experience with
similar transactions, the quality delivered will generally be accepted. Therefore, revenue is generally recognized when
title is transferred upon delivery of the products. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances, and rebates.

We derive revenue from the sale of sanitizers and other treatment chemicals for pools, spas and water parks (revenue
stream “Residential Water Products”). Furthermore, we generate revenue in the treatment of water for drinking,
agriculture, irrigation, food processing and industrial applications (revenue stream “Industrial, Commercial and
Municipal”). The types of customers we sell our products to are the basis to disaggregate revenue into categories that
depict how the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows are influenced by economic factors. The table below
illustrates the disaggregation of recognized revenues.

**_Successor_** **_Predecessor_**
**Year ended** **March 1 –** **January 1 –**
**December 31,** **December 31,** **February 28,**
**2020** **2019** **2019**

Residential Water Products $ 442,975 $ 364,215 $ 57,545
Industrial, Commercial and Municipal 144,374 132,729 21,958
Total net sales $ 587,349 $ 496,944 $ 79,503

**Note 5: Accounts Receivable**

**_Concentrations of Credit Risk_**

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are generally limited due to the
wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic
areas. One customer accounted for approximately 12%, 10% and 10% of total Net sales for the 2020, 2019 Predecessor
and Successor periods, respectively.

**Note 6: Inventories**

Inventories consisted of the following:

|Successor|Predecessor|
|---|---|
|March 1 – December 31, 2019|January 1 – February 28, 2019|
|$ 364,215 132,729|$ 57,545 21,958|
|$ 496,944|$ 79,503|


**December 31,** **December 31,**
**2020** **2019**

Raw materials and supplies $ 28,320 $ 28,304
Finished goods 58,352 76,525
86,672 104,829
Less: Reserves (5,407) (4,282)
Inventories, net $ 81,265 $ 100,547


-----

**Note 7: Property, Plant and Equipment**

Property, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following:

**December 31,** **December 31,**
**2020** **2019**

Land $ 3,319 $ 3,560
Buildings and leasehold improvements 49,225 45,833
Machinery and equipment 121,908 111,549
Construction in progress 9,200 15,907
183,652 176,849
Less accumulated depreciation (50,976) (17,561)
Property, plant and equipment, net $ 132,676 $ 159,288

Depreciation expense totaled $27.9, $17.6 and $2.8 million for 2020, 2019 Successor and Predecessor periods,
respectively.

**_Leases_**

We lease certain of our vehicles, buildings, warehouses, factories, and office facilities under non-cancelable operating
lease agreements. Certain of these operating lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses. We expense rent on a
straight-line basis over the life of our leases, which commences on the date we have the right to control leased property.
Minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases for years subsequent to December 31, 2020, are as follows:
2021—$13.4 million; 2022—$12.5 million; 2023—$12.4 million; 2024—$11.1 million; 2025 and after - $5.0 million.
Rent expense totaled $14.3, $12.4 and $2.3 million for 2020, and 2019 Successor and Predecessor periods, respectively.

**Note 8: Goodwill and Intangible Assets**

Subsequent to the Transaction completion and in connection with 2019 operating results, management revised our shortand long-term operating plans. These revised plans resulted in lower revenue growth and lower gross margins. The lower
revenue growth rate assumptions were primarily the result of sales underperformance resulting from decreases in
projected customer transaction volume. The lower gross margins were primarily due to less leverage of fixed costs as
well as higher projected input costs. Accordingly, in connection with our October 1 annual goodwill impairment testing
date, and during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as a result of our annual goodwill impairment test, we fully
impaired the goodwill associated with the Transaction totaling $106.6 million. The measurement of our goodwill
impairment was a Level 3 fair value measurement, and was based on a combination of the income approach and the
market approach.

Definite-lived intangible assets primarily include the trademarks, technology, and customer relationships. The
components of Intangible assets, net are as follows:

Amortization of intangible assets with definite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line
amortization, which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be
consumed or otherwise realized.

Amortization expense totaled $14.2, $12.2 and $0.9 million for 2020, 2019 Successor and Predecessor periods,
respectively. The amortization expense associated with acquired definite-lived intangible assets as of
December 31, 2020, is expected to approximate $14.1 million during each of the next five years.

**Note 9: Debt**

Our indebtedness and credit arrangements consisted of the following:

**December 31, 2020** **December 31, 2019**
Term loan $ 453,700 $ 457,300
Revolving credit facility       - 17,950

Less: current maturities of long-term debt (3,600) (21,553)
$ 419,899 $ 417,728

The debt discount is comprised of original issue discount of $14.4 million and deferred financing costs of approximately
$15.8 million. Approximately $5.8 million was amortized to interest expense in 2020, and $4.8 million was amortized
to interest expense in the 2019 Successor period.

Future maturities of our outstanding debt obligations are as follows for years ending December 31:

**Amount**
2021 $ 3,600

**2019 Credit Facilities**

On February 28, 2019, we entered into a $125 million asset-based revolving credit facility due February 28, 2024, a
$360 million first lien term loan credit facility due February 28, 2026, and a $100 million second lien term loan credit
facility due February 28, 2027 (the “2019 Credit Facilities” or “Term Loans”) with Bank of America, as Administrative
Agent and Collateral Agent. The revolving credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans.

The 2019 Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Company and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”).
Pursuant to the 2019 Credit Facilities, the Guarantors guarantee to the Lenders, among other things, all of the obligations
of the Company and each Guarantor under the 2019 Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Facilities are
secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each Guarantor’s owned real and personal property.

Interest rates are variable and are based on, at the option of the borrowers, LIBOR or base rate for United States dollar
loans, and CDOR or Canadian prime for Canadian dollar loans. In addition to paying interest on borrowings under the
2019 Credit Facilities, the borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver as well
an agency fee to Bank of America. Under the terms of the 2019 Credit Facilities, accrued interest on each loan is payable
in arrears on the applicable interest payment date for each loan. Principal repayments on the Term Loan are to be paid
quarterly beginning June 30, 2019 in such amounts as set forth in the 2019 Credit Facilities. The revolving credit facility
is subject to a borrowing base and is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution
payments, working capital and other corporate purposes. We will be required to make prepayments when and to the
extent the aggregate amount of outstanding loans and letters of credit under the asset-based revolving credit facility
exceeds the lesser of the aggregate amount of commitments in respect of the asset-based revolving credit facility or the
borrowing base.

The 2019 Credit Facilities contains customary covenants and default provisions and are subject to restrictions with
respect to indebtedness and guarantees, liens, consolidations and mergers, change of control, sales of certain assets, lines
of business and distributions. On any date when Global Availability, as defined, is less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of
the Line Cap, as defined, or (b) $7.5 million, the revolving credit facility also requires us to have a Consolidated Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio of at least 1 to 1. The default provisions under the 2019 Credit Facilities include, among other
things, defaults for nonpayment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, nonperformance of covenants,
cross-defaults and guarantor defaults. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2019 Credit Facilities could result
in all loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the revolving credit facility being
terminated. We are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2020.

The all-in interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2020, for the revolving credit facility, the first lien term loan, and
the second lien term loan were 3.8%, 6.0%, and 10.0%, respectively.

**_Interest Expense, Net_**

Interest expense, net, is composed primarily of interest expense on our variable rate debt instruments, partially offset by
interest income on cash and cash equivalents. We made interest payments of $35.0 and $32.4 million during 2020, and
2019 Successor period, respectively. No interest payments were made in the 2019 Predecessor period.

|---|---|
||January 1 – February 28, 2019|
||$ (5,780) (1,357)|
||$ (7,137)|


We account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This approach requires recognition of deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to
reverse, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and
the tax basis of an asset or liability. Management has established valuation allowances when it determines that it is
more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized based on available
evidence.

We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in multiple state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. With
respect to federal and state income tax, tax returns for all years are subject to future examination by local tax
authorities. With respect to material non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate, we have open tax years ranging from
2 to 15 years. The Company is under an indemnification agreement with the seller for open tax years preceding the
acquisition in 2019. We don't anticipate any material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits balance within the next
twelve months.

The provision for income taxes consisted of the following:

**_Successor_** **_Predecessor_**

As of December 31, 2020, we concluded that any temporary differences related to any excess in the amount of
financial reporting basis over the tax basis of our investment in our foreign subsidiaries are immaterial. Therefore, we
accrued no deferred tax liabilities related to temporary differences for our investment in foreign subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2020. We also considered the effects of a hypothetical distribution on a legal entity basis using a
bottoms-up approach, including the effect of any withholding taxes and determined the potential effects.
Consequently, we accrued foreign withholding taxes of approximately $0.2 million which would be payable upon
remittance of all previously unremitted earnings as of December 31, 2020.

Deferred tax assets were partially offset by valuation allowances of $51.0 million at both December 31, 2020 and
2019. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the value of our deferred tax assets also take into account
predictions of the amount and the categories of future taxable income, carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax
strategies which could impact the realization of a deferred tax asset. As of December 31, 2020, we could not sustain a
conclusion that it was more likely than not that we would realize most of our deferred tax assets resulting from recent
losses as well as other factors. Consequently, we maintain a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets. The


-----

majority of deferred tax assets which are not subject to a valuation allowance are located outside of the United States.
We have maintained a valuation allowance as a result of weighing all positive and negative evidence, including the
Company's history of losses in recent years and the difficulty of forecasting future taxable income. We intend to
maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal.

Our U.S. federal net operating losses will not expire by statute. Domestic state net operating loss carryforwards expire
between tax years 2024 and 2039. Unless utilized, certain non-U.S. net operating losses will expire in tax years 2029
through 2039, others may be carried forward indefinitely.

We believe that an ownership change, as defined under Internal Revenue Code section 382, did not occur during the
2019 tax year with respect to the U.S. entities. We have not analyzed the potential implications of an ownership
change related to our foreign entities. If certain substantial changes in the entity's ownership occur, there would be an
annual limitation on the amount of the carryforwards that can be utilized. As discussed above, we maintain a valuation
allowance against deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and credit carryforwards, which are not
considered more likely than not to be realized.

As of December 31, 2020, we had no gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties),
which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. There were no interest and penalties recognized in our
operating results. There are no significant increases in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticipated within the
next twelve months.

We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, in income tax
expense.

**_CARES Act_**

On March 27, 2020, the President of the Unites States signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security Act ("CARES Act"). There were several income tax provisions included in the CARES Act, as well as other
non-tax matters incorporated into law as a result of the enactment of the CARES Act.

Overall, the income tax provisions of the CARES Act are not expected to have a material impact on our financial
statements.

**_Consolidated Appropriations Act_**

On December 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021.
There were several income tax provisions included in this bill which include forgiveness of PPP loans, deferred
payroll taxes, extensions of certain tax provisions, employee retentions credits, and other provisions.

Overall, the income tax provisions of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 are not expected to have a material
impact on our financial statements.


-----

**Note 11: Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Litigation_**

We are subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Based on information currently available,
it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

We establish accruals for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably
estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for
such claims. In many cases, we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of actual costs or a range of reasonably possible
losses that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts accrued.

**_Environmental Matters_**

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation,
emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes
in all countries which we do business. We monitor the costs associated with these laws and regulations and do not have
a material liability related to environmental matters.

**Note 12: Employee Benefit Plans**

We maintain multiple non-qualified deferred compensation plans for the benefit of eligible employees. The plans are
specific to the respective country and provide for elective deferrals of an eligible employee’s compensation, which we
match with contributions as stipulated by each plan. Contributions by the Company totaled approximately $0.3 and
$0.1 million during 2020, and 2019 Successor period, respectively. The contributions were not significant during the
2019 Predecessor period.

We also operate certain defined-benefit plans in certain jurisdictions outside the United States. Of the approximately
453 employees covered by such plans, approximately 359 are based in Brazil. For pension accounting purposes, these
plans are considered as defined-benefit plans. The net accumulated benefit obligations were underfunded by
approximately $3.6 and $3.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The net periodic cost of the nonqualified plans was $0.5 and $0.4 million in 2020 and 2019 Successor period, respectively. The net periodic cost was
not significant during the 2019 Predecessor period.

**Note 13: Related Party Transactions**

During 2020, an amount of $23.9 million of our debt was purchased by a related party. Of our $453.7 million outstanding
long-term debt, a related party owns $23.9 million as of December 31, 2020. Interest expense paid to this related party
in 2020 was $1.1 million.

We paid Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC, (“Advisors”) an affiliate of Platinum Equity, approximately $5.0 million in
2020, and $4.2 million in the 2019 Successor period for ongoing management services, and such amounts are classified
as Administrative and general expenses in the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss.

On February 28, 2019, IWC, through its indirect majority parent, Platinum Equity, completed its acquisition of Water
Care from Lonza. As part of the Transaction, we entered into various Transition Service Agreements (collectively, the
“TSAs”) with Lonza to support normal business operations during the separation. The TSAs primarily relate to the daily
administrative functions of the business. Costs for the TSAs totaled $8.1 million in 2020, with the largest amounts being
$5.0 million for a transition coordination fee, $2.2 million for information technology, and $0.6 million for finance.
Costs for the TSAs totaled $10.2 million in the 2019 Successor period, with the largest amounts being $5.6 million for


-----

information technology, $1.8 million for finance, and $1.1 million for human resources. The TSAs were exited by
August 31, 2020.

These TSA costs are classified as follows in the consolidated and combined statements of comprehensive loss:

**_Successor_**

**Year ended** **March 1 –**
**December 31,** **December 31,**
**2020** **2019**

Cost of goods sold $        - $ 584
Marketing and distribution expenses        - 606
Research and development expenses       - 154
Administration and general expenses 8,120 8,897
$ 8,120 $ 10,241

For the two-month period ended February 28, 2019, Administrative and general expenses include certain costs charged
by Lonza in exchange for certain support functions including payroll, accounting services, customer services and
logistics services, information technology costs, and the allocation of general operating costs. Such costs incurred totaled
approximately $3.7 million for the two-month period ended February 28, 2019.

In the 2019 Predecessor period, a legal clearing account was used for transactions within Lonza for balancing entries for
cost allocations and transactions within a legal entity. Furthermore, the account was used for cash collections and cash
disbursement transactions. Due to the nature of the transactions in the clearing account between Water Care and its
related Lonza entities, the balance of the account is not zero for the Water Care business in the 2019 Predecessor period.
During the two-month period ended February 28, 2019, Lonza contributed approximately $55.7 million to the Water
Care business.

**Note 14: Equity-based Compensation**

In the 2019, IWC Holding Corporation, a subsidiary of Platinum Equity and our indirect parent company, adopted the
IWC Holding Corporation 2019 Participation Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of certain of our key employees.
Performance units granted under the Plan vest only upon a Qualifying Sale Event, as defined. Accordingly, no
performance units have vested, and no compensation expense has been recognized. Vesting will occur, and the
compensation expense will be recognized, when it is probable the performance condition will be met.

**Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Principles**

**_Organization and Description of the Business_**

Innovative Water Care Global Corporation (“IWC” or “we” or “our” or the “Company”), doing business as Sigura, is one
of the world’s leading suppliers of sanitizers and other treatment chemicals for pools, spas and industrial water
applications. We maintain six production facilities throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Africa and
sales locations in all major regions globally. We have three manufacturing facilities that primarily produce calcium
hypoclorite for water treatment and three packaging plants that produce finished products for sale to customers.

**_Basis of Presentation and Consolidation Policy_**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the
six months ended June 30, 2021 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2021.

**_Use of Estimates and Assumptions_**

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net
sales and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in these
estimates are recorded when known. Significant management judgment is required in determining the accounting for,
among other things, pension and postretirement benefits, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows
associated with impairment testing for tangible and intangible long-lived assets, goodwill, income taxes, contingencies,
inventory obsolescence and market reserves and the valuation of share-based compensation.

Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant public health concerns as well as
economic disruption, uncertainty, and volatility. If the pandemic persists or worsens, the Company’s operations could be
negatively affected, and there could be an adverse impact on the estimates and assumptions used to prepare our
consolidated financial statements. It is reasonably possible such changes in estimates and assumptions could be significant.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

The Company derives revenue from the sale of sanitizers and other treatment chemicals for pools, spas and other industrial
water applications. We recognize sales at a point in time following the transfer of title of the product to the customer,
which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. Sales are reported
net of allowable discounts and estimated returns. Reserves for cash discounts, trade allowances and sales returns are
estimated using historical experience. We account for transportation activities related to contracts with customers as costs
to fulfill our promise to transfer the associated products. Accordingly, we record transportation costs as a component of
cost of goods sold. The Company excludes tax amounts assessed by governmental authorities that are both (i) imposed on
and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and (ii) collected from customers from our measurement of
transaction prices. Accordingly, such tax amounts are not included as a component of net sales or cost of goods sold. We
consider each transaction/shipment as a separate performance obligation. We recognize revenue when the title transfers


-----

to the customer. As such, the remaining performance obligations at period end are not considered significant.

The Company does not typically include extended payment terms or significant financing components in its contracts with
customers. Certain product sales contracts may include cash-based incentives (volume rebates or credits), which are
accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected forecasted quantities to be
provided to customers and reduce sales recognized accordingly. Incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the
contract are recognized as expense in the period incurred. We generally expense sales commissions when incurred because
the amortization period is one year or less.

See Note 2 — Sales from Contracts with Customers for further information.

**_Marketing and Distribution Expenses_**

Marketing and distribution expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) include selling,
distribution, marketing and advertising expenses; salaries, travel and office expenses of sales associates and contractors;
and software license fees.

Marketing and distribution costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $23.9 and $27.1 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**_Research and Development Expenses_**

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses on the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income (loss) were $1.6 and $1.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively.

**_Restructuring Activities_**

Restructuring charges, net include employee severance and benefit costs. We apply the provisions of ASC 420, Exit or
_Disposal Cost Obligations (ASC 420) or ASC 712, Compensation— Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits, based on_
the facts and circumstances related to our restructuring activities. Severance costs accounted for under ASC 420 are
recognized when management with the proper level of authority has committed to a restructuring plan and communicated
those actions to employees. At each reporting date, we evaluate the accruals for restructuring costs to ensure the accruals
are still appropriate. We had $0 and $2.3 million accrued for restructuring activities as of June 30, 2021 and December
31, 2020, respectively. There were no significant restructuring expenses recorded during the six months ended June 30,
2021 and 2020.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents include investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less when
purchased. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair value due to the short-term nature of
these instruments. We maintain amounts on deposit with various financial institutions, which may at times, exceed
federally insured limits. However, management periodically evaluates the creditworthiness of those institutions, and no
losses on such deposits have been recognized.

**_Accounts Receivable_**

We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an allowance for estimated uncollectible
accounts to reflect losses anticipated on accounts receivable balances. The allowance is based on historical write-offs, an
analysis of past due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and the economic status of customers, if
known. We believe that the allowance is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts; however, there can be no assurance
that unanticipated future business conditions of customers will not have a negative impact on our results of operations.
We generally do not require collateral for our accounts receivable.

Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts. We write-off
uncollectible accounts receivable against the allowance for doubtful accounts after exhausting collection efforts.


-----

**_Inventories_**

Inventories, which primarily include materials, direct labor, utilities and related manufacturing overhead, are stated at the
lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average cost basis.

**_Property, Plant, and Equipment and Depreciation_**

We record purchases of land, buildings, capitalized software, leasehold improvements and machinery and equipment at
cost. We report depreciation of property, plant and equipment in Cost of goods sold, Marketing and distribution expenses
and Administration and general expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) based on the
nature of the underlying assets. We record depreciation primarily related to the production of inventory within Cost of
goods sold. We record depreciation related to marketing, distribution and administrative functions within Marketing and
distribution expenses and Administration and general expenses.

Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives of plant and equipment. Machinery and
equipment is typically depreciated over two to sixteen years, and buildings are being depreciated up to thirty years. We
amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or the useful life of the improvement, whichever is shorter.

We retain fully depreciated assets in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until we remove them from service.
In case of sale, retirement or disposal, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation balances are removed from the
respective accounts and the resulting net amount, after consideration of any proceeds, is included in Loss on sale of
property, plant and equipment on the consolidated statements of cash flows and reported as Other expenses, net on the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Maintenance and repairs of property and equipment are expensed
as incurred. We capitalize replacements and improvements that increase the estimated useful life of an asset.

**_Leases_**

We lease certain of our vehicles, buildings, warehouses, factories, and office facilities under noncancelable operating lease
agreements. Certain of these operating lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses. We expense rent on a straightline basis over the life of our leases, which commences on the date we have the right to control leased property.

**_Intangible Assets_**

Definite-lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships, trademarks, and technology and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the respective intangible asset, ranging from six and a half to fifteen
and a half years. Amortization expense is recorded as a component of Administration and general expenses on the
consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

If impairment indicators related to definite-lived intangible assets are present, we estimate the undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated over the remaining useful lives of the related asset group based on current projections. If the
projected net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the related asset group, we then measure
impairment based on a discounted cash flow model and record an impairment charge as the excess of carrying value over
estimated fair value.

See Note 5—Intangibles Assets for further information.

**_Capitalization of Software Costs_**

We capitalize certain purchases of software and software development costs in connection with major projects of software
development for internal use. These expenditures totaled $0.1 million and $0.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
2021 and 2020, respectively and are included in Other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and are
amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life not to exceed five years. Costs associated with
business process redesign, end-user training, system start-up and ongoing software maintenance are expensed as incurred.


-----

**_Foreign Currency Translation and Other Expense (Income), Net_**

Other non-operating (income) expense, net on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) includes gains
or losses on foreign currency transactions and other non-operating items. The functional currency for our foreign
operations is their local currency. Gains or losses relating to foreign currency transactions consisted of income of $0.3
million and $7.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The income statements of foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the
periods presented. The balance sheets of these entities are translated at period-end exchange rates. The gains or losses
resulting from foreign currency translation are included in Other comprehensive income (loss) and are excluded from Net
income (loss).

**_Defined-benefit Plans (pension plans)_**

Our net obligation in respect of defined-benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of
future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount and deducting the fair
value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined-benefit obligations is performed annually by a qualified external
actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculation results in a potential asset, the recognized asset is
limited to the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions
in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any
applicable minimum funding requirements. Remeasurements of the defined-benefit liability, which comprise actuarial
gains and losses and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding
interest), are recognized immediately in Other comprehensive income (loss).

We determine the net interest expense on the net defined-benefit liabilities for the period by applying the discount rate
used to measure the defined-benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined-benefit liability,
taking into account any changes in the net defined-benefit liability during the period as a result of contributions and benefit
payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined-benefit plans are recognized in the consolidated
statements of comprehensive income (loss).

**_Fair Value Disclosures_**

Our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, and debt. The
net book values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, and trade payables are representative of their respective
fair values due to their short-term nature. We estimate that the carrying value of all of our outstanding debt obligations
approximates fair value based on the variable nature of our effective interest rate associated with the indebtedness, which
is a Level 2 estimate based on a market approach.

**_Future Adoption of Accounting Pronouncements_**

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases. This new guidance establishes a right-of-use (“ROU”)
model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either financing or operating, with such classification affecting the pattern of
expense recognition in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Disclosure of key information about
leasing arrangements will also be required. This new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2021 for private companies. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, _Leases: Targeted Improvements, as an_
amendment to ASU 2016-02, _Leases, which provides entities with an additional transition method to recognize a_
cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We will adopt the
accounting standard using a modified retrospective transition approach on January 1, 2022, which applies the provisions
of the new guidance at the effective date without adjusting the comparative periods presented, and will elect the package
of practical expedients, short-term practical expedient and the expedient to not separate lease components from non-lease
components. While the adoption of this new guidance will not have a significant impact on our results of operations, the
adoption will require us to record a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability upon adoption.

As of June 30, 2021, no other amendments to the ASC had been issued and not adopted by the Company that will have or
are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

**Note 2: Sales from Contracts with Customers**

The majority of our sales are recognized upon delivery and customer acceptance, paid for on account having terms
generally between 30 and 120 days, with most paying within 90 days. We believe that, based on experience with similar
transactions, the quality delivered will generally be accepted. Therefore, revenue is generally recognized when title is
transferred upon delivery of the products. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns, trade allowances, and rebates.

We derive revenue from the sale of sanitizers and other treatment chemicals for pools, spas and water parks (revenue
stream “Residential Water Products”). Furthermore, we generate revenue in the treatment of water for drinking,
agriculture, irrigation, food processing and industrial applications (revenue stream “Industrial, Commercial and
Municipal”). The types of customers we sell our products to are the basis to disaggregate revenue into categories that
depict how the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows are influenced by economic factors. The table below
illustrates the disaggregation of recognized revenues.

**Six months** **Six months**
**ended June 30,** **ended June 30,**
**2021** **2020**

Residential Water Products $ 289,487 $ 245,694
Industrial, Commercial and Municipal 74,211 80,050
Total net sales $ 363,698 $ 325,744

**Note 3: Accounts Receivable**

**_Concentrations of Credit Risk_**

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are generally limited due to the
wide variety of customers and markets using our products, as well as their dispersion across many different geographic
areas. One customer accounted for approximately 12% and 16% of total net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2021
and 2020, respectively.

**Note 4: Inventories**

Inventories consisted of the following:


**June 30,** **December 31,**
**2021** **2020**

Raw materials and supplies $ 35,113 $ 28,320
Finished goods 65,773 58,352
100,886 86,672
Less: Reserves (6,105) (5,407)
Inventories, net $ 94,781 $ 81,265

**Note 5: Intangible Assets**

Definite-lived intangible assets primarily include the trademarks, technology, and customer relationships. The components
of Intangible assets, net are as follows:


-----

**June 30, 2021**
**Weighted**
**average** **Foreign**
**life** **Gross amount** **Accumulated** **currency** **Net carrying**
**(years)** **amortization** **translation** **amount**

Trademarks 6.5 $ 20,588 $ (7,387) $ 61 $ 13,262
Technology 6.5 42,111 (15,110) 125 27,126
Customer relationships 15.5 63,635 (9,575) 258 54,318
$ 126,334 $ (32,072) $ 444 $ 94,706

**December 31, 2020**
**Weighted**
**average** **Foreign**
**life** **Gross amount** **Accumulated** **currency** **Net carrying**
**(years)** **amortization** **translation** **amount**

Trademarks 6.5 $ 21,090 $ (5,771) $ (538) $ 14,781
Technology 6.5 43,140 (11,805) (1,101) 30,234
Customer relationships 15.5 65,188 (7,481) (1,599) 56,108
$ 129,418 $ (25,057) $ (3,238) $ 101,123

Amortization of intangible assets with definite lives is recognized over their estimated useful lives using straight-line
amortization, which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are expected to be
consumed or otherwise realized.

Amortization expense totaled $6.9 and $7.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The
amortization expense associated with acquired definite-lived intangible assets as of June 30, 2021, is expected to
approximate $14.1 million during each of the next five years.

**Note 6: Debt**

Our indebtedness and credit arrangements consisted of the following:

**June 30, 2021** **December 31, 2020**
Term loan $ 451,900 $ 453,700
Revolving credit facility 19,200       471,100 453,700
Less: debt discount (27,335) (30,201)
Less: current maturities of long-term debt (22,800) (3,600)
$ 420,965 $ 419,899

The debt discount is comprised of original issue discount of $14.4 million and deferred financing costs of approximately
$15.8 million. Approximately $2.9 million was amortized to interest expense in the six months ended June 30, 2021 and
2020.

Future maturities of our outstanding debt obligations are as follows for years subsequent to June 30, 2021:

**Amount**
2021 $ 1,800
2022 3,600
2023 3,600
2024 22,800
2025 3,600
Thereafter 435,700
$ 471,100


-----

**2019 Credit Facilities**

On February 28, 2019, we entered into a $125 million asset-based revolving credit facility due February 28, 2024, a $360
million first lien term loan credit facility due February 28, 2026, and a $100 million second lien term loan credit facility
due February 28, 2027 (the “2019 Credit Facilities” or “Term Loans”) with Bank of America, as Administrative Agent
and Collateral Agent. The revolving credit facility permits the issuance of letters of credit and swingline loans.

The 2019 Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Company and certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the “Guarantors”).
Pursuant to the 2019 Credit Facilities, the Guarantors guarantee to the Lenders, among other things, all of the obligations
of the Company and each Guarantor under the 2019 Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the 2019 Credit Facilities are
secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each Guarantor’s owned real and personal property.

Interest rates are variable and are based on, at the option of the borrowers, LIBOR or base rate for United States dollar
loans, and CDOR or Canadian prime for Canadian dollar loans. In addition to paying interest on borrowings under the
2019 Credit Facilities, the borrowers are required to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolver as well
an agency fee to Bank of America. Under the terms of the 2019 Credit Facilities, accrued interest on each loan is payable
in arrears on the applicable interest payment date for each loan. Principal repayments on the Term Loan are to be paid
quarterly beginning June 30, 2019 in such amounts as set forth in the 2019 Credit Facilities. The revolving credit facility
is subject to a borrowing base and is available to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, distribution
payments, working capital and other corporate purposes. We will be required to make prepayments when and to the extent
the aggregate amount of outstanding loans and letters of credit under the asset-based revolving credit facility exceeds the
lesser of the aggregate amount of commitments in respect of the asset-based revolving credit facility or the borrowing
base.

The 2019 Credit Facilities contains customary covenants and default provisions and are subject to restrictions with respect
to indebtedness and guarantees, liens, consolidations and mergers, change of control, sales of certain assets, lines of
business and distributions. On any date when Global Availability, as defined, is less than the greater of (a) 10.0% of the
Line Cap, as defined, or (b) $7.5 million, the revolving credit facility also requires us to have a Consolidated Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio of at least 1 to 1. The default provisions under the 2019 Credit Facilities include, among other things,
defaults for nonpayment, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, nonperformance of covenants, crossdefaults and guarantor defaults. The occurrence of an event of default under the 2019 Credit Facilities could result in all
loans and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and the revolving credit facility being terminated. We
are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of June 30, 2021.

The all-in interest rates in effect as of June 30, 2021, for the revolving credit facility, the first lien term loan, and the
second lien term loan were 3.8%, 6.0%, and 10.0%, respectively.

**_Interest Expense, Net_**

Interest expense, net, is composed primarily of interest expense on our variable rate debt instruments, partially offset by
interest income on cash and cash equivalents. We made interest payments of $18.2 and $16.3 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

**Note 7: Income Taxes**

Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory U.S. federal rate due to recurring items, such as state income taxes and
rate differences between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year but
are not consistent from year to year including valuation allowances.

As of December 31, 2020, we had no gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties),
which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. There were no interest and penalties recognized in our
operating results. There are no significant increases in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits anticipated within the
next twelve months.

We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if any, in income tax expense.


-----

**Note 8: Commitments and Contingencies**

**_Litigation_**

We are subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Based on information currently available,
it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected
future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

We establish accruals for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably
estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for
such claims. In many cases, we are unable to make a meaningful estimate of actual costs or a range of reasonably possible
losses that could possibly be higher or lower than the amounts accrued.

**_Environmental Matters_**

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations related to the use, storage, handling, generation, transportation,
emission, discharge, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes
in all countries which we do business. We monitor the costs associated with these laws and regulations and do not have a
material liability related to environmental matters.

**Note 10: Related Party Transactions**

During 2020, $23.9 million of our debt was purchased by a related party. Of our $451.9 million outstanding long-term
debt, a related party owns $23.9 million as of June 30, 2021. We paid $1.0 and $0.1 million of interest expense to this
related party during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

We paid Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC, (“Advisors”) an affiliate of Platinum Equity, approximately $2.5 million in the
six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 for ongoing management services, and such amounts are classified as
Administrative and general expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

**Note 11: Equity-based Compensation**

In the 2019, IWC Holding Corporation, a subsidiary of Platinum Equity and our indirect parent company, adopted the
IWC Holding Corporation 2019 Participation Plan (the “Plan”) for the benefit of certain of our key employees.
Performance units granted under the Plan vest only upon a Qualifying Sale Event, as defined. Accordingly, no performance
units have vested, and no compensation expense has been recognized. Vesting will occur, and the compensation expense
will be recognized, when it is probable the performance condition will be met.

**Note 12: Subsequent Events**

We evaluated events subsequent to June 30, 2021 through September 3, 2021, the date the unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements were available to be issued. On July 6, 2021, Platinum Equity entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire Solenis, a leading global producer of specialty chemicals used in water-intensive industries, from Clayton, Dubilier
& Rice and BASF. As part of this transaction, Solenis is expected to merge with IWC. The acquisition of Solenis and
merger with IWC are expected to be completed before the end of 2021, subject to regulatory approval and customary
closing conditions.
