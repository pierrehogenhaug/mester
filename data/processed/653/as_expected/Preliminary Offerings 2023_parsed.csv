653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,26,NOTICE TO INVESTORS,26.1,,26.1.1,,"We are making this offering in reliance on an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for offers and sales of securities that do not involve a public offering. The Notes may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws. Laws in certain jurisdictions may restrict the distribution of this offering memorandum and the offer and sale of the Notes. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Notes are delivered must inform themselves about, and observe, those restrictions. You must comply with all applicable laws and regulations in force in any applicable jurisdiction, and you must obtain any consent, approval or permission required for the purchase, offer or sale by you of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force in the jurisdiction to which you are subject or in which you make such purchase, offer or sale, and neither we nor the initial purchasers will have any responsibility therefor. By purchasing the Notes, you will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations, warranties and agreements as set forth under “Transfer Restrictions” in this offering memorandum. We are not, and the initial purchasers are not, making an offer to sell the Notes in any jurisdiction except where an offer or sale is permitted. You should understand that you will be required to bear the financial risks of your investment for an indefinite period of time. This offering memorandum summarizes documents and other information in a manner we believe to be accurate, but we refer you to the actual documents for a more complete understanding of the information we discuss in this offering memorandum. In making an investment decision, you must rely on your own examination of such documents, our business and the terms of the offering and the Notes, including the merits and risks involved. The initial purchasers make no representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the information set forth in this offering memorandum, and nothing contained in this offering memorandum is, nor should you rely upon it as, a promise or representation, whether as to the past or the future. The initial purchasers are acting exclusively for the Issuer and no one else in connection with the offering contemplated by this offering memorandum. They will not regard any other person (whether or not a recipient of this offering memorandum) as their client in relation to the offering of securities contemplated by this offering memorandum and will not be responsible to anyone for providing the protections afforded to a client nor for giving advice in relation to the offering or any transaction or arrangement referred to herein. This offering memorandum is being provided on a confidential basis (1) to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act for informational use solely in connection with their consideration of the purchase of the Notes and (2) in offshore transactions outside the United States complying with Rule 903 or Rule 904 of Regulation S under the Securities Act. Its use for any other purpose is not authorized. This offering memorandum may not be copied or reproduced in whole or in part, and it may only be distributed and disclosed to the prospective investors to whom it is provided by us or by the initial purchasers. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 (as amended, the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the “Prospectus Regulation”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation. ii ----- Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each initial purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to MiFID II, the target market assessment in respect of the Notes described in this offering memorandum has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for such Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of such Notes to such persons are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending such Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended, the “EUWA”), and as amended; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the UK Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as amended (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (“UK MiFIR”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful. This offering memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in the United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA and as amended (the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) and the FSMA from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Notes. This offering memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation. Solely for the purposes of the product approval process of each initial purchaser that considers itself a manufacturer pursuant to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”), the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook, and professional clients, as defined in UK MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The above selling restrictions are in addition to any other selling restrictions set out in this offering memorandum. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that (1) you have been afforded an opportunity to request and to review all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy of, or to supplement, the information contained in this offering memorandum, (2) you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in connection with the investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision, (3) this offering memorandum relates to an offering that is exempt from registration under the Securities Act, and (4) no person has been authorized to give information or to make any representations concerning us, this offering or the Notes described in this offering memorandum, other than as contained in this offering memorandum, and in information given by our duly authorized officers and employees in connection with an investor’s examination of us and the terms of the offering of the Notes. We and the initial purchasers make no representation to you that the Notes are a legal investment for you. You should not consider any information included in this offering memorandum to be legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own attorney, business advisor and tax advisor for legal, business and tax advice regarding an investment in the Notes. Neither the delivery of this offering memorandum nor any sale made pursuant to this offering memorandum implies that any information set forth in this offering memorandum is correct as of any date after the date of this offering memorandum. iii ----- You should contact the initial purchasers with any questions about this offering or if you require additional information to verify the information contained in this offering memorandum. We reserve the right to withdraw this offering of the Notes at any time. We and the initial purchasers also reserve the right to reject any offer to purchase the Notes in whole or in part for any reason, to sell less than the entire principal amount of the Notes offered in this offering memorandum and to allot to any prospective investor less than the full amount of Notes sought by such investor. We are making this offering of the Notes subject to the terms described in this offering memorandum and the Indenture, as applicable. Each series of Notes will be available in book-entry form only. We expect that each series of Notes sold pursuant to this offering memorandum will be issued in the form of one or more global certificates. The global certificates will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of, with respect to the Euro Notes, Euroclear and Clearstream and, with respect to the Dollar Notes, DTC. Beneficial interests in the global certificates will be shown on, and transfers of the global certificates will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and its direct and indirect participants. After the initial issuance of the global certificates, Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global certificates only as set forth in the Indenture. See “Book-Entry, Delivery and Form.” We do not intend to apply for listing of the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes in any automated dealer quotation system. We intend to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange after the issue date of the Euro Notes. There can be no assurance that the application to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange will be approved and settlement of the Euro Notes is not conditioned on the Issuer making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. Neither the admission of the Euro Notes to be listed on the Exchange, nor the approval of this offering memorandum pursuant to the listing requirements of the Authority shall constitute a warranty or representation by the Authority as to the competence of the service providers to, or any other party connected with, the Issuer, the adequacy of information contained in this offering memorandum or the suitability of the Issuer for investment or any other purposes. In connection with this offering, the initial purchasers may, but are not required to, effect transactions that stabilize or maintain the market price of each series of Notes at a higher level than such series of Notes might otherwise achieve in the open market. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. For a description of these activities, see the section entitled “Plan of Distribution” in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is strictly confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the proposed offering of the Notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is personal to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or the public generally to subscribe for or otherwise acquire the Notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the offeree and those persons, if any, retained to advise such offeree with respect to this offering memorandum is unauthorized and any disclosure of any of its contents without our prior written consent is prohibited. By accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, you agree to the foregoing and not to make any photocopies, in whole or in part, of this offering memorandum or any documents delivered in connection with this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum, as well as any other documents related to this offering, will not be reviewed or approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Notes and related guarantees described in this offering memorandum have not been registered with, recommended by or approved by the SEC or any other federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority, nor has the SEC or any such federal, state or foreign securities commission or regulatory authority passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this offering memorandum. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. There are no registration rights associated with the Notes, and we have no intention to offer Notes registered under the Securities Act in exchange for the Notes offered in this offering or to file a registration statement with respect to the Notes. The Indenture will not be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). iv -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

They appear in a number of places throughout this offering memorandum and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the industry in which we operate. Statements contained in this offering memorandum that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements and may include, but are not limited to, management’s expectations of competition; market share; revenues, margin, expenses and other operating results and ratios; economic conditions; vendor terms and conditions; pricing strategies; customer terms and conditions; organizational changes and related restructuring, integration and other reorganization costs; additional cost reduction measures and related restructuring costs; process and efficiency enhancements; our ability to take advantage of market trends; our international expansion; macroeconomic conditions; cost-savings; cash flows; working capital levels and days; capital expenditures; liquidity; capital requirements; effective tax rates; acquisitions and integration costs and the benefits to our business; operating models; exchange rate fluctuations and related currency gains or losses; resolution of contingencies; our competitive advantages; seasonality; interest rates and expenses; and rates of return, as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategy. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. We believe that these risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this offering memorandum. Those factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read with the other cautionary statements in this offering memorandum. Among the risks and uncertainties that may significantly impact us are, without limitation, risks associated with: - failure to develop and market new products and optimally manage product life cycles; - failure to appropriately manage process safety and product stewardship issues; - changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations or political conditions in the countries in which we operate; - conditions in the global economy and global capital markets, including economic factors, such as inflation, deflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as regulatory requirements; - protectionist measures, including tariffs and other barriers to trade; - fluctuations in our industry that could adversely affect our end market customers; - impact of business disruptions, including supply chain disruptions, and security threats, regardless of cause, including acts of sabotage, cyber-attacks, terrorism or war, weather events and natural disasters; - inability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights; - successful integration of acquired businesses; - liquidity of Ashland (as defined herein) from which we have significant indemnification assets; - fluctuations in interest (SOFR, LIBOR, EURIBOR or other applicable reference rates) rates which may affect service costs on our external debt; v ----- - acquisitions and divestitures of our competitors; - our ability to successfully consummate the Acquisition; - the incurrence of substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Transactions; - a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable diseases, or other public health crisis; - the impact of sanctions or other actions taken by the United States or other countries, and retaliatory measures taken by Russia in response, or, in connection with, the war in Ukraine; - systemic bank failures and the impact on markets, liquidity and economic conditions; - energy and raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as related costs; - the competition our products and services face and our ability to adapt to industry and market changes; - the consolidation of customers; - current and potential litigation involving us; - malfunction or intentional hacking of our technological systems; - compliance with privacy laws and adequate protection of personal data; - our ability to retain and attract qualified employees and key personnel; - our financing efforts; - our ownership structure, including Parent not controlling the acquired business until completion of the Acquisition; - the successful, long-term implementation of optimizations from the Legacy Acquisitions (as defined herein) and the Acquisition and the continued effect of the Legacy Acquisitions and the pendency of the Acquisition, including on our ability to retain key personnel and on our business relationships, operating results and business generally; and - the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted related to the Acquisition. Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those described in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, growth, strategies, position in the market and the development of the industry in which we operate are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this offering memorandum, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make in this offering memorandum speak only as of the date of those statements, and we undertake no obligation to update those statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. vi -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1055,USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,1055.1,,1055.1.1,,"To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance an understanding of past performance: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows. We believe that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors. We utilize Segment profit as the primary measure of our segment specific performance. The following terms have the following meanings: - “Adjusted EBITDA” means EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to (i) for Solenis, the impact of non-recurring charges, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments related to the Legacy Acquisitions and the Sigura Contribution, non-service costs for pensions and other non-operational items, one-time consulting and transaction costs related to the Acquisition, management fees paid to Sponsor, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, as well as other non-recurring and unusual costs and, (ii) for Diversey, the impact of non-recurring charges, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, nonservice costs for pensions and other non-operational items, one-time consulting and transaction costs related to the Acquisition, realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains/losses, tax adjustments not related to income tax, factoring and securitization fees, COVID-19 inventory charges, as well as other non-recurring and unusual costs. - “Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega)” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to, with respect to Solenis the impact of incentive compensation at 1.0x of the applicable targets, the pre-close EBITDA of Clearon and the unaudited pro forma impact for certain estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions (i) that were taken within 18 months of the closing of the Solenis Acquisition and (ii) that were taken or are expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Clearon Acquisition and, with respect to Diversey, expected savings from Project Mega. - “Adjusted net operating cash flows” and “Adjusted net investing cash flows” means, for Solenis, reported net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities, each adjusted for the effects of cash subsequently received as part of our Accounts Receivable Facility (as defined herein). - “EBITDA” means net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (including amortization of pre-publication investment cash costs). - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA” means Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and _Project Mega)” means Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and_ Project Mega) further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. - “Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies)” means Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the unaudited pro forma combined impact for certain estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted vii ----- EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies).” - “Pro Forma Combined EBITDA” means EBITDA further adjusted to give effect to the Transactions. - “Segment profit” means, for Solenis, EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, non-recurring or other items that are included in net (loss) and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and (iii) certain unusual or non-recurring items impacting results in a particular period. We believe the EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows may vary from that of other competitors in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to income before income taxes, net (loss), or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance and liquidity. See “Summary—Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Parent—Non-GAAP Financial Metrics—Reconciliation of Net income (loss) to EBITDA and Segment Profit.” With respect to Adjusted net operating cash flows and Adjusted net investing cash flows, Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-15 requires us to evaluate the transfer of title of receivables sold under our Accounts Receivable Facility against cash received on previously-sold receivables in exchange for the transfer of title. Since there is a dichotomy between when we legally transfer title of receivables to ING Luxembourg S.A. or, in prior periods, MUFG Bank, Ltd. under the receivables purchasing agreements and when the cash is received on previously-sold receivables, receivables are deemed transferred in exchange for a beneficial interest in the collection of that receivable. This is considered a non-cash investing activity. Furthermore, ultimate receipts of cash, when settled with ING Luxembourg S.A. or, in prior periods, MUFG Bank, Ltd., are considered cash flows from investing activities, as the receipt is considered a return of capital on the beneficial interest. We believe that this may cause net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) investing activities to be potentially misleading to investors. While we do not retain legal ownership of the receivables sold, the nature, timing, and extent of cash flows have not materially changed as a result of the agreement. We use these non-GAAP metrics to assess our own liquidity. We believe these non-GAAP metrics supplement the user’s evaluation of our cash flows and liquidity. The adjustments reflected in our Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) have not been prepared with a view towards complying with Article 11 of Regulation S-X. Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) are intended to provide additional information on a more comparable basis than would be if provided without such adjustments because they account for initiatives related to back office, sales and support staff optimization, warehouse and temporary labor efficiency and technology, among others. The non-GAAP measures noted above are the primary indicators that we use internally to conduct and measure our business and evaluate the performance of our consolidated operations. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they provide meaningful comparisons to prior periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with viii ----- GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. A material limitation associated with these non-GAAP measures as compared to the GAAP measures is that they may not be comparable to other companies with similarly titled measures that present related measures differently. The non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Indenture governing the Notes, the Existing Indentures and the Credit Agreements include definitions of EBITDA-based metrics that are different from the definition of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) used herein. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The non-GAAP metrics do not necessarily indicate whether cash flow will be sufficient or available to meet our cash requirements and may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor are such measures meant to be predictive of our future results. Our non-GAAP metrics have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debts; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; - some of the exceptional items that we eliminate in calculating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted ix ----- EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) reflect cash payments that were made, or will be made in the future; and - other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, or Adjusted net investing cash flows differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), Segment profit, Adjusted net operating cash flows, and Adjusted net investing cash flows along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance and liquidity. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, and net (loss) amongst other performance metrics. In evaluating these financial measures, one should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of such measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. We may incur expenses similar to the adjustments noted herein to calculate Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies). However, the magnitude of such adjustments for the periods noted below is not necessarily indicative of the magnitude of such adjustments in future periods. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data” for a reconciliation of these measures to our directly comparable GAAP measures. Because the leverage ratios presented in this offering memorandum are based, in part, on Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies), these measures are similarly impacted by the limitations referenced above and also should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. x -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Parent was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the “Successor” entity for the specific purpose of having consummated the Solenis Acquisition. Parent also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of having received the contribution of the Sigura business, which was acquired by Platinum on February 28, 2019 and was contributed to Parent (the “Sigura Contribution”) immediately following the Solenis Acquisition on November 9, 2021. Parent was formed under a group of holding companies. These holding companies and partnerships are collectively referred to as the “Holding Companies.” The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash, cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above. Upon the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition, Platinum acquired all of the capital stock and equity interests of the entities comprising the legacy Solenis operations from Solenis UK Holdings Limited. Immediately following the Solenis Acquisition, the Sigura Contribution was effected, which included all of Sigura’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, and which contributed the Sigura business to the Issuer from affiliates of Platinum.

Prior to the formation of Parent and the occurrence of the Solenis Acquisition, the Solenis business existed under the “Predecessor” entity known as Solenis UK International.

Instead, the Solenis Acquisition was structured to acquire all of the entities that were direct or indirect subsidiaries of Solenis UK International.

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Company Overview,9.1.4,Combined Company,"We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will create a platform with a shared commercial focus and significant global scale in complementary end markets. After giving effect to the Transactions, the combined company will be able to grow and provide a number of attractive cross-selling opportunities, including meeting customers’ increasing demand for “one-stop shop” service models across water management, cleaning and hygiene solutions. After giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to be better positioned to benefit from growing Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and macroeconomic trends, including those around customer sustainability goals and focus points, such as: heightened focus on water consumption and recycling; the need for improved energy efficiency and raw material management; increased consumer focus on hygiene; increased environmental legislation being implemented globally; and increased levels of shipping and packaging. Together, we will offer a diverse, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, which will limit any obsolescence risk as no product or solution represents a material part of our business. 2 ----- Solenis’ and Diversey’s combined segment, geographic and end market breakdown by revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 is illustrated below.[(1) ] (1) Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding. Our leading technology has been at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry and we have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products that we expect will drive significant value for our customers. The combination of Solenis and Diversey represents the coming together of two leading global products, services, and technologies providers with proven track records of product innovation who offer truly differentiated solutions to customers. Prior to the Transactions, we already operate across a diverse set of growing end markets and our broad geographic reach allows us to meet the needs of our customers globally. After giving effect to the Transactions, our combined footprint will continue to span six continents, with reinforced strength and scale of presence, with an increased number of laboratories and production facilities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve all major developed markets and are closely integrated with our customers throughout the world. After giving effect to the Transactions, through our global presence and differentiated service offering in growing markets, we believe we will be a leading provider in all of our segments and will continue to benefit from positive secular trends such as e-commerce for customers, an increased demand for sustainable packaging, a focus on ESG and incremental disposable income increases in emerging markets. The following graphic summarizes the geographic reach of 3 ----- laboratories and production facilities of the combined Solenis company following the Transactions. After giving effect to the Transactions, we will operate 70 manufacturing facilities and 18 laboratories in 23 countries. (1) Includes research, customer application, and development sites. (2) Pro forma for Project Mega facility and associated plant consolidations. See “—Growth Strategy.” There is limited existing overlap between Solenis’ and Diversey’s offerings in water treatment chemicals with legacy Solenis operating in the water treatment and pool solutions markets and legacy Diversey operating in the food and beverage and institutional end markets. We believe the combined company platform will be able to “circle the customer” and create opportunities for new business wins, increasing our customer spending. For example in hotels today, Solenis has a limited presence in pool solutions while Diversey provides kitchen care, building care, floor care, infection prevention and laundry care. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe the fact that Solenis and Diversey provide different services to their combined customers will provide the combined company with the opportunity to offer existing hotel customers our full suite of products and services, including water treatment. Similarly, Solenis does not currently serve cruise ships or hospitals but will have the opportunity to offer its services to Diversey’s customers in these markets. Protein processing plants are another customer type that each of Solenis and Diversey have a moderate presence with, and going forward, a combined company platform may enable both companies to expand their offerings with such customers. We believe the Transactions present the opportunity to combine our existing services into a “one-stop shop” provider across water management, cleaning and hygiene solutions for our customers. The following graphic summarizes the potential cross-selling opportunities for the combined company. 4 ----- After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be able to implement near-term strategic initiatives in the legacy Diversey to better optimize processes, drive growth and create value. Some key initiatives will include (i) increasing scale by bundling our leading global cleaning and water treatment solutions across Industrial and Food & Beverage to increase win rates and cross-selling opportunities, (ii) increasing efficiencies by standardizing corporate functions, (iii) implementing a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, (iv) investing in growth opportunities such as expansion efforts within: North America commercial and institutional, high growth global strategic accounts (“GSAs”), distributor partnerships and building out new product introduction (NPI) capabilities and (v) applying our performance management capabilities to existing processes. We believe by creating real-time visibility into financial performance we will be able to drive accountability at a more localized level and assist in informing business decisions (such as pricing and have better insight into profitability and distributors’ sell-through). We believe we will be able to further supplement our efforts by deploying commercial excellence tools such as roll-outs and trainings. Additionally, we believe we can continue implementing Diversey’s “Project Mega” by continuing to develop Diversey’s manufacturing and warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky alongside consolidating certain existing service centers to provide manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities. We believe our business exhibits highly attractive financial characteristics, including significant recurring revenues, improving margin profile and substantial free cash flow conversion. The combined company will provide greater scale, a broader global reach, superior customer service capabilities and a number of attractive cross-selling opportunities. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we generated pro forma Net sales on a combined historical basis and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) of $7.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, inclusive of $205 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions expected to be taken within 24 months after the Acquisition and $40 million of cumulative run-rate annual cost synergies from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and $13 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24 months of the Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. We believe our combined earnings profile after giving effect to the Transactions will generate significant free cash flow, which we expect will be used to support growth initiatives and drive de-leveraging. We believe that the Transactions create an opportunity to realize meaningful synergies resulting from the integration of Solenis and Diversey. In combining these two complementary businesses, we believe the combined company is entering a new and exciting chapter in a long history of helping customers address core challenges such as water and energy management, partnering on sustainability issues to work towards a cleaner, safer world, and reducing environmental impacts. We expect to realize approximately $205 million of synergies from integration related to the consolidation of support functions and sales teams, the consolidation of sourcing of direct materials, and the consolidation of facilities between the two businesses, as a result of actions expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such synergies. For more information on anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may impact our ability to achieve such synergies or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies).” The prospective unaudited financial information contained in this offering memorandum was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information.

The water treatment process begins with testing; specifically pool pH and chlorine levels on a weekly basis. The next step is balancing, i.e., maintaining certain levels of pH, total alkalinity and calcium hardness. Sanitizing, which is keeping water clean and disinfected, is most frequently done using stabilized chlorine products. Specialty maintenance products such as algaecides and clarifiers are typically used on a semimonthly basis, in addition to the normal sanitizing process, to target specific pool needs such as algae prevention or stain control. Lastly, shock treatment can be used to address one-off pool care needs, especially following inclement weather and high pool usage. We are a leading producer of pool chemicals for the residential and commercial markets worldwide and provide various water treatment products including shock, sanitizer, specialty maintenance products, and test strips. Our offerings include a full suite of products and applications aimed at public pools, health clubs, aquatic parks, hotels, motels, apartments and condominiums in the form of water-soluble pods, convenient floaters and automatic feeders.

We will be one of the major global players within the segment, therefore, we believe we will have the product breadth, scale, supply chain flexibility and service capabilities to compete with Ecolab. Further, we believe there is an opportunity to capture customers within underserved sectors such as cruise ships, logistics, warehousing, casinos, and theme parks. 11 ----- We believe that our Institutional Solutions segment’s revenue base will be recurring and stable due to the ‘sticky’ nature of our business model. Our cleaning products will be consumable in nature and require periodic replacement, generating highly recurring revenue. Additionally, the optimal application of our chemicals will be controlled by our proprietary dosing and dispensing equipment installed at customer sites, which will increase customer switching costs and generate operating efficiencies for our customers. Based on a third-party report completed in February 2023, manufacturing and commercial and healthcare and hospitality end markets are growing at a CAGR of 5.1% and 5.5%, respectively for the four year period 2022 to 2026.

Our customer base for the combined company includes many of the top paper and industrial players across our Industrial Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments, including WestRock, International Paper, and Marathon Petroleum, across big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Leslie’s Poolmart in our Pool Solutions segment, across Compass, ISS and McDonald’s in our Institutional Solutions segment and across PepsiCo and Nestle in our Food & Beverage segment. We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will further reduce customer concentration. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the top ten customers for the combined company represent approximately 12% of total pro forma combined company Net sales with the largest customer representing approximately 2% of pro forma combined company Net sales. As of March 31, 2023, at Solenis, the top ten customers represented approximately 19% of total Net sales with the top three customers representing approximately 11%. Historically, large accounts have grown 1.3x faster than the base business, driven by collaboration with customers on new technology development, embedded service engineers and focus on consistent delivery and service. As of March 31, 2023 at Diversey, customer concentration was relatively in line with that of Solenis so low customer concentration is set to become even less concentrated as a result of the combination of Solenis and Diversey. Further, Diversey is a major global player with capabilities to serve GSAs, which represents approximately 20% of revenue. Both Solenis and Diversey have long-tenured, diverse and high quality customer relationships. We believe our customer base is inherently sticky, attributable to the mission critical nature and service-led models that Solenis and Diversey provide, leading to highly recurring, non-discretionary spend on products and services. On-site technicians, employees and equipment at customer locations create high switching costs and disruption risk. As a result, we believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately 97% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and value proposition and will continue to remain over 97% recurring in the combined company. _Suppliers & Procurement_ We source materials from multiple suppliers creating low supply chain concentration. On April 30, 2021, Solenis and BASF agreed to extend the supply agreements applicable to certain products that are critical to Solenis’ supply chain and for which Solenis takes all of BASF’s production, which now will not expire until November 2028. Our largest raw material spend includes General Liquids (5.4% of total spend), Caustic and Chlorine (3.3% of total spend), Acrylonitrile (2.9% of total spend), HDPE (2.2% of total spend) and Sodium Hydroxide (2.1% of total spend) resulting in a top five materials of 15.9% or $590 million.

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Industry Overview,9.18.1,Specialty Chemicals – Consumer,"The Consumer market is comprised of water treatment chemicals and solutions for pulp and paper specific process applications (e.g., strength additives and sizing agents across wet-end/dry-end of paper process). Based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, the global Consumer market was estimated to be approximately $8 billion in 2020. The Packaging market is one of the key market segments within the Consumer market that can be broken into consumer packaging and food packaging. Based on the same report, the Consumer packaging market was estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 3.4% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030, which we believe will be driven primarily from the growth of e-commerce and megatrends in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and beauty. Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the consumer packaging market. Based on the same report, the food packaging market was estimated to be $1.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030 (including food packaging barrier film expected to grow at a 4.7% CAGR), driven by increased demand for ecofriendly packaging and changing lifestyles centering on more take-away and individually packed food. We believe the shift away from plastic and the growth in the barrier coating market, which is not included in the market size estimate, may drive additional growth in food packaging over this period. Approximately 7% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the food packaging and molded fiber packaging market. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market has been adversely impacted by the continued substitution of printed material with electronic media. Reduced use of commercial office spaces in Europe and North America as a result of COVID-19 is also a negative factor for the sector outlook. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to decline at a 0.9% CAGR for the ten-year period from 2020 to 2030. However, we have limited exposure to newsprint, which accounts for approximately 2.5% of Consumer Solutions sales, and we are shifting our focus to higher margin products to offset the expected volume decline in this market. Approximately 5% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the Graphic & Specialty Paper market. The Tissue & Towel market is benefiting from strong demographic/socioeconomic trends and increasing hygiene standards, especially in developing markets. However, stagnating population growth in some mature markets, and cost-cutting in the public sector and private company spending is expected to limit global market growth. The Tissue & Towel market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 2.6% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030. Approximately 6% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the Tissue & Towel market. 16 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Broadly speaking, the industrial market consists of core water treatment which includes end markets such as pulp, mining and oil and gas, and wastewater, which includes end markets such as municipal and industrial wastewater markets. Based on the same report, the global industrial market was estimated to be approximately $23 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025 for both the wastewater and core water treatment markets. The municipal market is expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report, as demand continues to increase from higher per capita usage of water, population growth and increasing regulatory demands. Growth in the core water treatment market, including both heavy and light industrial markets, is expected to be driven by increasing sustainability and environmental policies, growing regulatory demands and global industrial growth. This growth is expected to be highest in the food and beverage market (5.5% CAGR for the five year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report) and the refining and petrochemicals market (4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report).

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Industry Overview,9.18.3,Pool,"The aftermarket for the residential pool industry is comprised of three main segments: (1) Chemicals, (2) Equipment, Parts, and Accessories and (3) Services. Our main focus is on the Chemicals segment which is the largest and most stable component of aftermarket pool spend. Pool chemicals sales are tied to: (1) the pool installed base and (2) total gallons of treatable water, and not new builds. The U.S. pool installed base has displayed long-term stability as it has consistently grown for decades, including all years through the housing-led recession and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is providing current tailwinds for the business. As of December 31, 2022, the installed base of U.S. in ground pools was 9 million, based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. However, new builds account for less than 4% of the installed base annually, meaning that new build rates are unlikely to materially impact our long-term performance. The Pool Solutions segment also benefits from a stable aftermarket spend that mirrors the steady dynamic of the installed base. Our chemical-based products result in 100% aftermarket exposure, which reduces our exposure to cyclical industry trends such as housing starts. Pool chemical use is entirely non-discretionary in that it is a requirement for owning and using a pool. Pool owners who have already made the significant upfront investment of constructing a pool, estimated to cost $40,000 to $100,000, will continue to purchase pool chemicals, at the de minimis annual expense of $300 to $400 in order to maintain their pools. The pool chemical treatment market includes products such as primary sanitizers (71% of total market sales), specialty chemicals, other shocks and alternative sanitizers. Primary sanitizers include cal-hypo, sodium hypochlorite (“sodium-hypo”), trichlor, dichlor and packaged shocks. The total market for U.S. residential pool chemicals, based on retail dollar value, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2020 and grew by 28% in 2021 to approximately $3.4 billion, primarily due to higher prices resulting from scarcity of chlorine based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We believe the U.S. residential pool chemical market, on a volume basis, will exceed the expected growth of the installed base of U.S. residential pools, which was estimated to be 3.0% from 2020 to 2025 based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We further believe that volumes in our pool solutions segment will exceed the market as we expand our customer base and increase market sale with new dealer relationships and e-commerce.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.20,Global Food & Beverage Market Size (2022 – 2026) [(2) ],9.20.2,Competitive Landscape,"_Consumer Solutions_ We believe, based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, that we are the market leader in specialty chemicals for the Consumer Solutions segment. Based on the same report, we believe that we maintain market leadership positions in almost all technologies and regions. The competitive landscape, as segmented by geography or technology, remains fragmented. We have particularly strong market positions in process chemicals within the biocide, contaminant control, defoamer, tissue specialties and pulp specialties technologies. Our strength is based on the complete product portfolio, premium product performance and strong technical support we offer. We believe we have the best and the broadest offering to help customers achieve their operational efficiencies. We are a trusted supplier known for our data analytics capacities, with a focus on service excellence, sustainability, productivity and cost savings for our customers. Many customers are starting to embrace digital technology / data analytics to help track performance and starting to partner with suppliers with strong R&D capabilities to develop innovative solutions to drive efficiency and achieve sustainability objectives. This trend is expected to continue and we expect to benefit from it due to our robust value-added chemistry and technology solutions offering. _Industrial Solutions_ The global industrial water chemicals market is fragmented, with the top seven players, based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021. This is due to the required application-specific expertise and track-record of performance. Hence, by region and by end-user market, three to five players may have a disproportionately high share. We believe we have an outsized share of the global pulp and paper market, which is one of our larger markets within the Industrial Solutions segment. We believe we offer the lowest per unit cost for comparable chemicals compared to our industry peers and believe that the competitive pricing is our greatest strength in the Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we offer an array of innovative solutions and comprehensive product lines both in core water treatment and wastewater segment. Notable competitors include Ecolab / Nalco, Suez, ChemTreat, Kurita, Kemira and SNF. Ecolab, which acquired Nalco in 2011, is the largest water treatment player followed by Suez. Similar to the Consumer market, technology and R&D are becoming increasingly important beyond the chemical product itself as customers are moving towards advanced analytics to optimize the volume of chemical treatment, driving select industry participants to increasingly focus on equipment / engineering solutions as opposed to chemical solutions. 20 ----- _Pool Solutions_ We believe we are the only true global player in the Pool Solutions segment with leading market positions in North America, South America, and EMEA. We believe the acquisition of Clearon further enhanced our market leading position. Our primary competitor in this segment is KIK Custom Products, which provides various pool chemical solutions, with a focus on North America. Other smaller competitors also compete in this market, with varying breadth and geographical focus, including Hasa Pool, Jandy, Lo-chlor and Jack’s Magic. We believe we are the world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment and sanitation. All three of our cal-hypo facilities are co-located with chlor-alkali producers meaning that raw materials (chlorine and caustic soda) are delivered into our production plants via a direct pipeline. We believe this is a major competitive advantage and barrier to entry in the Pool Solutions segment as we believe it would not be economical for our competitors to open a new cal-hypo facility that is not co-located with a supply of raw materials. The acquisition of Clearon provided additional manufacturing capabilities for trichlor and dichlor and we are now the only producer of cal-hypo, trichlor and dichlor, which we believe will give us a significant advantage over our competitors. Further, Clearon’s manufacturing facility located in West Virginia was isolated from the impact of natural disasters that other competitors have experienced with facilities located on the Gulf Coast. _Institutional Solutions_ Diversey is a major global player in the Institutional Solutions segment and competes primarily with Ecolab. Other competitors in this segment include: SC Johnson, Gojo, Kalykim and Jasol. In this highly fragmented market, Diversey and Ecolab together hold approximately a 20% global market share. Geographically, Diversey believes it is the number one or number two player in the North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. Other competitors are focused on niche segments and geographies, focusing on regional and local customers. Diversey is positioned to compete using a recurring revenue business model built on consumable products that require periodic replacement and high customer switching costs via a suite of proprietary dosing and dispensing equipment installed at customer sites. Further, to better compete with Ecolab in North America, Diversey is in the process of opening a new co-manufacturing / co-warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky, alongside consolidating certain existing service centers to increase manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be better positioned to compete with Ecolab for leadership across all markets. We believe that the combined company is best positioned to capture share on a global scale due to Diversey’s strong existing market position, combined with our own position and track record of sustained growth and the white space afforded by such a fragmented market. _Food & Beverage_ Diversey is one of the only two global players in the Food & Beverage segment and competes primarily with Ecolab. The Food & Beverage market is largely consolidated and Diversey and Ecolab together hold approximately half of the global market share. Ecolab and Diversey generally compete within cleaning and hygiene solutions. Other, smaller competitors exist including Zep, Reckitt and Kersia. These players tend to service more regional markets and operate with highly limited product and distribution capabilities. Prior to the Transactions, we entered into a distribution relationship with Diversey through which we provide water treatment products to be marketed to Diversey’s existing customer base within its Food & Beverage segment. This current offering sets Diversey apart from Ecolab and represents an opportunity for additional market capture and cross-selling in the future following the consummation of the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Through Solenis’ value-documentation program, sales teams have accountability requirements to show that at least 5% of Net sales deliver a value advantage to customers, which enables price capture even in deflationary environments. This has enabled us to pass through a majority of increases in raw chemical materials, which are one of the major drivers for cost inflation, to customers by adjusting prices accordingly. We began to see a significant increase in the price of our raw materials, including ethylene and propylene, during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and we began to pass on price increases to our customers. Typically, we experience an approximately 90-day lag in implementing our price increases, however, during the six months ended March 31, 2023, we exceeded our goals and were able to drive price increases even faster with price exceeding cost during the six months ended March 31, 2023 in all of our business segments. While Diversey continues to adjust prices to pass through increases in raw materials costs, Diversey was slower to react to the inflationary cost environment than Solenis, which resulted in more pronounced margin compression throughout 2022 than Solenis. Once combined, Diversey’s performance is expected to improve as they will operate on Solenis’ value-documentation program. Typically, Diversey experiences an approximately 90-day lag in implementing our price increases, however, during the six months ended March 31, 2023, Diversey exceeded its goals and was able to drive price increases even faster with Cost of goods sold inflation during the six months ended March 31, 2023 in its Institutional Solutions and Food & Beverage segments.

We estimate that the markets adjacent to our market represent a total market size of $42 billion and represent potential expansion areas, including the ion exchange and coagulants markets. We believe that we can create significant value through strategic acquisitions given our track record of integration. Solenis has completed 17 acquisitions since 2014, including the transformative and successful merger with BASF’s water and paper business in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and the Solenis Acquisition in fiscal year 2022. We will focus on maintaining a disciplined acquisition strategy centered on: (i) expanding our customer base in new and growing end markets and geographies; (ii) improving our customer offering through access to new products and technological capabilities; and (iii) generating significant purchasing and other operational synergies.

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,9,SUMMARY,9.24,Growth Strategy,9.24.5,Strategically Invest in High Return Capital Expenditures Expansion,"Our key capital expenditure projects include production capacity expansion for polyvinyl amine (“PVAM”) at our Suffolk, Virginia facility and calcium hypochlorite (cal-hypo) at our Charleston, Tennessee and Kempton Park, South Africa facilities. Our expansion efforts will eliminate existing capacity constraints and better position us to capitalize on customer demand for these high-margin products. Our engineering estimates for all facilities are underway with expansion efforts expected to be online in 2026. We expect the PVAM and cal-hypo expansions to cost $150 million and $100 million, respectively. A majority of our customers, especially those producing packaging and tissue and towel products, are focused on improving strength. We are a market leader in strength chemistry, with the broadest portfolio of synthetic strength additives like PVAM and are the leading supplier of global PVAM production. Previously PVAM was originally sold by BASF and we acquired full commercial rights as part of 2019 merger. However, in advance of the merger, BASF raised prices substantially, resulting in lost sales. Post integration, we refilled the pipeline and returned the product to growth, however, in recent years, our PVAM volumes have been constrained despite debottlenecking programs implemented and we have been unable to return to pre-BASF merger levels. Further, in fiscal year 2022, we experienced shutdowns and product issues resulting in production allocation and customer management challenges. To solve our capacity constraint, we are looking to build incremental capacity at our existing Suffolk, Virginia facility, which is expected to be online by the end of 2026 that will enable us to increase capacity by approximately 100%. Cal-hypo is a highly concentrated source of chlorine in solid form and is a cost-effective solution primarily used for pool sanitization and maintenance with secondary uses to disinfect water in industrial and municipal markets. Our Solenis HTH[ TM] and Poolife[TM] offerings are cal-hypo-based shocks that eliminate the need to drain and refill pools due to over stabilization with other benefits including minimized storage requirements, dry formulation for shelf stability and easy handling, reduced shipping and handling costs and reduced maintenance. We are currently experiencing capacity constraints at our Kempton Park, South Africa facility. Further, given over 50% of global supply is produced in either China or India, importing incremental capacity is both challenging and costly. Due to these constraints, we are looking to expand our capacity. Expansion efforts at our Kempton Park facility are underway and are expected to be completed by fiscal year ended 2023 or 2024. Further, we are pursuing a site selection process for additional capacity including assessing potential new locations, with the expectation that all facilities will be online by 2026. In the interim, we will look to temporarily source incremental capacity via third parties to pre-seed the plant which we believe will drive top line growth in the near team and insourcing savings in the future. Following its return to the United States market, Diversey’s current management team identified potential manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities by re-positioning and consolidating certain existing service centers. This supply chain improvement process is referred to as “Project Mega.” Project Mega includes a largely complete consolidation of the North American supply chain footprint through the creation of a manufacturing plant and co-located warehouse in Northern Kentucky, as well as warehouse consolidation in Europe. Diversey started shipping from the new Kentucky warehouse in July 2022 and is consolidating its manufacturing capabilities into the same Kentucky facility. Further, Project Mega is consolidating five Diversey (three Institutional and two Food & Beverage) plants into four plants (two Institutional and two Food & Beverage) and is planning on closing two Wisconsin plants. By co-locating its main warehouse and manufacturing capabilities, and adding more capacity to bring currently contracted volumes in-house and optimizing freight lanes, the project is expected to drive approximately $30 million of annual cost savings. The run rate cost savings includes $11 million related to manufacturing efficiencies from increased insourcing from contract manufacturers, more efficient lines and fixed absorption, co-location of liquid manufacturing and wipes conversion and an optimized flow of processes, $10 million related to logistics and the ability to avoid shipping between sites along with having new sites closer to suppliers and customers, $7 million related to direct savings achieved from materials sourcing using larger orders (i.e. from drums to bulk orders), $1 million related to warehousing from lower rent and co-locating with manufacturing and $2 million related to other.

As of March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions: - we would have had total indebtedness of 7.3 billion (excluding existing letters of credit, performance guarantees and local lines of credit), $6.6 billion of which would have been secured (without giving effect to unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs), including the Notes offered hereby; 41 ----- - we would have had unused commitments under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility available to us of $640 million, subject to borrowing base capacity; and - our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 43% of our total liabilities (excluding intercompany payables), all of which would have been structurally senior to the Notes. See “Capitalization” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all obligations of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.” Additional Amounts .....................** Any payments made by the Issuer or any Guarantor with respect to the Notes will be made without withholding or deduction for taxes unless required by law. If such withholding or deduction is required by law in any “relevant taxing jurisdiction,” subject to certain exceptions, the Issuer or the relevant Guarantor, as applicable, will pay the additional amounts necessary so that the net amounts received by the holders of the Notes after the withholding or deduction is not less than the amount that they would have received in the absence of the withholding or deduction, subject to certain exceptions. See “Description of Notes—Withholding Taxes.” Optional Redemption ...................** Each series of Notes will be redeemable at the Issuer’s option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after June 1, 2025, at the redemption prices set forth in this offering memorandum, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes with an amount equal to the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of      % of the principal amount of the Dollar Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Dollar Notes then outstanding and (y) $ million aggregate principal amount of Dollar Notes remains outstanding (except to the extent all remaining Dollar Notes are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture). At any time prior to June 1, 2025, the Issuer may redeem up to 40% of the principal amount of the Euro Notes with an amount equal to the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of      % of the principal amount of the Euro Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption, so long as the lesser of (x) 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Euro Notes then outstanding and (y) € million aggregate principal amount of Euro Notes remains outstanding (except to the extent all remaining Euro Notes are otherwise repurchased or redeemed at such time in accordance with the terms of the Indenture).

In connection with any offer to purchase a series of Notes (including a change of control offer and any tender offer), if holders of no less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Notes validly tender their Notes, the Issuer is entitled to redeem any remaining Notes of such series at the price offered to each holder. See “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” In the event of certain developments affecting taxation that become effective after the Issue Date, the Issuer may redeem a series of Notes, as applicable, in whole but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

If this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will issue the Notes and deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of each series of Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments therein. The Escrow Release will be subject to the Escrow Release Conditions. Unless the Acquisition closes substantially concurrently with, or prior to, this offering, substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will consummate the Escrow Merger, pursuant to which it will merge with and into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately continuing as the surviving entity. Assuming the Escrow Release Conditions have been satisfied, on the Acquisition Closing Date, the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will become parties to the Indenture pursuant to one or more supplemental indentures, the Escrow Issuer will cease to exist as a result of the Escrow Merger and the obligations under the Indenture will become obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors. The escrowed funds will be released from escrow to consummate the Acquisition even if a default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—If the Acquisition is completed on or prior to the Outside Date and the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, the proceeds from the Notes will be released from escrow even if a default or event of default under the Indenture has or would have occurred and is continuing.” In the event that (a) the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Escrow Release Conditions are deemed, in the Escrow Issuer’s good faith judgment, to be incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date, or (c) at any time prior to the Outside Date, the Acquisition Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms without the closing of the Acquisition, each series of Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption at a price equal to 100% of the initial issue price of such series of Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, to, but excluding, the date of such special mandatory redemption. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the 43 ----- Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the applicable series of Notes.” If this offering closes substantially concurrently with the consummation of the Acquisition, the Notes will not be subject to the escrow procedures described in this offering memorandum. For additional information regarding the terms of, and procedures relating to, the escrow, see “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” Change of Control Offer ..............** Upon the occurrence of specific kinds of change in control, subject to certain exceptions, you will have the right, as holders of each series of Notes, to cause the Issuer to repurchase some or all of each series of your Notes at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes— Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.” The Issuer may not be able to pay you the required price for Notes you present to it at the time of a change of control because: - the Issuer may not have enough funds at that time; or - the terms of our Credit Facilities or other debt facilities may prevent the Issuer from making such payment. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.” Asset Sale Offer ............................** If Parent or any of its restricted subsidiaries sell assets, under certain circumstances, the Issuer will be required to use the net proceeds to make an offer to purchase each series of Notes at an offer price in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount of such series of Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date. See “Description of Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales.” Covenants ......................................** The Issuer will issue the Notes under the Indenture. The Indenture will, among other things, limit the ability of Parent and its restricted subsidiaries to: - incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; - pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, its capital stock; - prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt; - issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; - make loans and investments; - sell assets; 44 ----- - incur liens; - enter into agreements containing prohibitions affecting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; - enter into transactions with affiliates; and - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of its assets. These covenants will be subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. For more details, see “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants.” Certain covenants will cease to apply to the Notes if, and for so long as, the Notes have investment grade ratings from certain rating agencies and there is no default or event of default under the Indenture. See “Description of Notes—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade.” Transfer Restrictions ....................** The Issuer has not registered the Notes under the Securities Act, and the Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability and resale. The Issuer does not intend to issue registered notes under the Securities Act or any state or other securities laws in exchange for the Notes to be privately placed in this offering, and the absence of registration rights may adversely impact the transferability of the Notes.

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"Risks and impacts of the war in Ukraine on our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.","The U.S. and global markets are currently experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the ongoing war in Ukraine. In response to such invasion, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (“NATO”) deployed additional military forces to eastern Europe and the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have announced various sanctions and restrictive actions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities, including the removal of certain financial institutions from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) payment system. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the resulting measures that have been taken, and that could be taken in the future, by NATO, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other countries have created global security concerns that could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Although the severity and duration of the ongoing war in Ukraine is impossible to predict, the active conflict could lead to market disruptions, including significant and prolonged volatility in commodity prices, credit and capital markets, as well as supply chain interruptions. Additionally, Russian military actions and the resulting sanctions could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and lead to instability and lack of liquidity in capital markets. We conduct operations in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded. If we fail to comply knowingly or unknowingly with sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations, we could be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of licenses, or a cessation of operations, as well as damage to our image and reputation. There is no guarantee that we will be able to quickly and completely adapt our business model to changes that could result from these recent events, and any such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The effects of the war in Ukraine, resulting sanctions and any related market disruptions could be substantial, particularly if current or new sanctions continue for an extended period of time or if geopolitical tensions result in expanded military operations on a global scale. Most of the significant factors arising out of the ongoing war in Ukraine are beyond our control and any such disruptions may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Although our business has not been materially impacted by the war in Ukraine to date, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations, or those of our suppliers, will be impacted in the short and long term, or the ways in which the conflict may impact our business. If these disruptions or other matters of global concern continue for an extended period of time, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,Our cash and cash equivalents may be exposed to failure of our banking institutions.,"While we seek to minimize our exposure to third-party losses of our cash and cash equivalents, we hold our balances in a number of large financial institutions, which are subject to the risk of failure. For example, on March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”) was unable to continue its operations and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) was appointed as receiver for SVB and created the National Bank of Santa Clara to hold the deposits of SVB. As of the date of this offering memorandum, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are held with other large financial institutions, and we do not expect further developments with SVB to have a material 58 ----- impact on our cash and cash equivalents balance, business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. However, we regularly maintain cash balances with other financial institutions in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. Therefore, if further failures in financial institutions occur where we hold deposits, we could experience additional risk. Any such loss or limitation on our cash and cash equivalents would adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, widespread investor concerns regarding the U.S. or international financial systems could result in less favorable commercial financing terms, including higher interest rates or costs and tighter financial and operating covenants, or systemic limitations on access to credit and liquidity sources, thereby making it more difficult for us to acquire financing on acceptable terms or at all. Any decline in available funding or access to our cash and liquidity resources could, among other risks, adversely impact our ability to meet our operating expenses, financial obligations or fulfill our other obligations, result in breaches of our financial and/or contractual obligations or result in violations of federal or state wage and hour laws. Any of these impacts, or any other impacts resulting from the factors described above or other related or similar factors not described above, could have material adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"Our business may be adversely affected by the current commodities market conditions and the current inflationary environment as we face risks related to the volatile energy prices which could significantly disrupt our operations, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.","We are closely monitoring the current price fluctuations in the commodities markets and in particular natural gas, electricity, diesel and crude oil, as well as the current inflationary environment. The continuing increase and volatility of gas prices may result in an increase of prices across our product lines, labor and other costs due to market conditions including significant inflation, supply chain disruptions, transportation issues or raw material shortages, among other challenges. Our exposure to these price fluctuations is not uniform and their impact may vary between product lines and geographic regions. In the current inflationary environment, depending on the terms of our contracts and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins and returns. In addition, the rate of inflation may be impacted by geopolitical events, including the current conflict in Ukraine and the implementation of sanctions related thereto, that can cause the price of oil, gas and other commodities to increase, which can further increase supply and labor costs. Although we have implemented a number of mitigation mechanisms, we cannot guarantee that these will bring about the desired effect. Most of the significant factors arising out of the ongoing price volatility are beyond our control and any such disruptions may also have the effect of heightening the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. If these disruptions or other matters of global commodities markets concerns, such as potential natural gas rationing to be implemented in Europe, continue for an extended period of time, our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,"Our business may be adversely affected by an epidemic, pandemic or any other public health crisis and we may face risks related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H1N1 influenza, H5N1 influenza, H7N9 influenza, H3N2 influenza and COVID-19 which could significantly disrupt our operations, customer demand, and our suppliers’ ability to support us, resulting in material adverse impacts to our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.","The widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable diseases, or any public health crisis that results in economic or trade disruptions could negatively impact our business and the businesses of our customers. Our results of operation may be affected by the impact on the global economy and businesses that COVID19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) has had to date or may have in the future. Global financial markets have suffered downturns and volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may, as a result of the resurgence of existing or the emergence of new COVID-19 strains (or similar outbreaks or pandemics), continue to have sustained impact on businesses across the world. Such similar volatility and downturn could have an impact on the liquidity of the Notes. Risks relating to COVID-19 and future pandemics or epidemics may become more expensive or impossible to insure against. If any of the global impacts of COVID-19 resurge for a sustained period of time, and should any of the risks identified above materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our performance. 59 ----- We are also susceptible to supply chain difficulties and are reliant on delivery of products to customers and on delivery of materials from suppliers. If the supply chain becomes disrupted, or is delayed, as a result of a COVID-19 resurgence, then this may have an impact on our performance. Additionally, any disruption in freight may give rise to raw material and freight cost increases which may also impact our business. In addition, we may experience higher costs in certain areas as a result of COVID-19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) such as transportation and logistics, warehouse, and production employee compensation, as well as incremental costs associated with health screenings and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees at our facilities, which may be necessary in these or other areas. Any resurgence of COVID-19 may lead to further deterioration of economic conditions, employment markets and/or equity markets and further disruptions to supply chains, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. It is possible that a resurgence of COVID-19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) will cause an economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. There is a significant degree of uncertainty and lack of visibility as to the extent and duration of any such slowdown or recession. Given the significant economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic, it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impacts on demand for our products. These expectations are subject to change without warning and investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on them. A resurgence of COVID-19 could result in a significant downturn in our end markets and a significant drop in demand for some of our products and services, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, any permanent increase in and acceptance of remote and hybrid working arrangements may continue to adversely impact our revenues and business model in our business and industry sector. There is the risk that certain mitigation and cost-saving initiatives to date may not be sustainable or repeatable, or that the prolonged effects of COVID-19 may be different than what we have experienced thus far, including permanent closures of client facilities or reductions in product and service offerings. For example, economic uncertainty throughout 2022 was due to not only the COVID-19 pandemic, but also the war in Ukraine, energy price rises and cost of living increases. Global economies have recorded low levels of growth as they emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, and this has been compounded with increased geo-political uncertainty due to the war in Ukraine. These events if worsened may have a significant impact on the performance on the business. A resurgence of COVID-19 (or another pandemic or epidemic) could result in significant downturn in the demand for our products and may lead to public health bodies imposing measures on the population that may impact our ability to manufacture or impact our end markets.

Such conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on certain markets we serve (i.e., Graphic and Oil & Gas markets) where global economic downturns can cause weakened demand. Conversely, other markets (i.e., Packaging and Tissue & Towel) can see an uptick in demand in these phases of the cycle; however, there can be no assurance of this. During economic downturns or recessions, there can be heightened competition for sales and increased pressure to reduce selling prices as our customers may reduce their volume of purchases from us. If we lose significant sales volume or reduce selling prices significantly, then there could be a negative impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations, profitability and cash flows. We depend upon the availability of credit to operate our business. Reduced availability of credit may also adversely affect the ability of some of our customers and suppliers to obtain funds for operations and capital expenditures. Instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets such as those likely to be caused by the current environment of rising interest rates could adversely impact the availability of future financing and the terms on which it might be available to us, our customers and our suppliers. This could negatively impact our ability to obtain necessary supplies as well as our sales of materials and equipment to affected customers.

A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the U.S. and a majority of our Net sales are generated outside of the U.S. These operations, particularly in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present in or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include: - non-U.S. currency exchange controls and tax rates; - non-U.S. currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; - the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; - restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including anti-dumping duties, tariffs, embargoes, economic sanctions, and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; - changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the U.S. affecting trade and foreign investment; - the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain non-U.S. legal systems; - variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; - more expansive legal rights of workers outside the U.S., unions, collective bargaining agreements or works councils; - changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; - import and export delays; - social plans and regulations that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; - the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and - unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against the countries in which we operate or other interests. In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from the various jurisdictions in which we do business.

We translate sales and other results denominated in non-U.S. currency into U.S. dollars for our consolidated combined financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, many of our operations buy materials and incur expenses in a currency other than their functional currency. As a result, we 61 ----- are exposed to currency fluctuations both in receiving cash from our international operations and in translating our financial results back to U.S. dollars. During periods of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and net income could be reduced because non-U.S. currencies may translate into fewer U.S. dollars. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results. As exchange rates vary, our results of operations and profitability may be harmed. While we may use financial instruments to hedge certain non-U.S. currency exposures, this does not insulate us completely from non-U.S. currency effects and exposes us to counterparty credit risk for non-performance. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial effect resulting from non-U.S. currency variations. The gains or losses associated with hedging activities may harm our results of operations. In all jurisdictions in which we operate, we are also subject to laws and regulations that govern non-U.S. investment, non-U.S. trade and currency exchange transactions. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to repatriate cash as dividends or otherwise to the U.S. and may limit our ability to convert non-U.S. currency cash flows into U.S. dollars. We have recognized foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to the currency devaluations in Argentina in September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 as a result of the country being designated as highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

As some of our customers operate in the hospitality industry that supports both domestic and international tourism, their business and indirectly ours, could be exposed to the negative consequences of travel pattern disruptions due to major terrorist threats. Also, if additional restrictions on trade with China were adopted by the U.S., the European Union or the United Nations, and were applicable to our products, we could lose sales and experience lower growth rates in the future.

The prices for these raw materials are cyclical and are currently experiencing a prolonged period of heightened prices due, in part, to the war in Ukraine, and increases in market demand or fluctuations in the global trade for petrochemical-based raw materials and energy could increase our costs. In addition, the prices of many of the other key raw materials used in our businesses, such as caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates, surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates and fragrances, are cyclical based on numerous supply and demand factors that are beyond our control. Furthermore, the usage of certain chemical components used in the manufacturing of our products, such as chemicals used in our surfactants, may be limited or restricted by government regulations, which could restrict our sourcing options. If we are unable to minimize the effects of increased raw material costs through sourcing, pricing or other actions, our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Moreover, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to provide raw materials that meet our specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules as well as all regulatory requirements. We seek to purchase our principal raw materials through negotiated long-term contracts in order to ensure availability of such raw materials. In some cases, there may only be a limited number of suitable suppliers available for certain raw materials, which increases our dependence on parties that we have no control over. While alternative raw materials may be available, these may be more expensive and not always compatible with our production processes. 62 ----- Natural disasters, as well as political instability, such as the war in Ukraine, and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers. These factors could lead to increased prices for our raw materials, curtailment of supplies and allocation of raw materials by our suppliers, which could reduce revenues and profit margins and harm relations with our customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. In particular, customers, consumers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. Changing consumer preferences may result in increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic packaging, and other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability; a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients; or increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products. These demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands. Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including disclosure requirements, or environmental causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy, raw materials or compliance with emissions standards, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation. If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products. A significant and rapid decline in the use of certain chemicals, such as chemicals for packaging and board production, or in the demand of customers’ products, such as certain paper qualities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly in the Consumer Solutions segment. Also increased awareness of and concern towards climate change and more sustainable products may change customers’ demands, for example towards water treatment technologies with lower chemical consumption, and this may have a negative effect particularly on the ability of the Industrial Solutions segment to compete. Furthermore, if our products fail to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or have a shorter useful life than guaranteed, a customer could cease to use our products and services. Customers in the food service, food and beverage processing, building care, lodging, industrial distribution and healthcare sectors have been consolidating in recent years, and we believe this trend may continue. Such consolidation could have an adverse impact on the pricing of our products and services and our ability to retain customers.

If we do not successfully develop innovative products, it may be difficult to differentiate our products from our competitors’ products and satisfy regulatory requirements, and our sales and results could suffer. Our competitive advantage is due in part to our ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins. Maintaining this advantage is essential, especially in light of the reduction in barriers for even small competitors to quickly introduce new brands and products directly to consumers that e-commerce permits. The development and introduction cycle of new products can be lengthy and involve high levels of investment.

Under the terms of the initial carve-out of the Solenis business from Ashland when it was acquired by CD&R (as defined herein) in July 2014, Solenis UK International Limited is indemnified for certain pre-existing environmental remediation costs. In the event of the insolvency, liquidation, reorganization, dissolution or other winding up of Ashland, we may stand to recover less than the indemnification provisions entitle us to or we may not recover any amount at all. In connection with the joint venture arrangement, whereby Solenis merged with P&W business of BASF in January 2019, BASF transferred various production facilities to Solenis UK International Limited. During the diligence process related to the acquisition, diligence was performed related to potential environmental liabilities. As 68 ----- of March 31, 2023, we did not have material contingent environmental obligations which are both probable and estimable related to these production facilities or other real property acquired from BASF. As of March 31, 2023, we have recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, which are related to two environmental remediation matters. Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million is accrued liability relating to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million of accrued liability relates to potential exposure related to ground contamination at our Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve of accrued liability for a potential exposure related to a United States Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management’s best estimate of total expenses to be incurred. There can be no guarantee that such indemnifications or reserves will be sufficient to cover any or all environmental remediation costs or otherwise in connection with such matters. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations generally provide onerous requirements for companies that are found to be responsible for violations, often irrespective of actual fault. As a result, we could be subject to future claims, investigations or proceedings that may impose fines or remedial obligations, either in excess of existing indemnifications or reserves, or in respect of future pollution, hazardous wastes or other environmental issues at the sites at which we own or operate. In addition, we could be affected by business interruptions due to authorities closing entire facilities or parts thereof. If we become subject to one or more such environmental liabilities, this could have a negative impact on our reputation as well as a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A “material weakness” is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness that was identified was related to the design and operation of controls related to inventory exercise and revenue recognition. These material weaknesses arose because Diversey’s controls were not effectively designed, documented and maintained to ensure the existence of inventory at certain locations and to address the timing of revenue recognition and the completeness and accuracy of information used to estimate and accrue customer rebates. To remedy the identified material weaknesses, Diversey is in the process of enhancing the design of certain internal controls over the inventory and revenue process by: - enhancing controls to monitor the frequency and accuracy of cycle count procedures globally; - enhancing documentation associated with management review controls and validation of the completeness and accuracy of key reports used across the inventory process; - enhancing controls over inventory existence for inventory located at third-party logistics providers; 72 ----- - enhancing procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of key financial data utilized in the calculation of accrued customer rebates; - enhancing controls to monitor revenue cutoff risk based on the shipping terms in contracts with customers; and - providing additional training related to validating the accuracy of data used in key review controls and the level of documentation required. Diversey will not be able to fully remediate the material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. If Diversey is unable to further implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, its ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject Diversey to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses and negatively affect investor confidence in its financial statements. If Diversey is unable to assert that its internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if its independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of its financial reports. Furthermore, Diversey cannot guarantee that the measures it has taken to date, and actions it may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. Diversey’s current controls and any new controls that it develops may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in its business. Further, weaknesses in Diversey’s disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm Diversey’s operating results or cause it to fail to meet its reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of its financial statements for prior periods.

For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions our cash interest expense would have been approximately $469 million based on the estimated blended effective interest rate utilized in the “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information.” This figure has not been updated to reflect the actual size of the Notes offered hereby or the actual interest expense, sizing between the Dollar and Euro tranches or exchange rates with respect to the Notes, which could differ materially.

If this position is respected, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation would not recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions. It is possible, however, that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) could take a contrary view and seek to treat such holders as exchanging the Notes for “new” Notes in a deemed taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully asserted this position, such holders would be required to recognize any gain or loss in connection with such exchange and would have a new holding period and a new tax basis in the “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

The source of funds for any repurchase of the Notes and repayment of borrowings under the Credit Facilities would be available cash or cash generated from our subsidiaries’ operations or other sources, including borrowings, sales of assets or sales of equity. We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control because we may not have sufficient financial resources to purchase all of the Notes that are tendered upon a change of control and repay our other indebtedness that will become due at such time. We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and we may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. If we fail to repurchase the Notes of any series in that circumstance, we will be in default under the Indenture. Further, our ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the Notes and events of default and potential breaches of each of the Credit Agreements, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, some important corporate events, such as leveraged recapitalizations or the sale of our company to a public company that does not have a majority shareholder, may not, under the Indenture, constitute a “change of control” that would require us to repurchase the Notes, even though those corporate events could increase the level of our indebtedness or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure, credit ratings or the value of the Notes.

In the event a change of control offer or asset sale is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing Notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions. If we do not obtain consent or repay those borrowings, we will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes.

Under the Bankruptcy Code and other fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state and jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the Notes or the guarantees or the related security interests could be avoided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if the Issuer or any or the Guarantors, as applicable, (a) is determined to have issued the Notes and/or incurred the guarantees or the related security interests with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing the Notes and/or incurring the guarantees or the related security interests and, in the case of clause (b) only, one or more of the following is also true at the time thereof: - the Issuer or the Guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees or the related security interests; - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees or the related security interests left the Issuer or any of the Guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business engaged in or contemplated; - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors intended to, or believed that the Issuer or such Guarantor would, incur debts beyond the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or 84 ----- - the Issuer or any of the Guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against the Issuer or the Guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a Guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee or the related security interests to the extent the Guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, because the guarantee was incurred for the Issuer’s benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, if a court were to find that the applicable Guarantor were insolvent or rendered insolvent by the incurrence of the guarantee or one of the other conditions above (relating to the Guarantor’s financial condition) were satisfied, the court could avoid the obligations under the guarantees and the related security interests, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes, including requiring the return of prior payments thereon. Courts in different jurisdictions may measure solvency differently, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not the Issuer or the Guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that the Issuer or a Guarantor were indeed insolvent on that date, that any payments to the holders of the Notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds, or whether the Notes or any guarantees would be subordinated to the Issuer’s or any of the Guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent and prospective liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit a Guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent transfer or conveyance. This provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect the guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent transfer or conveyance law, or may reduce or eliminate the Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes the guarantee worthless. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee or the related security interests was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee, could avoid the liens securing the Notes and the related guarantees, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer or of the related Guarantor or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes, or may receive only a partial repayment. Further, the avoidance of the Notes or the guarantees could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt. In addition, any payment by the Issuer pursuant to the Notes or by a Guarantor under a guarantee made at a time the Issuer or such Guarantor were found to be insolvent could be avoided and required to be returned to the Issuer or such Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Issuer’s or such Guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an “insider” within a one-year period prior to a bankruptcy filing or within 90 days for any other party, and such payment would give the recipient thereof more than such party would have received in a distribution under the Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case, subject to applicable defenses. 85 ----- Also, no assurance can be given that no party in interest would not challenge any of the transactions in connection with the Acquisition as a fraudulent transfer, fraudulent conveyance, or otherwise in any insolvency proceedings, or what the outcome of any such challenge would be. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may subordinate the claims in respect of the Notes or the guarantees to other claims against us under the principle of equitable subordination if the court determines that (1) the holder of the Notes or the guarantees engaged in some type of inequitable conduct, (2) the inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holders of the Notes and (3) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

To the extent the Current Asset Collateral is released from securing the obligations secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in certain circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the agent under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or in connection with a sale or other disposition of the Current Asset Collateral permitted under the terms of both the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Indenture), the second-priority liens securing the Notes in the Current Asset Collateral will automatically also be released. In addition, the Indenture and the security documents related to the holders of Notes’ second-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral until such first-priority lien obligations are paid in full, and the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the security documents related to the first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral securing the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements without the consent of the Notes Collateral Agent. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the Notes would be required to turn over to the holders of obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility amounts they receive from the Issuer with respect to the Current Asset Collateral. We cannot assure you that in the event of a foreclosure by the holders of the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility or a bankruptcy event, the proceeds from the sale of the Current Asset Collateral would be sufficient to satisfy all or any of the amounts outstanding under the Notes after payment in full of the obligations secured by such first-priority liens on the Current Asset Collateral, including all obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes— Security—Intercreditor Arrangements.” In addition, in the event of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, if the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility desire to permit any use of cash collateral consisting of Current Asset Collateral or our obtaining debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing that is secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, the holders of the Notes would (assuming certain protections and other requirements are in place with respect to their liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with such use of cash collateral or DIP financing) agree not to raise objections to such use of cash collateral or DIP financing, and the holders of the Notes would also agree to having their liens on the Current Asset Collateral be subordinated to the liens thereon securing such DIP financing or providing adequate protection to the lenders under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also limit the right of the holders of the Notes to raise various other objections or take various other actions in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Current Asset Collateral prior to the payment in full of the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility, including, among other things, seeking relief from the “automatic stay” with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, and will also place certain restrictions on their right to seek “adequate protection” of their interests in the Current Asset Collateral from a bankruptcy court, even if such holders’ rights with respect to such collateral were being affected. 91 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, any actions that may be taken with respect to the Collateral by any such holders, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the Collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the exclusive direction of the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the date on which our obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (or any refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) are no longer secured pursuant to the terms of the documents governing the Term Loan Credit Agreement or (2) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under any agreement governing obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first priority basis that constitutes the largest series of all obligations subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (solely to the extent that such series of obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the obligations under our Term Loan Credit Agreement then outstanding), is not stayed from pursuing any such exercise pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that is continuing and acceleration of such series of obligations, so long as the Term Loan Collateral Agent has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral or none of the Issuer or the Guarantors is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to our Term Loan Credit Agreement, at which time the parties to our Term Loan Credit Agreement will no longer have the exclusive right to direct the actions with respect to the collateral securing the Notes pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the right to direct such actions will pass to the collateral agent of holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by first priority liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral. Assuming that the holders of the Notes represent the largest outstanding principal amount, if we issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the Notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the Notes or if the Existing Secured Notes have a greater principal amount than the Notes, then the collateral agent for such additional indebtedness or the Existing Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the Collateral. In addition, under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, if at any time the controlling fixed asset collateral agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any collateral resulting in a sale thereof, the lien securing the Notes on such collateral will be automatically released and discharged (provided that any proceeds from such sale are applied ratably among all the then outstanding first priority obligations secured on a first-priority basis by the Fixed Asset Collateral). The Collateral so released will no longer secure our and the Guarantors’ obligations under the Notes and the guarantees. Additionally, in the event of a bankruptcy filing, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the holders of the Notes with respect to their rights to object to proposed DIP financing or the use of cash collateral or to the liens securing such DIP financing that has been consented to by the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and that satisfy certain terms and conditions. Also, under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, in the event that the holders of the Notes obtain possession of any Collateral or realize any proceeds or payment in respect of any such Collateral at any time prior to the discharge of each of the other obligations secured by first-priority liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral, then such holders will be obligated to hold such Collateral, proceeds, or payment in trust for the other holders of such firstpriority obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds, or payment, as the case may be, to the controlling collateral agent under the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, to be distributed (subject to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral), in accordance with the provisions of such agreement among all the holders of obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis.

No appraisal of the value of the Collateral has been made in connection with this offering, and the fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of industries in which we operate, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy or similar proceeding, the Collateral may not be sold in a timely, orderly or value-maximizing manner, and the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral may not be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Notes, in full or at all, after first satisfying in full (from the Current Asset Collateral) our obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility that are secured by a first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral and after taking into account the pari passu obligations under our Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Notes. There also can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time (or at all) in an orderly manner. To the extent that liens, rights or easements granted to third parties encumber assets located on property owned by us, such third parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to such liens that could adversely affect the value of the Collateral and the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent acting for the benefit of itself, the Trustee or the holders of the Notes to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. Accordingly, there may not be sufficient Collateral to pay all or any of the amounts due on the Notes. Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of the Collateral and any unpaid obligations under the Notes will rank equally in right of payment with any claim of all of our other senior unsecured, unsubordinated indebtedness and trade payables, against our and our Guarantors’ remaining assets. Moreover, the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and any other obligation secured by _pari passu liens, such as the Existing Secured Notes, will share the proceeds of the Collateral ratably with the_ holders of the Notes, thereby diluting the collateral coverage. The Collateral may also secure additional pari passu indebtedness that we may incur in the future. Your rights to the Collateral would be further diluted by an increase in the additional pari passu indebtedness secured by the Collateral.

In addition, the holders of the Notes would not be entitled to “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws with respect to any undersecured, deficiency portion of the Notes existing as of the commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding.

The liens on the Collateral from time to time owned by us securing obligations under the Notes may not be perfected if we have not taken the actions necessary to perfect any of those liens. Our inability or failure to promptly take all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral may result in the loss of the priority, or a defect in the perfection of the security interest for the benefit of the holders of the Notes to which they would have been otherwise entitled. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Furthermore, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent in the Collateral may not be in place on the date that the Notes are issued. Although, under the Indenture and the security documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to grant the security interest to the Notes Collateral Agent, no assurance can be given that such security interest will be granted or perfected on a timely basis. The Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will not be required to monitor, and we may not inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Collateral, and necessary action may not be taken by us to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired Collateral. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute Collateral or monitor the perfection of or make any filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest therein or the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes against third parties. In addition, as described further herein, even if liens on Collateral acquired in the future are properly perfected, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances.

As a result of these limitations, the security interest of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of the holders of the Notes, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee in a portion of the Collateral may not be perfected or enforceable (or may be subject to other liens) under applicable law.

Thus, in any bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days of lien perfection (or potentially one year for any “insiders”) or the issuance of a guarantee, a lien given to secure, or a guarantee given to guarantee, previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the Acquisition Closing Date (or within a 30-day statutory safe harbor). Accordingly, if we or any guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the Notes are issued and, in the case of the Notes, a lien granted after such date had been perfected, or, in the case of the Notes, a guarantee issued, less than 90 days before the commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, such liens securing or guarantees guaranteeing the applicable Notes may be particularly subject to challenge and avoidance as a result of having been delivered after the date on which the applicable series of Notes were issued.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors, including the Notes Collateral Agent, are prohibited from taking various actions in furtherance of debt collection, including repossessing their security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor or any other collateral, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances and/or could be materially delayed). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents, or profits of the collateral, even if the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor with an interest in such collateral is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral at the time of the bankruptcy filing and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, as well as due to the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any relevant time thereafter or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. 97 ----- In addition, the Intercreditor Agreements will provide that so long as any obligations under the Credit Agreements are outstanding, in the event of a bankruptcy, the holders of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions with respect to their ability to object to various motions or seek other relief with respect to the Collateral on a number of important matters. In particular, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will also prohibit the holders of the Notes from proposing, voting for, or otherwise directly or indirectly supporting any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, and the holders of the Notes may under certain circumstances be required to turn over amounts and/or distributions they may receive in respect of the Current Asset Collateral to the holders of obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “—The rights of holders of the Notes in the Current Asset Collateral may be adversely affected by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement.” Also, the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement will impose limitations on the holders of the Notes with respect to their rights to object to proposed DIP financing or the use of cash collateral that has been consented to by the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and that satisfy certain terms and conditions. See “Description of Notes—Brief Description of the Notes—Security— Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” After such a bankruptcy filing, the value of the Collateral securing the Notes could materially deteriorate, and the holders of the Notes may be unable to raise various objections or take other actions. The right of the holders of the obligations under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility to foreclose upon and sell the Current Asset Collateral or of the holders of the obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to foreclose upon and sell the Fixed Asset Collateral upon the occurrence of an event of default also would be subject to limitations under applicable bankruptcy laws if we or any of our subsidiaries become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes (after taking into account all other obligations that are secured by liens that are either pari passu with or senior to the liens securing the Notes on the various components of the Collateral), the holders of the Notes would have “undersecured deficiency claims” as to the difference. Federal bankruptcy laws do not permit the payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees to the holders of “undersecured claims” (or of unsecured claims) during the debtor’s bankruptcy case. Other consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws with respect to the unsecured, deficiency portion of the Notes. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made prior to or at the time of such a finding of undercollateralization, those payments could be recharacterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the Notes. As a result, bankruptcy laws may act to limit the ability of the holders of the Notes to realize upon the Collateral and to receive post-bankruptcy interest, fees, expenses or “adequate protection” with respect to any unsecured, deficiency portion of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

The court adjudicating the Escrow Issuer’s bankruptcy or reorganization case might find that the escrowed funds are property of the Escrow Issuer’s bankruptcy estate. If it makes such a determination, the court could authorize the use of these funds by the bankruptcy estate or the bankruptcy trustee, if one is appointed, with or without restrictions, and the Trustee would be prohibited from using or disposing of these funds. Although the Escrow Issuer will grant a first-priority lien on the escrowed funds in favor of the Trustee and the holders of the applicable series of Notes, unless otherwise provided with protections in connection with such use, the holders of the Notes could become unsecured creditors of the bankruptcy estate by virtue of the Escrow Issuer utilizing the escrowed funds during the bankruptcy or reorganization case thereby dissipating the collateral of the holders of the Notes. Under applicable bankruptcy law, creditors, including the holders of the Notes while the funds are held in escrow, are prohibited from foreclosing upon or disposing of a 99 ----- debtor’s property without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). As a result, the holders of the Notes may not be able to have the escrowed funds applied at the time or in the manner contemplated by the Indenture and could suffer a loss. See “Description of Notes—Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption.” In addition, even if the bankruptcy court recognizes that the holders of Notes are secured creditors with a first-priority lien on the escrowed funds, it could nevertheless permit the use of the escrowed funds in exchange for “adequate protection” of the holders’ interest in such funds. It is not clear what adequate protection, if any, the bankruptcy court might require, but it is possible that the bankruptcy court could allow the use of the escrowed funds and provide the holders with adequate protection that may not be as valuable as the escrowed funds, such as replacement liens on different and less liquid collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

At such time and until the Escrow Release Conditions are satisfied, each series of Notes will be secured by a first-priority security interest in the applicable escrow account and the deposits and investments therein.

See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the applicable series of Notes.” The escrowed funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes, together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, if any, and will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes that may be payable in the event of a special mandatory redemption. The Ultimate Issuer or one of its affiliates will issue the Equity Commitment Letter to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Notes, to transfer to the Escrow Issuer an amount necessary to fund the payment of accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes in the event of a special mandatory redemption, plus certain fees and expenses.

Under ASC 805, all Solenis assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognized and measured at their assumed acquisition date fair value, while transaction costs and restructuring costs associated with the business combination are expensed as incurred. The excess of merger consideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is allocated to goodwill. The allocation of the purchase consideration for the Acquisition depends upon certain estimates and assumptions, all of which are preliminary. The allocation of the purchase consideration has been made for the purpose of developing the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. A final determination of fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed relating to the Acquisition could differ materially from the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration. This final valuation will be based on the actual net tangible and intangible assets of Solenis and Diversey existing at the acquisition date. Pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition is expected to close the month in which all the requisite closing conditions have been satisfied. The final valuation may materially change the allocation of the purchase consideration, which could materially affect the fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities and could result in a material change to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information. The transaction accounting adjustments represent management’s best estimates and are based upon currently available information and certain assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information presented is for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the financial position or results of operations that would have been realized if the Acquisition had been completed on the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of future operating results or financial position. We have undertaken a preliminary review of both Solenis’ and Diversey’s accounting policies and did not identify any significant adjustments that would be required to be made in order to conform the accounting policies of the companies. 114 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

The eleven month versus twelve month comparison is driven by the timing of the Solenis Acquisition which closed on November 9, 2021. _Net sales_ Net sales increased by $921.1 million to $3.91 billion for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 as compared to Net sales of $2.99 billion for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Net sales was driven by the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021. Net sales for the Sigura business during the eleven month period ending September 30, 2022 were $692.2 million. Incremental Net sales on a fully comparative basis were driven primarily by price increases to offset the impact of raw material inflation as well as increases in organically generated volume. _Cost of sales_ 134 ----- Cost of sales increased by $900.1 million to $3.02 billion for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to Cost of sales of $2.12 billion for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Cost of sales driven by the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021. Cost of sales for the Sigura business during the eleven month period ending September 30, 2021 were $463.8 million. Incremental Cost of sales on a fully comparative basis were driven primarily by raw material cost increases as well as increases in organically generated volume. _Selling, general and administrative expense_ Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $89.9 million to $611.2 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $521.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expense was driven primarily by the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021, inclusive of realized cost synergies and the related costs to realize those synergies. Incremental Selling, general and administrative expense on a fully comparative basis were driven primarily by market based compensation increases for Solenis; legacy employees. _Research and development expense_ Research and development expense increased by $3.8 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Research and development expense was driven primarily the Sigura Contribution on November 9, 2021 and the related research and development costs required to support the legacy Pools business. _Amortization of intangible assets_ Amortization of intangible assets increased by $65.0 million to $114.9 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to $49.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in the Amortization of intangible assets is primarily driven by incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the recognition of the purchase price allocations specific to the Acquisition of the heritage Solenis business and the Sigura Contribution. _Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_ Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $31.2 million to expense of $51.1 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to Acquisition and transaction related expenses of $19.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase is specific to the deal costs incurred by Solenis (as seller) and Parent (as buyer) to facilitate the closing of the Solenis Acquisition dated November 9, 2021 which includes bank success fees as well as legal and other professional service fees incurred throughout the diligence process. _Other operating expense, net_ Other operating expense, net decreased from expense of $19.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 to expense of $9.7 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. Fluctuations in Other operating expense, net were primarily related to Realized foreign exchange gains and losses related to our operations. _Non-operating (income), net_ Non-operating (income), net, increased from income of $7.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, to income of $257.3 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. Incremental Non-operating (income) was primarily driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates specific to our Euro-denominated external debt which resulted in incremental income of $224.0 million between periods. Remaining net losses incurred during the year ended September 30, 2022 driven primarily by the settlement of various monetary positions in connection with the Acquisition and Contribution primarily offset net losses incurred during the year ended September 30, 2021 driven primarily by the deconsolidation of our subsidiary in Trinidad and Tobago. _Interest expense_ Interest expense increased by $36.2 million driven primarily by incremental indebtedness utilized to finance the Acquisition and Contribution, offset by net reductions in weighted average interest rates driven primarily by fixed rate borrowings via the Secured and Unsecured Notes. 135 ----- _Income tax provision_ The income tax provision increased by $41.0 million to $66.4 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as compared to provision of $25.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Our income tax provision and effective tax rates fluctuate from period to period primarily due to changes in the mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between GAAP and local tax laws, and certain one-time items including tax rate changes, and adjustments related to the repatriation of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

The increase in Net sales was primarily driven by increases in sales volume (inclusive of acquisitions), the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and increases in pricing which increased Net sales by $106 million, $84 million and $48 million, respectively. _Cost of sales_ Cost of sales increased by $180.8 million, or 9.3%, to $2,120.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to Cost of sales of $1,939.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in Cost of sales was primarily attributable to the impact of raw material inflation, incremental sales volume (inclusive acquisitions) and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which increased Cost of sales by $66 million, $65 million and $63 million, respectively. These increases were primarily offset by changes in sales mix, which reduced Cost of sales by $16 million. _Selling, general and administrative expense_ Selling, general and administrative expense decreased by $15.7 million, or 2.9%, to $521.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to Selling, general, and administrative expense of $537.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The overall decrease in Selling, general and administrative expense was driven by permanent cost reduction programs actioned in 2020 which resulted in a net decrease in Selling, general and 136 ----- administrative expense of $41 million as well as the timing of expenses incurred for non-recurring costs which reduced Selling, general and administrative expense by $6 million. These decreases were offset by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, annual compensation cost increases and incremental incentive compensation accruals which increased Selling, general and administrative expense by $12 million, $9 million, and $8 million, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of Net sales decreased from 19.5% for the year ended September 30, 2020 to 17.4% for the year ended September 30, 2021. _Research and development expense_ Research and development expense increased by $3.3 million, or 8.1%, to $44.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $40.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. Research and development expense as a percentage of Net sales was consistent between periods, equal to 1.5% for the year ended September 30, 2021, and 1.5% for the year ended September 30, 2020. _Amortization of intangible assets_ Amortization of intangible assets increased by $1.9 million, or 4.0%, to $49.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $47.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in the Amortization of intangible assets was primarily driven by the current year impact of our prior year acquisitions for which we recognized amortizable “customer relationship” assets at each respective acquisition date. _Restructuring and severance expenses_ Restructuring and severance expenses decreased by $15.8 million, to $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to $21.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by the timing of our cost-savings initiatives related to planned reductions in force in connection with the synergy objectives for the joint venture between Solenis and BASF or in response to COVID-19. _Acquisition and transaction-related expenses_ Acquisition and transaction-related expenses increased by $17.7 million, or 791.4%, to expense of $19.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021, as compared to the Solenis Acquisition and transaction-related expenses of $2.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the timing and relative size of our various acquisitions and contemplated actions. _Other operating expense, net_ Other operating expense, net increased from $10.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2020 to $19.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Fluctuations in Other operating expense, net were primarily related to Realized foreign exchange gains and losses (including those on intercompany transactions), provisions for indirect tax contingencies, bank fees and other financial costs, and losses on abandonment or sale of property, plant and equipment.

Segment profit consists of EBITDA adjusted for (i) non-operating income or expense, (ii) the impact of certain non-cash, nonrecurring or other items that are included in net income (loss) and EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance, and (iii) certain unusual or non-recurring items impacting results in a particular period. We believe that making such adjustments provides investors with meaningful information to understand our operating results and ability to analyze financial and business trends on a period-to-period basis. We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the terms EBITDA and Segment profit may vary from that of others in our industry. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to income before income taxes, net income (loss), or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance. EBITDA and Segment profit have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: EBITDA and Segment profit: - Do not reflect the significant interest costs relative to our external debt; - Eliminate the impact of income taxes from the results of our operations; - Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Segment profit do not reflect any expenditures for such replacements; and 143 ----- - Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Segment profit differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations by using EBITDA and Segment profit along with other comparative tools, together with U.S. GAAP measurements, to assist in the evaluation of operating performance. Such U.S. GAAP measurements include income before income taxes, and net income (loss) amongst other performance metrics. In evaluating these financial measures, readers should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated in this presentation. Our presentation of EBITDA and Segment profit should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.

We further believe that these financial measures are useful financial metrics to assess our operating performance from period-to-period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business.

ASU 2016-15 requires us to evaluate the transfer of title of receivables sold under the Accounts Receivable Facility against cash received on previously-sold receivables in exchange for the transfer of title. Since there is a dichotomy between when we legally transfer title of receivables to ING Luxembourg S.A. (“ING”) or MUFG Bank, Ltd. (“MUFG”) under the ING Receivables Purchasing Agreement or MUFG Receivables Purchasing Agreement, respectively, and when the cash received on previously-sold receivables, receivables are deemed transferred in exchange for a beneficial interest in the collection of that receivable. This is considered a non-cash investing activity. Furthermore, ultimate receipts of 144 ----- cash, when settled with ING or MUFG (as relevant), are considered cash flows from investing activities, as the receipt is considered a return of capital on the beneficial interest. We believe that this may cause Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities and Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities to be potentially misleading to investors. While we do not retain legal ownership of the receivables sold, the nature, timing, and extent of cash flows have not materially changed as a result of the agreement.

This decrease was primarily driven by the net cash paid by the Olympus entities to acquire the heritage Solenis business for $4.9 billion on November 9, 2021. _Financing Activities_ Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was an inflow of $43.1 million as compared to an inflow of $5.4 billion for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022, a decrease of $5.3 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by the net financing proceeds we obtained to facilitate the Acquisition and Contribution on November 9, 2021. _Effects of Currency Rate Changes on Cash_ The effect of currency rate changes on cash for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was an unfavorable impact of $3.4 million, compared to a unfavorable impact of $1.3 million for the Successor Period ended March 31, 2022. This decrease was attributable to the relative appreciation and depreciation of the functional currencies of our global operating entities relative to the U.S. dollar and the timing of cash movements during the respective periods then ended.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from management’s expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” We are not undertaking any obligation to update any forward-looking statements or other statements we may make in the following discussion or elsewhere in this document even though these statements may be affected by events or circumstances occurring after the forward-looking statements or other statements were made. Therefore, you should not rely on these statements being current as of any time other than the date of this offering memorandum. You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the sections entitled “Basis of Presentation,” “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Pro Forma Financial Data,” “Risk Factors,” “The Transactions,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information” and the audited consolidated financial statements of Parent and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, as well as the other financial information included herein. Unless otherwise indicated, references in this section to “we,” “us,” “our,” “its” and the “Company” refer to, in the periods ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 and as of September 30, 2021, Solenis and its consolidated subsidiaries or, in the periods ended September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 and as of September 30, 2022, March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion provides a narrative of our results of operations and financial condition for the years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, and for the unaudited three and six months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022. Parent, doing business as “Solenis” from November 9, 2021, is an exempted limited partnership registered and domiciled under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Olympus and several other holding companies and partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum, all of which are organized under Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P., a Cayman exempted limited partnership (“Olympus I”) whose partners are entities affiliated with Platinum and members of the Solenis management team. Parent was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the “Successor” entity for the specific purpose of consummating Solenis Acquisition. The Solenis business was formerly owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”), BASF SE, and management. Parent also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of receiving the Sigura Contribution. The Sigura business was formerly 100% owned by affiliates of Platinum and was contributed to Parent immediately subsequent to the Solenis Acquisition on November 9, 2021. Parent was formed under a group of holding companies. Olympus I holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings II, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership (“Olympus II”). Olympus II holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings III, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership (“Olympus III”). Olympus III holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Parent. These holding companies and partnerships are collectively referred to as the “Holding Companies.” The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash, cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above. Upon the consummation of the Solenis Acquisition, Platinum acquired all of the capital stock and equity interests of the entities comprising the legacy Solenis operations from Solenis UK Holdings Limited. Economic control and legal ownership of the Solenis UK Holdings Limited and Solenis UK International Limited legal entities were retained by CD&R and had no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents prior to the Solenis Acquisition. Immediately following the Solenis Acquisition, the Sigura Contribution, which included all of Sigura’s direct and indirect subsidiaries was contributed to Olympus I, and ultimately to the Issuer by affiliates of Platinum. Accordingly, the conclusion of the Solenis Acquisition and Sigura Contribution resulted in the consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses (under the Solenis umbrella) from November 9, 2021 as presented under the “Successor” periods._ 125 ----- _On September 9, 2022, Innovative Water Care Global Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Clearon, an American producer and distributor of pool treatment chemicals serving primarily the North American market. The purpose of the acquisition was to in-source domestic production of specific intermediate materials critical to the development of our existing Pools business. Total consideration transferred at closing was $287.2 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, which includes $50 million paid into escrow for contingent consideration to be earned by the sellers based on specific manufacturing volume targets during the calendar year ending December 31, 2023. Based upon an assessment of the facts and circumstances, an assessment of the likelihood of achievement and present value considerations, the estimated fair value of the expected cash to be returned from escrow to Solenis at the end of the earnout period is $48.6 million as of the date these financial statements are available to be issued. This $48.6 million has been recorded as a contingent non-current asset and is presented within Other assets (long- term) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2023.

The war between the two countries continues to evolve as military activity proceeds and additional economic sanctions are imposed on Russia by numerous countries throughout the world. In addition to the human toll and impact of the war locally in Russia, Ukraine, and neighboring countries that conduct business with their counterparties, the war is increasingly affecting economic and global financial markets and exacerbating ongoing economic challenges, including issues such as rising inflation and global supply-chain disruption. The Russia-Ukraine war has exacerbated the current inflationary environment both in Russia, as a result of economic sanctions that devalue its currency, and in other countries as their businesses and currencies react to the war’s implications worldwide. It is possible that foreign currency restrictions or the development of multiple exchange rates could arise in certain countries. In addition, if there are inflationary pressures in Russia and the neighboring countries, we may be required to assess whether the economies of those countries have become highly inflationary, in which the U.S. dollar would replace the Russian ruble as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Russia.

As economies around the world reopened, increases in demand created significant disruptions to the global supply chain during 2022, which affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs. These supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, industry capacity constraints, raw material shortages and labor shortages. Global logistics network challenges have resulted in delays, shortages of certain materials, and increased transportation costs. We have materially mitigated to date the impact of these disruptions through the work of our procurement and supply chain teams, but there continues to be significant uncertainties regarding the future impact of supply chain disruptions, which we cannot predict. Additionally, we continue the process of consolidating certain facilities within North America, which includes opening a new manufacturing and warehousing facility, which have presented short-term operational challenges and supply chain disruptions. We are a diversified business in regards to both industry segments and global geographic regions. These different aspects of our business are each impacted differently by supply chain disruptions and broader economic conditions.

We experienced unprecedented inflation in 2022, which impacted the cost of our raw materials, packaging and transportation. Cost estimates for our restructuring project in North America and Europe have also been impacted by the inflationary macro environment with constraints around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary short-term measures were taken to minimize disruption to customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily setting up additional warehouses, paying higher freight costs during warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery. Inflation declined slightly in the first quarter of 2023, but continues to be well above historical levels. We are committed to maintaining our margins, and have taken actions to mitigate inflation through price increases, cost control, raw material substitutions, and more efficient logistics practices. However, our success is dependent on competitive pressures and market conditions, and we cannot guarantee the negative impacts of inflation can be fully recovered. In periods of significant inflation, we may experience a lag between our ability to recover both the cost and margin in the short term. 149 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Our international operations are subject to changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures. We present the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements in U.S. dollars. As a result, we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all of our operations into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar may affect the value of these items with respect to our non-U.S. dollar businesses in the Diversey Consolidated Financial Statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency. A stronger U.S. dollar reduces the relative value of reported results of non-U.S. dollar operations, and, conversely, a weaker U.S. dollar increases the relative value of the non-U.S. dollar operations. These translations could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and/or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets, liabilities and stockholders’ equity. During 2022, the U.S. dollar significantly strengthened against the Euro and other European currencies, peaking in the third quarter. The U.S. dollar has since trended weaker, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our reported results in the first quarter of 2023. In addition, many of our operations buy materials and incur expenses in a currency other than their functional currency. As a result, our results of operations are impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations because we are generally unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with expenses incurred in the same currency. From time to time, as and when we determine it is appropriate and advisable to do so, we may seek to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. 150 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

In addition, Non-GAAP measures are used by management to review and analyze our operating performance and, along with other data, as internal measures for setting annual budgets and forecasts, assessing financial performance, providing guidance and comparing our financial performance with our peers. Non-GAAP financial measures also provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the core operating results and trends in our ongoing business by eliminating certain expenses and/or gains (which may not occur in each period presented) and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of our ongoing business with prior periods and peers more difficult, obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management’s ability to make useful forecasts.

Our calculation of these Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation.

Diversey EBITDA consists of net income (loss) before income tax provisions (benefit), interest expense, interest income, depreciation and amortization. Diversey Adjusted EBITDA consists of Diversey EBITDA adjusted to (i) eliminate certain non-operating income or expense items, (ii) eliminate the impact of certain non-cash and other items that are included in net income and Diversey EBITDA that we do not consider indicative of our 160 ----- ongoing operating performance, and (iii) eliminate certain unusual and non-recurring items impacting results in a particular period. Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to revenues, net income (loss), income (loss) before income tax provision or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, nor should they be considered as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our method of calculating Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA may vary from the methods used by other companies. We consider Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA to be key indicators of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.

Our presentation of Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA have important limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. The use of Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA instead of net income has limitations as an analytical tool, including the following: - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our income taxes; - Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and - Other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. Diversey Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments that represent a cash expense or that represent a non-cash charge that may relate to a future cash expense, and some of these expenses are of a type that we expect to incur in the future, although we cannot predict the amount of any such future charge. Because of these limitations, Diversey EBITDA and Diversey Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a replacement for net income or as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to service our indebtedness or invest in our business.

However, Adjusted Net Income is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute or alternative for financial information presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted Net Income has limitations as an analytical tool; some of these limitations are: - Adjusted Net Income does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted Net differently, which reduce their usefulness as comparative measures; and - in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in our calculation of Adjusted Net Income and our presentation of Adjusted Net Income should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by the types of items excluded from the calculation of Adjusted Net Income.

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a five-step model consisting of the following: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. Performance obligations are satisfied when we transfer control of a good or service to a customer, which can occur over time or at a point in time. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, including the expected value of variable consideration. The customer’s ability and intent to pay the transaction price is assessed in determining whether a contract exists with the customer. If collectability of substantially all of the consideration in a contract is not probable, consideration received is not recognized as revenue unless the consideration is 165 ----- nonrefundable and we no longer have an obligation to transfer additional goods or services to the customer or collectability becomes probable. Product sales, to end-customers or distributors, represents approximately 98% of our revenue and is recognized at a point-in-time, which is generally at the point in time when products have been shipped, right to payment has been obtained and risk of loss has been transferred. Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled based on customer contracts. For sales to distributors, revenue is adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including but not limited to estimated discounts and distributor rebate programs. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Fair value determination is subject to a significant degree of estimates. The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessments of factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition. Where appropriate, external advisors are consulted to assist in the determination of fair value. For non-observable market values, fair value has been determined using acceptable valuation principles (e.g., multiple excess earnings, relief from royalty and cost methods) which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value.

Such longlived assets primarily consist of definite-lived intangible assets in an aggregate amount of $1,165.9 million and $1,292.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We perform an impairment review for definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Such events may include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, change in manner in which an asset is being used, significant change in business climate and significant cash flow or operating losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of the asset. We calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying value of the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount is found to be greater than the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows of the asset or asset group, we record an impairment loss of the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset or asset group. In addition, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate. Definite-lived intangible assets, such as trade names and customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives. The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the balance sheet. We evaluate these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Our goodwill had a carrying value of $462.8 million and $471.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 166 ----- 2021, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Diversey trade name, had a carrying value of $818.2 million and $854.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We review goodwill for possible impairment on a reporting unit level, which are consistent with our operating segments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on an annual basis as of October 1st of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. Such events may include, but are not limited to, impairment of other assets or establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, cash flow or operating losses at a reporting unit, negative current events or long-term outlooks for our industry, and negative adjustments to future forecasts. In performing the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have the option under U.S. GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment that there are no indicators of impairment, we do not perform a quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of October 1. U.S. GAAP provides a set of qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry, market and company specific factors, including cost factors, overall financial performance, market capitalization, and other events specific to Diversey to consider in performing the qualitative assessment described above, which factors are not all inclusive; management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments. If we conclude from our qualitative assessment that there are indicators of impairment and that a quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount of the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time we change our operating segments. If the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly-formed reporting units, the allocation is made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values. Based on the results of our 2022 and 2021 annual qualitative assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value. As such, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that our reporting units were not impaired. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using both an income approach, which is based on discounted cash flows (“DCF”), and a market approach when we quantitatively test goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 of each year. Significant judgments inherent in using a DCF analysis include the selection of appropriate discount and long-term growth rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on our most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates and growth rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit’s current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors, and reflect our best estimate as of the impairment testing date. Any changes in such assumptions or estimates as a result of changes in our budgets, forecasts or negative macroeconomic trends could significantly affect the value of our reporting units which could impact whether an impairment of goodwill has occurred. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. The 2022 and 2021 annual assessments of the indefinite-lived intangible asset did not identify any impairments. 167 ----- When performing a quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset using a relief from royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license our trade names. The future cash flows are based on our most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted revenue growth rates. Assumptions used in the relief from royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in our annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment was 9.5% in 2022, and the royalty rate used in 2022 was 3.0%. Based on the results of our 2021 annual qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded the carrying value. As such, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that the indefinite-lived intangible asset was not impaired. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible asset involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, or other factors could negatively affect the fair value of our reporting units or the indefinite-lived intangible asset and result in a material impairment charge in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. Where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings of foreign subsidiaries, we provide for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings. We recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized.

In addition, we implemented a replacement retiree health care reimbursement plan for certain U.S. employees. The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a plan-by-plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset 168 ----- allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Diversey generated Net sales of $2.8 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, and Adjusted EBITDA of $330 million, $410 million and $401 million, respectively. See “Summary—Summary Historical Financial and Combined Financial Data.” In addition, for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, Diversey spent $56 million, $60 million, $55 million and $41 million, respectively, on capital expenditure.

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1067,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF DIVERSEY,1067.43,BUSINESS Company Overview,1067.43.4,Combined Company,"We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will create a platform with a shared commercial focus and significant global scale in complementary end markets. After giving effect to the Transactions, the combined company will be able to grow and provide a number of attractive cross-selling opportunities, including meeting customers’ increasing demand for “one-stop shop” service models across water management, cleaning and hygiene solutions. After giving effect to the Transactions, we expect to be better positioned to benefit from growing Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) and macroeconomic trends, including those around customer sustainability goals and focus points, such as: heightened focus on water consumption and recycling; the need for improved energy efficiency and raw material management; increased consumer focus on hygiene; increased environmental legislation being implemented globally; and increased levels of shipping and packaging. Together, we will offer a diverse, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, which will limit any obsolescence risk as no product or solution represents a material part of our business. Solenis’ and Diversey’s combined segment, geographic and end market breakdown by revenue for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 is illustrated below.[(1) ] (2) Totals may not equal 100% due to rounding. Our leading technology has been at the forefront of the digitization of the water treatment industry and we have a strong pipeline of new and innovative products that we expect will drive significant value for our customers. 171 ----- The combination of Solenis and Diversey represents the coming together of two leading global products, services, and technologies providers with proven track records of product innovation who offer truly differentiated solutions to customers. Prior to the Transactions, we already operate across a diverse set of growing end markets and our broad geographic reach allows us to meet the needs of our customers globally. After giving effect to the Transactions, our combined footprint will continue to span six continents, with reinforced strength and scale of presence, with an increased number of laboratories and production facilities across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC, where we serve all major developed markets and are closely integrated with our customers throughout the world. After giving effect to the Transactions, through our global presence and differentiated service offering in growing markets, we believe we will be a leading provider in all of our segments and will continue to benefit from positive secular trends such as e-commerce for customers, an increased demand for sustainable packaging, a focus on ESG and incremental disposable income increases in emerging markets. The following graphic summarizes the geographic reach of laboratories and production facilities of the combined Solenis company following the Transactions. After giving effect to the Transactions, we will operate 70 manufacturing facilities and 18 laboratories in 23 countries. (1) Includes research, customer application, and development sites. (2) Pro forma for Project Mega facility and associated plant consolidations. See “—Growth Strategy.” There is limited existing overlap between Solenis’ and Diversey’s offerings in water treatment chemicals with legacy Solenis operating in the water treatment and pool solutions markets and legacy Diversey operating in the food and beverage and institutional end markets. We believe the combined company platform will be able to “circle the customer” and create opportunities for new business wins, increasing our customer spending. For example in hotels today, Solenis has a limited presence in pool solutions while Diversey provides kitchen care, building care, floor care, infection prevention and laundry care. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe the fact that Solenis and Diversey provide different services to their combined customers will provide the combined company with the opportunity to offer existing hotel customers our full suite of products and services, including water treatment. Similarly, Solenis does not currently serve cruise ships or hospitals but will have the opportunity to offer its services to Diversey’s customers in these markets. Protein processing plants are another customer type that each of Solenis and Diversey have a moderate presence with, and going forward, a combined company platform may enable both companies to expand their offerings with such customers. We believe the Transactions present the opportunity to combine our existing services into a “one-stop shop” provider across water management, cleaning 172 ----- and hygiene solutions for our customers. The following graphic summarizes the potential cross-selling opportunities for the combined company. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be able to implement near-term strategic initiatives in the legacy Diversey to better optimize processes, drive growth and create value. Some key initiatives will include (i) increasing scale by bundling our leading global cleaning and water treatment solutions across Industrial and Food & Beverage to increase win rates and cross-selling opportunities, (ii) increasing efficiencies by standardizing corporate functions, (iii) implementing a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, (iv) investing in growth opportunities such as expansion efforts within: North America commercial and institutional, high growth global strategic accounts (“GSAs”), distributor partnerships and building out new product introduction (NPI) capabilities and (v) applying our performance management capabilities to existing processes. We believe by creating real-time visibility into financial performance we will be able to drive accountability at a more localized level and assist in informing business decisions (such as pricing and have better insight into profitability and distributors’ sell-through). We believe we will be able to further supplement our efforts by deploying commercial excellence tools such as roll-outs and trainings. Additionally, we believe we can continue implementing Diversey’s “Project Mega” by continuing to develop Diversey’s manufacturing and warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky alongside consolidating certain existing service centers to provide manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities. We believe our business exhibits highly attractive financial characteristics, including significant recurring revenues, improving margin profile and substantial free cash flow conversion. The combined company will provide greater scale, a broader global reach, superior customer service capabilities and a number of attractive cross-selling opportunities. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, we generated pro forma Net sales on a combined historical basis and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies) of $7.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, inclusive of $205 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions expected to be taken within 24 months after the Acquisition and $40 million of cumulative run-rate annual cost synergies from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and $13 million of estimated run-rate annual cost synergies from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24 months of the Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. We believe our combined earnings profile after giving effect to the Transactions will generate significant free cash flow, which we expect will be used to support growth initiatives and drive de-leveraging. We believe that the Transactions create an opportunity to realize meaningful synergies resulting from the integration of Solenis and Diversey. In combining these two complementary businesses, we believe the combined company is entering a new and exciting chapter in a long history of helping customers address core challenges such as water and energy management, partnering on sustainability issues to work towards a cleaner, safer world, and reducing environmental impacts. We expect to realize approximately $205 million of synergies from integration related to the consolidation of support functions and sales teams, the consolidation of sourcing of direct materials, and the consolidation of facilities between the two businesses, as a result of actions expected to be taken within 24 months of the closing of the Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve such synergies. For more information on anticipated synergies, including certain factors that may impact our ability to 173 ----- achieve such synergies or operational improvements, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition and the Legacy Acquisitions—We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits from the items reflected in the adjustments included in Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega), Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Legacy Acquisitions, Related Synergies and Project Mega) and Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA (After the Acquisition and Related Synergies).” The prospective unaudited financial information contained in this offering memorandum was not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the SEC or the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation or presentation of prospective financial information.

The water treatment process begins with testing; specifically pool pH and chlorine levels on a weekly basis. The next step is balancing, i.e., maintaining certain levels of pH, total alkalinity and calcium hardness. Sanitizing, which is keeping water clean and disinfected, is most frequently done using stabilized chlorine products. Specialty maintenance products such as algaecides and clarifiers are typically used on a semimonthly basis, in addition to the normal sanitizing process, to target specific pool needs such as algae prevention or stain control. Lastly, shock treatment can be used to address one-off pool care needs, especially following inclement weather and high pool usage. We are a leading producer of pool chemicals for the residential and commercial markets worldwide and provide various water treatment products including shock, sanitizer, specialty maintenance products, and test strips. Our offerings include a full suite of products and applications aimed at public pools, health clubs, aquatic parks, hotels, motels, apartments and condominiums in the form of water-soluble pods, convenient floaters and automatic feeders. Our portfolio of brands includes iconic brands such HTH®, Poolife®, GLB®, Leisure Time® and HTH Spa®. We believe we are the world’s largest producer of calcium-hypoclorite (“cal-hypo”), a primary chemical used in water treatment and sanitation. We believe we are one of only two players with a complete brand and product offering in the U.S. pool and spa chemicals market and we believe we are the only player with a truly global offering.

Demand for products from the Pool Solutions segment is driven by the existing installed base of pools in the regions it operates, which have seen growth tailwinds due to COVID-driven investment in outdoor spaces. Going forward, ongoing maintenance of these pools will drive sustainable and recurring future demand for our products.

Our customer base for the combined company includes many of the top paper and industrial players across our Industrial Solutions and Consumer Solutions segments, including WestRock, International Paper, and Marathon Petroleum, across big-box retailers such as Wal-Mart and Leslie’s Poolmart in our Pool Solutions segment, across Compass, ISS and McDonald’s in our Institutional Solutions segment and across PepsiCo and Nestle in our Food & Beverage segment. We believe that the combination of Solenis and Diversey will further reduce customer concentration. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, the top ten customers for the combined company represent approximately 12% of total pro forma combined company Net sales with the largest customer representing approximately 2% of pro forma combined company Net sales. As of March 31, 2023, at Solenis, the top ten customers represented approximately 19% of total Net sales with the top three customers representing approximately 11%. Historically, large accounts have grown 1.3x faster than the base business, driven by collaboration with customers on new technology development, embedded service engineers and focus on consistent delivery and service. As of March 31, 2023 at Diversey, customer concentration was relatively in line with that of Solenis so low customer concentration is set to become even less concentrated as a result of the combination of Solenis and Diversey. Further, Diversey is a major global player with capabilities to serve GSAs, which represents approximately 20% of revenue. Both Solenis and Diversey have long-tenured, diverse and high quality customer relationships. We believe our customer base is inherently sticky, attributable to the mission critical nature and service-led models that Solenis and Diversey provide, leading to highly recurring, non-discretionary spend on products and services. On-site technicians, employees and equipment at customer locations create high switching costs and disruption risk. As a result, we believe Solenis’ Net sales is approximately 97% recurring, driven by our differentiated solutions and value proposition and will continue to remain over 97% recurring in the combined company. _Suppliers & Procurement_ We source materials from multiple suppliers creating low supply chain concentration. On April 30, 2021, Solenis and BASF agreed to extend the supply agreements applicable to certain products that are critical to Solenis’ supply chain and for which Solenis takes all of BASF’s production, which now will not expire until November 2028. Our largest raw material spend includes General Liquids (5.4% of total spend), Caustic and Chlorine (3.3% of total spend), Acrylonitrile (2.9% of total spend), HDPE (2.2% of total spend) and Sodium Hydroxide (2.1% of total spend) resulting in a top five materials of 15.9% or $590 million.

Based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021, the global Consumer market was estimated to be approximately $8 billion in 2020. The Packaging market is one of the key market segments within the Consumer market that can be broken into consumer packaging and food packaging. Based on the same report, the Consumer packaging market was estimated to be $2.7 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 3.4% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030, which we believe will be driven primarily from the growth of e-commerce and megatrends in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics and beauty. Approximately 10% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the consumer packaging market. Based on the same report, the food packaging market was estimated to be $1.8 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 1.9% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030 (including food packaging barrier film expected to grow at a 4.7% CAGR), driven by increased demand for ecofriendly packaging and changing lifestyles centering on more take-away and individually packed food. We believe the shift away from plastic and the growth in the barrier coating market, which is not included in the market size estimate, may drive additional growth in food packaging over this period. Approximately 7% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the food packaging and molded fiber packaging market. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market has been adversely impacted by the continued substitution of printed material with electronic media. Reduced use of commercial office spaces in Europe and North America as a result of COVID-19 is also a negative factor for the sector outlook. The Graphic & Specialty Paper market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.9 billion in 2020 and is expected to decline at a 0.9% CAGR for the ten-year period from 2020 to 2030. However, we have limited exposure to newsprint, which accounts for approximately 2.5% of Consumer Solutions sales, and we are shifting our focus to higher margin products to offset the expected volume decline in this market. Approximately 5% of our pro forma Net sales for the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 was generated from the Graphic & Specialty Paper market. The Tissue & Towel market is benefiting from strong demographic/socioeconomic trends and increasing hygiene standards, especially in developing markets. However, stagnating population growth in some mature markets, and cost-cutting in the public sector and private company spending is expected to limit global market growth. The Tissue & Towel market, based on the same report, was estimated to be $1.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 2.6% CAGR for the ten-year period 2020 to 2030.

Broadly speaking, the industrial market 184 ----- consists of core water treatment which includes end markets such as pulp, mining and oil and gas, and wastewater, which includes end markets such as municipal and industrial wastewater markets. Based on the same report, the global industrial market was estimated to be approximately $23 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a 4.0% CAGR for the five-year period 2020 to 2025 for both the wastewater and core water treatment markets. The municipal market is expected to grow at a 4.3% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report, as demand continues to increase from higher per capita usage of water, population growth and increasing regulatory demands. Growth in the core water treatment market, including both heavy and light industrial markets, is expected to be driven by increasing sustainability and environmental policies, growing regulatory demands and global industrial growth. This growth is expected to be highest in the food and beverage market (5.5% CAGR for the five year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report) and the refining and petrochemicals market (4.0% CAGR for the five-year period from 2020 to 2025, based on the same report).

Our main focus is on the Chemicals segment which is the largest and most stable component of aftermarket pool spend. Pool chemicals sales are tied to: (1) the pool installed base and (2) total gallons of treatable water, and not new builds. The U.S. pool installed base has displayed long-term stability as it has consistently grown for decades, including all years through the housing-led recession and during the COVID-19 pandemic period, which is providing current tailwinds for the business. As of December 31, 2022, the installed base of U.S. in ground pools was 9 million, based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. However, new builds account for less than 4% of the installed base annually, meaning that new build rates are unlikely to materially impact our long-term performance. The Pool Solutions segment also benefits from a stable aftermarket spend that mirrors the steady dynamic of the installed base. Our chemical-based products result in 100% aftermarket exposure, which reduces our exposure to cyclical industry trends such as housing starts. Pool chemical use is entirely non-discretionary in that it is a requirement for owning and using a pool. Pool owners who have already made the significant upfront investment of constructing a pool, estimated to cost $40,000 to $100,000, will continue to purchase pool chemicals, at the de minimis annual expense of $300 to $400 in order to maintain their pools. The pool chemical treatment market includes products such as primary sanitizers (71% of total market sales), specialty chemicals, other shocks and alternative sanitizers. Primary sanitizers include cal-hypo, sodium hypochlorite (“sodium-hypo”), trichlor, dichlor and packaged shocks. The total market for U.S. residential pool chemicals, based on retail dollar value, was approximately $2.6 billion in 2020 and grew by 28% in 2021 to approximately $3.4 billion, primarily due to higher prices resulting from scarcity of chlorine based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We believe the U.S. residential pool chemical market, on a volume basis, will exceed the expected growth of the installed base of U.S. residential pools, which was estimated to be 3.0% from 2020 to 2025 based on a recent study by a leading research firm in the pool and spa market. We further believe that volumes in our pool solutions segment will exceed the market as we expand our customer base and increase market sale with new dealer relationships and e-commerce.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Based on the same report, we believe that we maintain market leadership positions in almost all technologies and regions. The competitive landscape, as segmented by geography or technology, remains fragmented. We have particularly strong market positions in 187  Recovering economy post-COVID  Increasing global population driving growth and increased free disposable income in Food & Beverage 6.5% $14.3 12% developing countries  Growing interest in green cleaning products and dosage / packaging solutions that streamline cleaning process costs ----- process chemicals within the biocide, contaminant control, defoamer, tissue specialties and pulp specialties technologies. Our strength is based on the complete product portfolio, premium product performance and strong technical support we offer. We believe we have the best and the broadest offering to help customers achieve their operational efficiencies. We are a trusted supplier known for our data analytics capacities, with a focus on service excellence, sustainability, productivity and cost savings for our customers. Many customers are starting to embrace digital technology / data analytics to help track performance and starting to partner with suppliers with strong R&D capabilities to develop innovative solutions to drive efficiency and achieve sustainability objectives. This trend is expected to continue and we expect to benefit from it due to our robust value-added chemistry and technology solutions offering. _Industrial Solutions_ The global industrial water chemicals market is fragmented, with the top seven players, based on a report by a third-party expert advisor completed in June 2021. This is due to the required application-specific expertise and track-record of performance. Hence, by region and by end-user market, three to five players may have a disproportionately high share. We believe we have an outsized share of the global pulp and paper market, which is one of our larger markets within the Industrial Solutions segment. We believe we offer the lowest per unit cost for comparable chemicals compared to our industry peers and believe that the competitive pricing is our greatest strength in the Industrial Solutions segment. Additionally, we offer an array of innovative solutions and comprehensive product lines both in core water treatment and wastewater segment. Notable competitors include Ecolab / Nalco, Suez, ChemTreat, Kurita, Kemira and SNF. Ecolab, which acquired Nalco in 2011, is the largest water treatment player followed by Suez. Similar to the Consumer market, technology and R&D are becoming increasingly important beyond the chemical product itself as customers are moving towards advanced analytics to optimize the volume of chemical treatment, driving select industry participants to increasingly focus on equipment / engineering solutions as opposed to chemical solutions. _Pool Solutions_ We believe we are the only true global player in the Pool Solutions segment with leading market positions in North America, South America, and EMEA. We believe the acquisition of Clearon further enhanced our market leading position. Our primary competitor in this segment is KIK Custom Products, which provides various pool chemical solutions, with a focus on North America. Other smaller competitors also compete in this market, with varying breadth and geographical focus, including Hasa Pool, Jandy, Lo-chlor and Jack’s Magic. We believe we are the world’s largest producer of cal-hypo, a primary chemical used in water treatment and sanitation. All three of our cal-hypo facilities are co-located with chlor-alkali producers meaning that raw materials (chlorine and caustic soda) are delivered into our production plants via a direct pipeline. We believe this is a major competitive advantage and barrier to entry in the Pool Solutions segment as we believe it would not be economical for our competitors to open a new cal-hypo facility that is not co-located with a supply of raw materials. The acquisition of Clearon provided additional manufacturing capabilities for trichlor and dichlor and we are now the only producer of cal-hypo, trichlor and dichlor, which we believe will give us a significant advantage over our competitors. Further, Clearon’s manufacturing facility located in West Virginia was isolated from the impact of natural disasters that other competitors have experienced with facilities located on the Gulf Coast. _Institutional Solutions_ Diversey is a major global player in the Institutional Solutions segment and competes primarily with Ecolab. Other competitors in this segment include: SC Johnson, Gojo, Kalykim and Jasol. In this highly fragmented market, Diversey and Ecolab together hold approximately a 20% global market share. Geographically, Diversey believes it is the number one or number two player in the North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific regions. Other competitors are focused on niche segments and geographies, focusing on regional and local customers. 188 ----- Diversey is positioned to compete using a recurring revenue business model built on consumable products that require periodic replacement and high customer switching costs via a suite of proprietary dosing and dispensing equipment installed at customer sites. Further, to better compete with Ecolab in North America, Diversey is in the process of opening a new co-manufacturing / co-warehouse facility in Northern Kentucky, alongside consolidating certain existing service centers to increase manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities. After giving effect to the Transactions, we believe that we will be better positioned to compete with Ecolab for leadership across all markets. We believe that the combined company is best positioned to capture share on a global scale due to Diversey’s strong existing market position, combined with our own position and track record of sustained growth and the white space afforded by such a fragmented market. _Food & Beverage_ Diversey is one of the only two global players in the Food & Beverage segment and competes primarily with Ecolab. The Food & Beverage market is largely consolidated and Diversey and Ecolab together hold approximately half of the global market share. Ecolab and Diversey generally compete within cleaning and hygiene solutions. Other, smaller competitors exist including Zep, Reckitt and Kersia. These players tend to service more regional markets and operate with highly limited product and distribution capabilities. Prior to the Transactions, we entered into a distribution relationship with Diversey through which we provide water treatment products to be marketed to Diversey’s existing customer base within its Food & Beverage segment. This current offering sets Diversey apart from Ecolab and represents an opportunity for additional market capture and cross-selling in the future following the consummation of the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Increased focus on sustainability and ESG is a key trend across both Consumer Solutions and Industrial Solutions segments and is driving demand as our customers aim to reduce water and energy consumption, optimize raw materials spend and reduce waste emission. These objectives require increased chemical use which is driving increased demand for our business. Institutional products are designed to enhance cleanliness, safety, environmental sustainability, and efficiency needed to serve our customers in the healthcare, education, food service, retail and grocery, hospitality, and building service contractor industries. Food & Beverage solutions will maximize food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability for our customers in the brewing, beverage, dairy, processed foods, pharmaceutical and agriculture industries. At the micro level, we provide solutions to customers with specific sustainability goals. For example, our offering of PFAS-free oil and grease resistant technology has been selected by major brand owners as a replacement in food service bowls. We also made a series of recommendations to a chemical company which resulted in a reduction of 28,000 cubic meters of water per year and 3,000 tons of CO2 emissions. The resulting savings for our customer were approximately $27 million per year. Further, our cal-hypo-based shocks that are sold at big-box retailers eliminate the need to drain and refill pools due to over stabilization, resulting in potential water savings of up to 600 gallons per pound used instead of dichlor and we estimate approximate water savings of up to 25 billion gallons per year. Diversey’s Clax® Advanced laundry solution supports clean and bright laundry at low wash temperatures to lower operational costs and reduce its customers’ environmental impact.

Through Solenis’ value-documentation program, sales teams have accountability requirements to show that at least 5% of Net sales deliver a value advantage to customers, which enables price capture even in deflationary environments. This has enabled us to pass through a majority of increases in raw chemical materials, which are one of the major drivers for cost inflation, to customers by adjusting prices accordingly. We began to see a significant increase in the price of our raw materials, including ethylene and propylene, during the twelve months ended March 31, 2023 and we began to pass on price increases to our customers. Typically, we experience an approximately 90-day lag in implementing our price increases, however, during the six months ended March 31, 2023, we exceeded our goals and were able to drive price increases even faster with price exceeding cost during the six months ended March 31, 2023 in all of our business segments. While Diversey continues to adjust prices to pass through increases in raw materials costs, Diversey was slower to react to the inflationary cost environment than Solenis, which resulted in more pronounced margin compression throughout 2022 than Solenis. Once combined, Diversey’s performance is expected to improve as they will operate on Solenis’ value-documentation program.

Our expansion efforts will eliminate existing capacity constraints and better position us to capitalize on customer demand for these high-margin products. Our engineering estimates for all facilities are underway with expansion efforts expected to be online in 2026. We expect the PVAM and cal-hypo expansions to cost $150 million and $100 million, respectively. A majority of our customers, especially those producing packaging and tissue and towel products, are focused on improving strength. We are a market leader in strength chemistry, with the broadest portfolio of synthetic strength additives like PVAM and are the leading supplier of global PVAM production. Previously PVAM was originally sold by BASF and we acquired full commercial rights as part of 2019 merger. However, in advance of the merger, BASF raised prices substantially, resulting in lost sales. Post integration, we refilled the pipeline and returned the product to growth, however, in recent years, our PVAM volumes have been constrained despite debottlenecking programs implemented and we have been unable to return to pre-BASF merger levels. Further, in fiscal year 2022, we experienced shutdowns and product issues resulting in production allocation and customer management challenges. To solve our capacity constraint, we are looking to build incremental capacity at our existing Suffolk, Virginia facility, which is expected to be online by the end of 2026 that will enable us to increase capacity by approximately 100%. Cal-hypo is a highly concentrated source of chlorine in solid form and is a cost-effective solution primarily used for pool sanitization and maintenance with secondary uses to disinfect water in industrial and municipal markets. Our Solenis HTH[ TM] and Poolife[TM] offerings are cal-hypo-based shocks that eliminate the need to drain and refill pools due to over stabilization with other benefits including minimized storage requirements, dry formulation for shelf stability and easy handling, reduced shipping and handling costs and reduced maintenance. We are currently experiencing capacity constraints at our Kempton Park, South Africa facility. Further, given over 50% of global supply is produced in either China or India, importing incremental capacity is both challenging and costly. Due to these constraints, we are looking to expand our capacity. Expansion efforts at our Kempton Park facility are underway and are expected to be completed by fiscal year ended 2023 or 2024. Further, we are pursuing a site selection process for additional capacity including assessing potential new locations, with the expectation that all facilities will be online by 2026. In the interim, we will look to temporarily source incremental capacity via third parties to pre-seed the plant which we believe will drive top line growth in the near team and insourcing savings in the future. Following its return to the United States market, Diversey’s current management team identified potential 197 ----- manufacturing and logistical efficiencies and insourcing opportunities by re-positioning and consolidating certain existing service centers. This supply chain improvement process is referred to as “Project Mega.” Project Mega includes a largely complete consolidation of the North American supply chain footprint through the creation of a manufacturing plant and co-located warehouse in Northern Kentucky, as well as warehouse consolidation in Europe. Diversey started shipping from the new Kentucky warehouse in July 2022 and is consolidating its manufacturing capabilities into the same Kentucky facility. Further, Project Mega is consolidating five Diversey (three Institutional and two Food & Beverage) plants into four plants (two Institutional and two Food & Beverage) and is planning on closing two Wisconsin plants. By co-locating its main warehouse and manufacturing capabilities, and adding more capacity to bring currently contracted volumes in-house and optimizing freight lanes, the project is expected to drive approximately $30 million of annual cost savings. The run rate cost savings includes $11 million related to manufacturing efficiencies from increased insourcing from contract manufacturers, more efficient lines and fixed absorption, co-location of liquid manufacturing and wipes conversion and an optimized flow of processes, $10 million related to logistics and the ability to avoid shipping between sites along with having new sites closer to suppliers and customers, $7 million related to direct savings achieved from materials sourcing using larger orders (i.e. from drums to bulk orders), $1 million related to warehousing from lower rent and co-locating with manufacturing and $2 million related to other.

Additionally, we achieved $40 million of cost synergies related to the Solenis Acquisition from actions that were taken within 18 months of the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and we identified $13 million of cost synergies related to the Clearon Acquisition which are expected to be realized from actions already taken or expected to be taken within 24 months of the Clearon Acquisition Closing Date. As of March 31, 2023, we have realized $6.5 million of cost synergies related to the Clearon Acquisition. We are also well positioned to continue to grow through acquisitions via multiple M&A avenues. We have a proven track record as an M&A platform, with 17 transactions completed since 2014, including the transformative fiscal year 2019 merger with BASF’s water and paper business and the Solenis Acquisition in fiscal year 2022. We believe there is an opportunity for both strategic bolt-ons and transformational targets going forward.

As a leader in sustainability, Solenis has been helping its customers tackle these complex challenges for more than 100 years. Global trends show that sustainability strategies are becoming strong differentiators for businesses and that stakeholders are increasingly interested in how key ESG issues are managed. ESG covers a broad set of issues, from the carbon dioxide footprint to labor practices to corruption. Consumers and employees are demanding higher standards of sustainability and quality of employment. Regulators and policy-makers are also interested in sustainability, and they see the corporate sector as a key player in the journey toward achieving sustainable development. One of the most relevant environmental issues for the chemical industry is the management of water resources. As freshwater sources like rivers or lake become increasingly stressed, the chemical industry is working with other sectors to increase water efficiency and to reduce water use in their operations and value chain. Businesses are also investing in recycling technologies, as well as incorporating renewable and recyclable materials in their product portfolio. With a water treatment heritage of more than a century, helping customers meet their environmental goals has always been one of the company’s highest priorities. In 2020, with a view to advancing our sustainability goals and commitments, we carried out a materiality assessment to identify the most material topics to stakeholders and the business. The aim was to identify ways to enhance the company’s existing sustainability efforts, improve transparency and disclosure, look for more opportunities to drive sustainable solutions and improve operational efficiency and productivity. Although involved in numerous sustainability initiatives for many years, the materiality assessment helped to inform the development of the company’s strategic sustainability approach going forward, organizing its actions and commitments across four focus areas:",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1067,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF DIVERSEY,1067.70,Impact of COVID-19,1067.70.1,,"Although the COVID-19 pandemic presented us with many hurdles to overcome, we achieved considerable business successes through our business agility and creative approaches to solving customer problems. During the pandemic, the business remained strong, owing to the essential markets we serve, which include consumer packaging, tissue and towel, municipal and many other essential goods producers. These customers have ongoing needs for products and services to protect water and production assets. For consumer-related manufacturing, such as bath tissue and packaging for e-commerce, our customers increased production significantly in response to demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. In addition, COVID-19 has accelerated and driven many trends and changing behaviors globally, one of which is the concept of “cocooning.” This has resulted in a greater focus on the home environment, which has translated into increased residential pool builds in the North American and European geographies. Additionally, greater focus on home entertainment and health has increased residential pool usage and maintenance, which has positively impacted the demand for pool chemicals. A downside experienced from COVID-19 is the reduction in tourism and travel, which has resulted in a negative impact on commercial pool usage and resulted in decreased chemical usage in commercial pools. Overall, we believe that the positive impact on residential pools chemical usage during the COVID-19 pandemic has outweighed the negative impact to the commercial pools chemicals usage. We continued to observe strong market trends driving growth in sustainability, recycling, water reuse and plastic conversion to fiber. We are moving numerous programs through our R&D processes to put new services and products in the hands of our commercial team. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a meaningful impact on the Institutional Solutions segment being contributed by Diversey. Beginning the second quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, strong demand for our infection prevention products and services offset volume related declines in sales to restaurants, hotels and entertainment facilities. In the remainder of 2021 and into 2022, we saw restrictions and lockdowns start to ease in some markets, resulting in stronger than anticipated sales in those markets, except for 201 ----- infection prevention products. Sales of infection products normalized in the last three quarters of 2021 and in all of 2022. As economies around the world reopened, increases in demand created significant disruptions to the global supply chain during 2022, which affected our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and at anticipated costs. These supply chain disruptions have been caused and compounded by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, industry capacity constraints, raw material shortages and labor shortages. Global logistics network challenges have resulted in delays, shortages of certain materials, and increased transportation costs. We have materially mitigated to date the impact of these disruptions through the work of our procurement and supply chain teams, but there continues to be significant uncertainties regarding the future impact of supply chain disruptions, which we cannot predict. Additionally, we are in the process of consolidating certain facilities within North America, which includes opening a new manufacturing and warehousing facility, which could present short-term operational challenges and supply chain disruptions. We are a diversified business in regards to both industry segments and global geographic regions. These different aspects of our business are each impacted differently by COVID-19, supply chain disruptions and broader economic conditions. Therefore, the recovery cycle and related timing will also be different for each segment and region.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1067,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF DIVERSEY,1067.71,Environmental Matters,1067.71.1,,"Due to the nature of our business, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to the environment, manufacturing, sale, transportation and disposal of hazardous products. These laws pertain to, among other things, air and water, management of solid and hazardous wastes, transportation, and human health and safety. Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regulate our products and often require us to obtain pre-market approval of our products and comply with specified requirements. In the U.S., we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and products intended for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and processed foods with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Such products are regulated in a similar way at the European Union level by the European Chemical Agency or by member state competent authorities. Similar requirements exist in other countries such as China, Russia and South Korea. To date, the cost of complying with such product registration requirements has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We maintain reserves for any anticipated liabilities pertaining to environmental laws and regulations. The total reserves for environmental remediation, reflect estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable, without regard to any third-party recoveries. Environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect our ability to estimate our share of any such costs. Such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at any site, the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations, widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods, changes in environmental regulations, the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology, and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites. As of March 31, 2023, Solenis had recorded environmental remediation reserves of $1.8 million, related to two ongoing and probable environmental remediation proceedings. Of the $1.8 million reserved, $1.0 million relates to potential exposure surrounding groundwater and soil contamination associated with a plant in Araraquara, Brazil. The remaining $0.8 million relates to management’s best estimate for potential exposure related to ground contamination at Solenis’ Milwaukee, Wisconsin plant as well as a reserve for a potential Environmental Protection Agency matter. The amount reserved for both matters represents management’s then-current best estimate of total expenses to be incurred. Diversey, similarly, is subject to loss contingencies resulting from environmental laws and regulations, and accrues for anticipated costs associated with investigatory and remediation efforts when an assessment has indicated that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are not reduced by potential insurance recoveries, if any. We do not believe that it is reasonably possible that liability in excess of the amounts that have been accrued for environmental matters will be material to our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 202 ----- We are not currently aware of any other material environmental liabilities or other material environmental issues at our properties or arising from our current operations. However, we cannot assure you that such liabilities or issues will not materially adversely affect our business, financial position or results of operations in the future. We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or consolidated financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Such actions seek remedies or damages, some of which are for substantial amounts. We have accrued for legal reserves of $3.4 million as of March 31, 2023 and $2.8 million as of September 30, 2022. While we cannot predict with certainty the outcome of such actions, we believe that adequate reserves have been recorded and losses already recognized with respect to such actions. In addition to its uncertain tax positions, we have accrued for various contingent liabilities related to indirect taxes. As of March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we have accrued for potential exposure related to these positions of less than $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, of which Solenis is indemnified for less than $0.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, by the former owners of Solenis’ business combinations since inception. In the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, we are a defendant in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which may result in adverse judgments, damages, fines or penalties and is subject to inquiries and investigations by various governmental and regulatory agencies concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters, we cannot state with confidence what the timing, eventual outcome, or eventual judgment, damages, fines, penalties or other impact of these pending matters will be. We believe, based on our current knowledge, that the outcome of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently pending should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Diversey is subject to various legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Based on information currently available, it is the opinion of Diversey management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

A key feature of an exempted limited partnership is that it is not a separate legal person distinct from its partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any rights or property of an exempted limited partnership (whether held in that partnership’s name or by any one or more of its general partners) shall be held or deemed to be held by the general partner (in the case of Parent, this will be the General Partner), and if more than one by the general partners jointly, upon trust as an asset of the exempted limited partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Any debts or obligations incurred by the general partner in the conduct of Parent’s business are the debts and obligations of Parent. In the event that the assets of Parent are inadequate, the General Partner will be liable for all such debts and obligations of Parent. Registration under the ELP Act entails that the exempted limited partnership becomes subject to, and the limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability (subject to the partnership agreement) and other benefits of, the ELP Act. As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be liable for the debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership save (i) as provided in the partnership agreement or otherwise agreed, (ii) if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership’s business and holds himself out as a general partner to third parties or (iii) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to section 34 of the ELP Act to return a distribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent and the limited partner has actual knowledge of such insolvency at the time of such distribution.

Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility is available to the Issuer and certain of its affiliates that are designated as co-borrowers therein and provide for senior secured asset-based, multi-currency revolving loans, swingline loans and letter of credit availability in an aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million (“Existing Revolver Amount”), subject to borrowing base capacity. Letters of credit are limited to the lesser of (a) $75.0 million and (b) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility then in effect, subject to borrowing base capacity. Bank of America, N.A. acts as administrative agent and collateral agent for our ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility matures five years after the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date. We use borrowings under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility for working capital and general corporate purposes and borrowings and issuances of letters of credit. On the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to enter into an amendment to our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, which, among other things, will provide for an increase to the Existing Revolver Amount by $200.0 million (the “ABL Facility Increase”) to an aggregate principal amount of commitments of $700.0 million, subject to borrowing base capacity. We do not expect to borrow under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility on the Acquisition Closing Date. The loans made pursuant to the ABL Facility Increase will also mature five years after the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and will be subject to the same terms and conditions as the existing ABL Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility are limited by borrowing base calculations based on the sum of specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable, eligible inventory and unrestricted cash, minus the amount of any applicable reserves. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either an adjusted Term SOFR rate (including a credit spread adjustment) plus an applicable margin or, at our option, a base rate plus an applicable margin. We may borrow on the ABL Revolving Credit Facility only up to the lesser of (i) the level of our then-current borrowing base and (ii) our committed maximum borrowing capacity. Subject to certain conditions, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility may be expanded by up to the greater of (a) the greater of (i) $250.0 million and (ii) 45% of Consolidated EBITDA (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) of Parent and its restricted subsidiaries for the most recent twelve-month period and (b) the excess of the borrowing base at such time over the aggregate commitments under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility at such time. Our ability to draw under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility or issue letters of credit thereunder is conditioned upon, among other things, our delivery of prior written notice of a borrowing or letter of credit request, as applicable, our ability to reaffirm the representations and warranties contained in the ABL Credit Agreement in all material respects and the absence of any default or event of default thereunder. Our obligations under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by Parent and its direct and indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain permitted exceptions, including exceptions based on immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries) as well as certain of Parent’s direct and indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries organized in jurisdictions where borrowing base assets are located (subject to certain permitted exceptions; provided that no foreign subsidiary guarantees any obligations of any U.S. entity). As detailed in the immediately succeeding sentence, our ABL Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of Parent’s, the Issuer’s and each of their direct and indirect whollyowned U.S. subsidiaries’ current and fixed assets (subject to certain exceptions), as well as certain assets of certain of their direct and indirect wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries; provided that no foreign assets secure any obligations of any U.S. entity. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility has a first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and a second-priority lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) (second in priority to the liens securing our Term Loan Facility and Existing Secured Notes discussed below), in each case, subject to other permitted liens. The following fees are applicable under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility: (a) an unused line fee of (i) 0.375% per annum of the unused portion of our ABL Revolving Credit Facility (excluding any swingline loans) when the average daily unused portion of such facility is less than 50% of the aggregate commitments under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility or (ii) 0.250% per annum of the unused portion of our ABL Revolving Credit 210 ----- Facility when the average daily unused portion of such facility (excluding any swingline loans) is equal to or greater than 50% of the aggregate commitments under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility, (b) letter of credit fees of (i) a participation fee equal to the applicable margin for adjusted Term SOFR rate loans, as applicable, in each case, on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit under the ABL Revolving Credit Facility and (ii) a fronting fee equal to 0.125% on the average daily amount of undrawn and unreimbursed letters of credit per annum and (c) certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders, letter of credit issuers and agents thereunder. Subject to customary provisions for discretionary and protective over-advances, we are required to make prepayments under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of the outstanding loans and letters of credit under our ABL Revolving Credit Facility exceeds the then applicable borrowing base. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability and that of our restricted subsidiaries to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay dividends, sell or otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of certain junior indebtedness, enter into transactions with affiliates or certain burdensome agreements, modify our governing documents or certain junior debt documents or change our line of business. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility requires the maintenance of a minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as set forth in the ABL Credit Agreement) of 1.00 to 1.00 (tested for the four fiscal quarter period ending on the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financials have been delivered, and at the end of each succeeding fiscal quarter thereafter) during any period commencing on the date when Adjusted Availability (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) is less than the greater of (a) 10% of the Line Cap (as such term is defined in the ABL Credit Agreement) and (b) $25.0 million and ending on the date on which Adjusted Availability has exceeded the greater of (a) 10% of the Line Cap and (b) $25.0 million for at least 30 consecutive calendar days. Our ABL Revolving Credit Facility provides that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, our obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated. Such events of default include payment defaults to the lenders thereunder, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments, pension-plan events reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect, certain change of control events and other customary events of default, subject to certain materiality levels, default triggers, cure and grace periods and/or baskets.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,848,DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS,848.2,Term Loan Facility,848.2.1,,"On the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date, we entered into our Term Loan Facility with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and certain other arrangers and lenders, which was fully drawn to fund, in part, the Solenis Acquisition. Thereafter, we also entered into an incremental amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement on April 6, 2022. As of the date of this offering memorandum approximately $1,938.0 million, subject to exchange rates, of term loans were outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, consisting of a $1,110.0 million Dollar tranche (the “Initial Dollar Term Loans”), a $300.0 million Dollar incremental tranche (the “2022 Incremental Term Loans”) and a €500.0 million Euro tranche. On the Acquisition Closing Date, we intend to enter into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement which, among other things, will provide for an incremental Dollar term loan tranche in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $750.0 million (“Incremental Term Loan”), which may be increased at our election up to an amount sufficient to fund certain original issue discount or upfront fees in respect. We expect to borrow the Incremental Term Loan in full in a single drawing on the Acquisition Closing Date, the proceeds of which will be used, together with other available proceeds, to, among other things, finance the Acquisition. Consistent with the existing Term Loan Facility, the Incremental Term Loan Facility will mature seven years after the Solenis Acquisition Closing Date and, although it is not fungible with the Initial Dollar Term Loans or the 2022 Incremental Term Loans for federal income tax purposes, will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the existing Term Loan Facility, subject to certain exceptions including that (x) subject to certain exclusions, a 1.00% premium will be payable on any prepayment in connection with certain repricing transactions prior to the date that is six months after the Acquisition Closing Date and (y) subject to certain exclusions, the effective yield with respect to any syndicated, Dollar-denominated, incremental term loans incurred under the Term Loan Credit Agreement on or prior to the date that is six months after the Acquisition Closing Date, may not be more than 0.75% higher than the corresponding effective yield for the Incremental Term Loans unless the interest rate margins with respect to the Incremental Term Loan are increased by an amount equal to the difference between 211 ----- the effective yield with respect to such additional incremental term loans and the corresponding effective yield on the Incremental Term Loans minus 0.75%. Subject to certain conditions, our Term Loan Facility, without the consent of the then-existing lenders (but subject to the receipt of commitments), may be increased (or new incremental term loan facilities added) in an aggregate principal amount for all such increases, incremental facilities and certain incremental equivalent debt of no greater than (a) the greater of (x) $600.0 million and (y) 100.0% of Consolidated EBITDA (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement), minus (b) any amounts previously used pursuant to the basket in clause (a), plus (c) an amount equal to all voluntary prepayments, repurchases and redemptions of, among other things, pari passu term loans borrowed under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and certain other indebtedness, plus (d) an unlimited amount, so long as on a pro forma basis, either (1) the Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) either (x) would not exceed 5:10:1:00 or (y) at the election of the Issuer if incurred in connection with a permitted acquisition or other permitted investment, would not increase or (2) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement) is not less than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio prior to such increase. Our loans incurred under each Dollar-denominated tranche under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (including the Incremental Term Loans) amortize in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1.00% per annum of the original principal amount of such tranche. The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the Dollar-denominated tranches of our Term Loan Facility is, at our option, either (1) the base rate (which is the highest of (x) the then-current federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 0.50%, (y) the prime rate on such day and (z) (i) with respect to the Initial Dollar Term Loans, the one-month LIBOR for a period commencing on such date plus 1.00% and (ii) with respect to the 2022 Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans, the one-month Term SOFR for a period commencing on such date plus 1.00%) plus an applicable margin or (2) in the case of the Initial Dollar Term Loans, one-, three- or six-month LIBOR or, if agreed to by all lenders of LIBOR loans, 12-month LIBOR or any shorter period (selected at our option) plus an applicable margin, or in the case of the 2022 Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans, one-, three- or six-month Term SOFR or, if agreed to by all lenders of Term SOFR loans, 12-month Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. The Initial Dollar Term Loans are subject to a LIBOR floor and the 2022 Incremental Term Loans and the Incremental Term Loans are subject to a Term SOFR floor. We expect to replace the LIBOR reference rate with respect to our Initial Dollar Term Loans with Term SOFR (which may be subject to a spread adjustment) in accordance with the terms of our Term Loan Credit Agreement on or prior to June 30, 2023. Our loans incurred under the Euro tranche of our Term Loan Facility do not have scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. The interest rate margin applicable to borrowings under the Euro tranche of our Term Loan Facility is either one-, three- or six-month EURIBOR or, if agreed to by all relevant lenders, 12-month EURIBOR or any shorter period (selected at our option) plus an applicable margin. The Euro tranche under our Term Loan Facility is subject to a EURIBOR floor.

If any Notes are listed on an exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will satisfy any requirement of such exchange as to paying agents, registrars and transfer agents and will comply with any notice requirements under such exchange in connection with any change of paying agent, registrar or transfer agent.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

On the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), Parent and each of Parent’s Wholly Owned Subsidiaries that are Domestic Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a borrower and/or guarantor under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will jointly and severally, irrevocably, fully and unconditionally guarantee on a senior secured basis the performance and punctual payment when due, whether at 221 ----- Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all Obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture and the Notes (including interest, fees and expenses which, but for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to the Issuer, would have accrued on any Obligation, whether or not a claim is allowed against the Issuer for such interest, fees and expenses in the related bankruptcy proceeding) to the holders, the Notes Collateral Agent and the Trustee, whether for payment of principal or interest on the Notes, fees, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed by such Guarantors being herein called the “Secured Guaranteed Obligations”). Each Note Guarantee of a Guarantor will be a senior secured obligation of such Guarantor and will: - be secured on a first-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of such Guarantor under any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral from time to time owned by such Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens, as described under “—Security— Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants— Liens” and “— Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”; - be secured on a second-priority basis, equally and ratably with all Obligations of such Guarantor under any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, by Liens on the Current Asset Collateral from time to time owned by such Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions and Permitted Liens (including Liens on the Current Asset Collateral securing any Priority Lien Obligations), as described under “— Security—Collateral,” “—Security—Intercreditor Arrangements,” “—Certain Covenants— Liens” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Liens”; - without giving effect to collateral arrangements, rank contractually equal in right of payment with all existing and future senior Indebtedness of such Guarantor (including Indebtedness under the Existing Notes and the Credit Agreements); - rank contractually senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Indebtedness of such Guarantor, if any; - be effectively senior to any existing and future unsecured Indebtedness of the Issuer and Indebtedness secured by Liens junior to the Liens securing the Notes to the extent of the value of the Collateral (including, in the case of the Fixed Asset Collateral, the Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement); - be effectively equal to any existing and future Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Indentures; - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer that is secured by Liens on assets that do not constitute Collateral to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness; - be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Priority Lien Obligations of such Guarantor (including such Guarantor’s guarantee of Indebtedness under the ABL Credit Agreement), to the extent of the value of the Current Asset Collateral securing such Indebtedness; and - be structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of such Guarantor’s NonGuarantor Subsidiaries. Each Note Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the applicable Guarantor without rendering the Indenture or the Note Guarantee, as it relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to void the Notes and/or the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Notes) and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” After the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary (unless such Subsidiary is an Excluded Subsidiary or is already a Guarantor) that is a guarantor or a borrower under the Term Loan Credit Agreement to 222 ----- execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture (or to execute the Indenture to the extent the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will guarantee performance and payment of the Notes on the same senior secured basis. See “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees.” Each Note Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and, subject to the next succeeding paragraph, shall: (1) remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the Secured Guaranteed Obligations; (2) be binding upon each such Guarantor and its successors and assigns; and (3) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent, the holders and their successors, transferees and assigns. A Note Guarantee of a Subsidiary Guarantor will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon: (a) the sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, Division or dissolution) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such transaction) Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, if after such transaction the Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or (b) all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary Guarantor if such sale, exchange, disposition or other transfer (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation, Division or dissolution) is made in compliance with the Indenture; (c) the Issuer designating such Subsidiary Guarantor to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions set forth under “—Certain Covenants—Restricted Payments” and the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary”; (d) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), is required to guarantee the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Future Guarantees,” the release or discharge of the Guarantee by such Subsidiary Guarantor of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or the repayment of the Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock, in each case, that resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes, except by reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of such Indebtedness or if a release or discharge is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such other Guarantee or direct obligation; (e) the Issuer’s exercise of its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” or if the Issuer’s Obligations under the Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture or through redemption or repurchase of all of the Notes or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture; (f) the release or discharge of the Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, such Subsidiary Guarantor of the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or if such release or discharge is by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such Guarantee or direct obligation; (g) such Subsidiary Guarantor becoming an Excluded Subsidiary; (h) such Subsidiary Guarantor ceasing to be a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent, including as a result of any foreclosure of any pledge or security interest securing Indebtedness or any exercise of remedies in respect thereof in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreements, as applicable; _provided that such Subsidiary Guarantor shall only be released if such Subsidiary became a non-_ Wholly Owned Subsidiary pursuant to a transaction where such Subsidiary becomes a bona fide joint venture where the other Person taking an equity interest in such Subsidiary is not an Affiliate of Parent (other than as a result of such joint venture); 223 ----- (i) as described in “—Certain Covenants—Changes in Covenants When Notes Rated Investment Grade”; or (j) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.” The Note Guarantee of Parent will be released if the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or covenant defeasance option as described under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance,” if the Issuer’s Obligations under the Indenture are discharged (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described below under “—Satisfaction and Discharge” or through redemption or repurchase of all the Notes or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the Indenture or if there is a release or discharge of such Note Guarantee by, or direct obligation of, Parent of the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, except by reason of payment under or the termination or repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or a discharge or release by or as a result of payment in connection with the enforcement of remedies under such guarantee or direct obligation. Unless a Subsidiary is a Guarantor, claims of creditors of such Subsidiaries (including trade creditors) and claims of preferred stockholders (if any) of such Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Issuer, including holders of the Notes. The Notes, therefore, will be structurally subordinated to claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred stockholders (if any) of Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Although the Indenture will contain limitations on the amount of additional Indebtedness that Parent and certain of its Subsidiaries may incur, such limitations are subject to a number of significant exceptions. See “—Certain Covenants—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” below. As of the Acquisition Closing Date (or as of the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), all of Parent’s Subsidiaries are expected to be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under the circumstances described under “—Certain Covenants,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of Parent’s Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” The Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture and will not guarantee the Notes. On the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), each of Parent’s Subsidiaries (other than Excluded Subsidiaries) that is a borrower and/or guarantor under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will be a Guarantor. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2023, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the offering, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 68% of our Net sales and approximately 63% of our Pro Forma Combined Adjusted EBITDA. As of March 31, 2023, after giving effect to the offering, our non-Guarantor subsidiaries represented approximately 60% of our total assets (excluding intercompany receivables and investments in subsidiaries) and approximately 43% of our total liabilities (excluding intercompany payables).",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.1,Brief Description of the Notes,124.1.7,Security,"_Collateral General_ If the Acquisition Closing Date occurs after the Issue Date, the Notes will be secured by the Escrow Account initially. On the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by Liens on the Collateral on an equal and ratable basis with all Parity Lien Obligations. These Liens will be senior in priority to the Liens securing all Priority Lien Obligations in respect of Fixed Asset Collateral and junior in priority to the Liens securing all Priority Lien Obligations in respect of Current Asset Collateral. The Liens on the Collateral that will secure the Notes and Note Guarantees will be granted under the Security Documents in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the holders of the Notes and the Trustee. The Liens on the Collateral that secure the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term _Loan Obligations”) have been granted to the collateral agent under the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Collateral Agent”) pursuant to separate security documentation. The Liens on the Collateral that secure the_ Obligations under the Existing Secured Notes have also been granted to the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents under the Existing Secured Indentures pursuant to separate security documentation. The relative rights among the creditors of the Term Loan Obligations and the holders of the other Parity Lien Obligations (including the holders of the Notes and the Existing Secured Notes) will be governed by the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement 224 ----- as set forth below under the caption “—Intercreditor Arrangements—Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement.” The Liens on the Collateral that secure the Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement (the “Priority Lien _Obligations”) have been granted to the collateral agent under the ABL Credit Agreement (the “ABL Collateral Agent”) pursuant to separate security documentation. The relative rights among the creditors of the Priority Lien_ Obligations, on the one hand, and the holders of the Parity Lien Obligations (including the holders of the Notes and the Existing Secured Notes and the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement), on the other hand, will be governed by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement as described below under the caption “—Intercreditor Arrangements—ABL Intercreditor Agreement.” The Collateral comprises substantially all of the assets and property of the Issuer and the Guarantors, whether real, personal or mixed, other than the Excluded Assets and other than any assets released from the Collateral. The Collateral will exclude the following assets and property (“Excluded Assets”), including, without limitation: (1) (i) any fee-owned real property that (A) is located outside the United States, (B) has a fair market value equal to or less than $25.0 million or (C) contains improvements located in an area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency) as a “special flood hazard area” and (ii) any real property leasehold interests; (2) interest in any contracts, permits, licenses, leases, Accounts, General Intangibles (other than any Equity Interests), Payment Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Letter-of-Credit Rights and Promissory Notes, if the grant of a security interest or Lien therein is prohibited as a matter of law, rule or regulation or under the terms of such contracts, permits, licenses, leases, Accounts, General Intangibles, Payment Intangibles, Chattel Paper, Letter-of-Credit Rights and Promissory Notes, in each case after giving effect to any applicable Uniform Commercial Code, other applicable law and principles of equity; (3) the voting Equity Interests of (i) any first tier Foreign Subsidiary that is a CFC in excess of 65% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests thereof and (ii) any FSHCO in excess of 65% of the outstanding voting Equity Interests thereof; (4) assets subject to Capital Lease Obligations, purchase money financing and cash to secure letter of credit reimbursement obligations to the extent such Capital Lease Obligations, purchase money financing or letters of credit are permitted under the Indenture and the terms thereof prohibit a grant of a security interest therein; (5) assets sold to a person who is not the Issuer or a Guarantor in compliance with the Indenture; (6) assets owned by a Subsidiary after the release of the guaranty of the Obligations of such Subsidiary pursuant to the Indenture and each other document evidencing Parity Lien Obligations; (7) any motor vehicles and any other goods subject to a certificate of title law of any state (to the extent a security interest therein cannot be perfected by a UCC filing); (8) any application for registration of a trademark filed with the PTO on an intent-to-use basis until such time (if any) as a statement of use or amendment to allege use is accepted by the PTO, at which time such trademark shall automatically become part of the Collateral and subject to the security interest of the Security Documents; (9) Equity Interests in any Person (i) other than the Issuer and Wholly Owned Subsidiaries to the extent a pledge thereof is not permitted by the terms of such Person’s charter documents or joint venture or shareholders agreements and other organizational documents and (ii) to the extent a pledge thereof is not permitted by any law, rule or regulation, in each case of clause (i) and (ii) after giving effect to Article 9 of the UCC and other applicable law; (10) any Letter-of-Credit Right (to the extent a security interest in such Letter-of-Credit Right cannot be perfected by a UCC filing) and any Commercial Tort Claim, in each case, with a value (as determined in good faith by Issuer) of less than $30,000,000; 225 ----- (11) assets to the extent the cost of obtaining a security interest or perfection thereof are excessive in relation to the benefits to the holders of the notes of the security afforded thereby as determined by the Issuer in good faith in writing delivered to the Notes Collateral Agent; (12) “margin stock” (within the meaning of Regulation U); (13) Excluded Accounts (other than any account included in such definition solely by virtue of being a zero balance account); (14) Equity Interests in Unrestricted Subsidiaries and Immaterial Subsidiaries; (15) certain segregated deposits that constitute Permitted Liens; and (16) any asset to the extent granting a security interest in such asset would result in a material adverse tax consequence to any Permitted Parent and/or its Subsidiaries, as reasonably determined in good faith by the Issuer and notified in writing to the Notes Collateral Agent; provided that this clause (16) shall not apply to any intercompany Indebtedness for borrowed money issued in connection with the Solenis Acquisition; _provided, however, that Excluded Assets will not include (a) any proceeds, substitutions or replacements of any_ Excluded Assets (except to the extent such proceeds, substitutions or replacements would themselves constitute Excluded Assets) or (b) any asset of the Issuer or the Guarantors that secures Obligations with respect to the ABL Credit Agreement or the Term Loan Credit Agreement; provided, further, that capitalized terms used in clauses (2) and (10) above and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning given to such term in the UCC as in effect on the date hereof in the State of New York. _Certain Limitations on the Collateral_ No appraisals of any of the Collateral have been prepared by or on behalf of the Issuer or any Guarantor in connection with the issuance and sale of the Notes. The value of the Collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on many factors. Consequently, liquidating the Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. The Collateral securing our obligations under the Notes and the Note Guarantees is shared with other creditors. If there is a default, the value of the Collateral may not be sufficient to repay the creditors of Priority Lien Obligations and Parity Lien Obligations, including the holders of the Notes. The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors, including, among others, prevailing interest rates, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral will be dependent on numerous factors, including the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time, the timing and the manner of the sale and the availability of buyers. By its nature, some of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value or market. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees (after taking into account all of our other Indebtedness that is secured on all or any portion of the Collateral on a senior or pari passu basis). Any claim for the difference between the amount, if any, realized by holders of the Notes from the sale of Collateral securing the Notes and the Obligations in respect of the Notes and the Note Guarantees (after application of any proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral to the Priority Lien Obligations) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ unsecured or undersecured senior Indebtedness and other unsubordinated Obligations, including the Existing Unsecured Notes and trade payables. To the extent that third parties establish Liens on the Collateral, such third parties could have rights and remedies with respect to the assets that, if exercised, could adversely affect the value of the Collateral or the ability of the Notes Collateral Agent or the holders to realize or foreclose on the Collateral. The Issuer may also issue Additional Notes after the Issue Date as described herein or otherwise incur Parity Lien Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations that would be secured by the Collateral, the effect of which would be to increase the amount of Indebtedness secured equally and ratably by the Collateral or secured on a priority basis with respect to the Current Asset Collateral. The ability of the holders to realize on the Collateral would also be subject to applicable bankruptcy law limitations in the event of a bankruptcy. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—The value of the Collateral securing the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the Notes and the other obligations secured by an equal and ratable lien on the Collateral or a senior lien on the Current Asset Collateral.” _Release of Collateral_ 226 ----- The Issuer and the Guarantors are entitled to the releases of property and other assets included in the Collateral from the Liens securing the Notes under any one or more of the following circumstances: (1) in part, as to any property or assets constituting Collateral, to enable us to consummate the disposition of such property or assets (to a Person that is not the Issuer or a Guarantor) to the extent permitted under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”; (2) if such property becomes an Excluded Asset; (3) as to the property and assets of a Subsidiary Guarantor that is released from its Note Guarantee in accordance with the Indenture; (4) as described under “—Intercreditor Arrangements”; or (5) as described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver” below. The security interests in all Collateral securing the Notes also will be released upon (i) payment in full of the principal of, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, on, the Notes and all other Obligations with respect to the Notes under the Indenture, the Note Guarantees and the Security Documents that are due and payable at or prior to the time such principal, together with accrued and unpaid interest and premium, if any, are paid (including pursuant to a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as described below under “— Satisfaction and Discharge”) or (ii) a legal defeasance or covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes under the Indenture as described below under “—Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance.” _Creation and Perfection of Certain Security Interests Post-Closing_ Certain mortgages with respect to the Collateral (including any related title insurance and surveys) may not be in place on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or certain other security interests (including control agreements with respect to deposit accounts to the extent required hereunder) may not be created or perfected on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date). See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness— Security interests over certain of the Collateral may not be in place or perfected by the time the Notes are issued. Any issues that we are not able to resolve in connection with the granting of such security interests may impact the value of the Collateral. Creation or perfection of such security interests after the issuance of the Notes increases the risk that the liens granted by those security interests could be avoided in bankruptcy.” To the extent any such security interest could not be created or perfected or title insurance or surveys could not be obtained by such date, the Issuer and the Guarantors will agree to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to do or cause to be done all acts and things that would be required to have all security interests in the Collateral duly created and enforceable and perfected, to the extent required by the Indenture or the Security Documents, and obtain title insurance and surveys within 90 days of the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date); _provided that the Issuer and Guarantors will enter into the Security Documents and file UCC financing statements_ on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date). There will be no independent assurance prior to issuance of the Notes that all assets or properties contemplated to be mortgaged or pledged as security for the Notes will be mortgaged or pledged, or that we hold the real or personal property interests we represent we hold or that we may mortgage or pledge such interests, or that there will be no lien encumbering such real or personal property interests other than those permitted by the Indenture. Delivery of mortgages or other documents necessary to create or perfect security interests in other Collateral after the Issue Date increases the risk that the mortgages or other security interests could be avoidable in bankruptcy. Additionally, the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the Notes will not require us to take a number of actions to perfect or to improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Notes Collateral Agent for the benefit of itself, the holders of the Notes and the Trustee; provided that no control agreements with respect to deposit accounts and securities accounts shall be required (the “Perfection Exceptions”). Failure to create and perfect a security interest in the Collateral or to obtain title insurance, as required by the Indenture and the security documents entered into in connection with the Notes, within the required time period will constitute an Event of Default (as defined below) if and to the extent provided under clauses (3), (9) or (10) under the caption “—Events of Default and Remedies” below. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes has any duty or responsibility to see to or monitor the performance 227 ----- of Parent and its Subsidiaries with regard to these matters or to determine whether commercially reasonable efforts have been made by the Issuer. _Intercreditor Arrangements_ The Liens on the Collateral securing the Notes will be subject to two separate intercreditor agreements. On the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the Notes Collateral Agent will enter into a joinder agreement to become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to set forth its relative rights in the Collateral, which provides for the pari passu nature of their Liens, including any Liens that may, in the future, secure additional Parity Lien Indebtedness. In addition, on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date), the Notes Collateral Agent will, enter into a joinder agreement to become a party to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, which governs the relative rights of the Liens on the Collateral in favor of the ABL Collateral Agent, the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents and the Notes Collateral Agent, and provides for the senior priority of the ABL Collateral Agent in the Current Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents, the Notes Collateral Agent and the representative of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, and also provides for the senior priority of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents and the Notes Collateral Agent in the Fixed Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the ABL Collateral Agent. If any other Indebtedness is designated as Parity Lien Indebtedness and is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be secured by the Collateral, the representatives of the holders of such other Indebtedness will also become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture provide that such intercreditor agreements may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders of the Notes to, among other things, add other parties. Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the Notes Collateral Agent (and Trustee, if applicable) to enter into and perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreements, binding the holders of the Notes to the terms thereof by their acceptance of the Notes. _Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement_ Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Collateral Agent” has the right to act or refrain from acting with respect to any Collateral. The Controlling Collateral Agent is initially the Term Loan Collateral Agent and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of Parity Lien Obligations that are Term Loan Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the authorized representative of the Series of Parity Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Parity Lien Obligations (excluding the Series of Term Loan Obligations) with respect to such Collateral, but solely to the extent that such Series of Parity Lien Obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the Term Loan Obligations then outstanding (the “Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent”); provided, however, that if there are two outstanding Series of Parity Lien Obligations which have an equal outstanding principal amount, the Series of Parity Lien Obligations with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have the larger outstanding principal amount for purposes of this definition. With respect to any Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Collateral. The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and (b) the Controlling Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and 228 ----- that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Parity Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Parity Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of Parity Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action (including delivery by the Controlling Collateral Agent of a notice to the ABL Collateral Agent that purports to commence an ABL Standstill Period (or similar term defined in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) thereunder) with respect to such Collateral or any portion thereof, (2) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent is stayed under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement actions with respect to such Collateral or any portion thereof or (3) at any time the Issuer or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent is initially the Term Loan Collateral Agent and the Notes Collateral Agent will have no rights to take any action under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent or unless expressly permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral. Each of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations also agree that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the Notes Collateral Agent and each other authorized representative or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations may file a proof of claim or statement of interest with respect to the Parity Lien Obligations owed to such party; (ii) the Notes Collateral Agent and each other authorized representative or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations may (but shall not be obligated to) take any action to preserve or protect the validity and enforceability of the Liens granted in favor of such parties, provided that no such action is, or could reasonably be expected to be, (A) adverse, in any material respect, to the Liens granted in favor of the Controlling Secured Parties or the rights of the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other Controlling Secured Parties to exercise remedies in respect thereof or (B) otherwise inconsistent with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (iii) the Notes Collateral Agent and each other authorized representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations may file any responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of such party, including any claims secured by the Collateral, in each case, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Parity Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement but including the ABL Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the payments, proceeds or distribution of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral received by any authorized representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations and any such distribution or payment in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding to which the Parity Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement (subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds, or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) shall, subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, be applied among the Parity Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the Parity Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each authorized representative (in its capacity as the agent for the applicable Parity Lien Obligations) and the Trustee; provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of Parity Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing Parity Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the Parity Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) 229 ----- and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series of Parity Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest, fees, or expenses on the Parity Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding. It is the intention of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series that the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of any other Series) bear the risk of any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity Lien Obligations), (y) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations or the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations that is not Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series). In the event of any Impairment with respect to any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, the results of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and the rights of the holders of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions in respect of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations permitted by the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement ) set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall be modified to the extent necessary so that the effects of such Impairment are borne solely by the holders of the Series of such Parity Lien Obligations subject to such Impairment. Additionally, in the event the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Parity Lien Obligations or the Parity Lien Documents governing such Parity Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may institute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Parity Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Parity Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Parity Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Parity Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Current Asset Collateral, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other authorized representatives for the benefit of itself, the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and each other Series of holders of Parity Lien Obligations upon such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Each holder of Parity Lien Obligations acknowledges that the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement provides that if the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of DIP Financing (as defined below) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code and/or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each holder of Parity Lien Obligations will agree not to object to any such DIP Financing or to the Liens on the Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) and/or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Collateral, unless the Controlling Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security Documents and Indenture to the extent the Controlling 230 ----- Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent) with respect to such Collateral opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens and/or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will subordinate its Liens with respect to such Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any holders of Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank pari passu with the Liens on any such Collateral granted to secure the Parity Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party will confirm the priorities with respect to such Collateral as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement ), in each case so long as: (A) the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series retain the benefit of their Liens on all such Collateral pledged to the DIP Lenders, including proceeds, products, offsprings, profits, or rents, as applicable, thereof arising after the commencement of such proceeding, with the same priority vis-a-vis all the other holders of Parity Lien Obligations (other than any Liens of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens) as existed prior to the commencement of the insolvency or liquidation proceeding; (B) the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series are granted Liens on any additional or replacement collateral pledged to any holder of Parity Lien Obligations as adequate protection or otherwise in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, with the same priority vis-a-vis the holders of Parity Lien Obligations as set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (other than any Liens of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations constituting DIP Financing Liens); (C) if any amount of such DIP Financing and/or cash collateral is applied to repay any of the Parity Lien Obligations, such amount is applied pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; and (D) if any holders of Parity Lien Obligations are granted adequate protection, including in the form of periodic payments, in connection with such DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral, the proceeds of such adequate protection are applied pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement; _provided that the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series will have a right to object to the grant of a Lien to_ secure the DIP Financing over any Collateral subject to Liens in favor of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of such Series or its representative that do not constitute Collateral; and provided, further, that the holders of Parity Lien Obligations receiving adequate protection shall not object to any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations receiving adequate protection comparable to any adequate protection granted to such holders of Parity Lien Obligations in connection with a DIP Financing and/or use of cash collateral. The holders of Parity Lien Obligations acknowledge that the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Parity Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds of the Collateral set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of any Series. _ABL Intercreditor Agreement General_ The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides, among other things, that, notwithstanding the date, time, method, manner or order of grant, attachment or perfection of any Liens securing the Obligations under the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations (including the Obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the Existing Secured Indentures) granted on the Collateral or of any Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations granted on the Collateral and notwithstanding any provision of any UCC, or any other applicable law or the ABL Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures or the Indenture, or any defect or deficiencies in, or failure to perfect, the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations, the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, and whether or not such Liens securing, or purporting to secure, any Priority Lien Obligations or the Notes or any other Parity Lien Obligations are subordinated to any Lien securing any other obligation of the 231 ----- Issuer, or any other Guarantor or any other Person or otherwise subordinated, voided, avoided, invalidated or lapsed, or any other circumstance whatsoever, the ABL Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, and each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, each agrees that (i) any Lien of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Current Asset Collateral, whether now or hereafter held by or on behalf of the ABL Collateral Agent or any holders of Priority Lien Obligations or any agent or trustee therefor, regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be senior in all respects and prior to all Liens on the Current Asset Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Parity Lien Obligations (including the obligations under the Notes), and (ii) any Lien of the Parity Lien Representatives on the Fixed Asset Collateral, whether now or hereafter held by or on behalf of the Parity Lien Representatives, any holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations or any agent or trustee therefor regardless of how acquired, whether by grant, possession, statute, operation of law, subrogation or otherwise, shall be senior in all respects to all Liens on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing or purporting to secure any Priority Lien Obligations. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Current Asset Collateral pledged to secure the Priority Lien Obligations will include certain collateral of foreign subsidiaries of Parent (the “Foreign Collateral”) that will not secure the Parity Lien Obligations and no Parity Lien Representative will commence or take any enforcement action with respect to the Foreign Collateral and will be subject to certain other restrictions with respect to the Foreign Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Fixed Asset Collateral pledged to secure the Parity Lien Obligations will include certain real estate assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors (the “Real Estate Assets”) that will not secure the Priority Lien Obligations and no ABL Collateral Agent will commence or take any enforcement action with respect to the Real Estate Assets and will be subject to certain other restrictions with respect to the Real Estate Assets. The ABL Collateral Agent, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, and each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and/or the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, each further agrees that during any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will be enforceable as a subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law, and the ABL Collateral Agent, the Parity Lien Representatives, and the agents for any other Parity Lien Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations will have the rights to seek adequate protection in such proceedings in accordance with and subject to certain limitations set forth under the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, including with respect to the relative priority of their respective security interests in the Current Asset Collateral and the Fixed Asset Collateral. Under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, only the “Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent” will have the right to act or refrain from acting on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations with respect to any Collateral. The Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is initially the Term Loan Collateral Agent and will remain the Term Loan Collateral Agent until the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date occurs under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. _Exercise of Remedies_ The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that (x) so long as Priority Lien Obligations remain outstanding, none of the Parity Lien Representative, nor any other holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations may (A) exercise any rights or remedies against the Current Asset Collateral or institute any enforcement action with respect to such rights or remedies; provided, however, that the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security Documents and Indenture to the extent the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent) or any Person authorized by it may exercise any or all such rights or remedies after the passage of a period of at least 180 days has elapsed since the later of: (A) the date on which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent (or the applicable Parity Lien Representative) declared the existence of an Event of Default and demanded the repayment of all the principal amount of any Parity Lien Obligations; and (B) the date on which the ABL Collateral Agent received notice from the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent of such declaration of an Event of Default and that the Parity Lien Obligations are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of the acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable documents (the “Fixed Asset Standstill Period”); _provided, further, however, that notwithstanding anything in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement to the contrary, in no_ event shall any Parity Lien Representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations (A) exercise any rights or remedies with respect to (x) the Current Asset Collateral if, notwithstanding the expiration of the Fixed Asset Standstill Period, the ABL Collateral Agent (or any person authorized by it) or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations shall have commenced and be diligently pursuing the exercise of their rights or remedies with respect to all or any material portion of such Collateral (prompt notice of such exercise to be given to the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent) or shall be stayed under applicable law from exercising such rights and remedies or (y) the 232 ----- Foreign Collateral, (B) contest or object to any proceeding or action brought by the agents for any Priority Lien Obligations with respect to the Current Asset Collateral or (C) object to the forbearance by the holders of Priority Lien Obligations from bringing or pursuing any foreclosure proceeding or action or any other exercise of any rights or remedies relating to the Current Asset Collateral or such Priority Lien Obligations and (y) reciprocal restrictions apply to the ABL Collateral Agent for enforcing rights and remedies against the Fixed Asset Collateral. Subject to the foregoing, the ABL Collateral Agent and holders of the senior liens on the Current Asset Collateral and the Fixed Asset Collateral have the exclusive right (subject to the Fixed Asset Standstill Period) to enforce rights, exercise remedies and make determinations regarding the release, disposition or restrictions with respect to the Collateral in which they hold the senior lien without consultation with any agent or holders of the liens with junior priority in the same Collateral; provided that the Parity Lien Representatives or the holders of the Notes or any other Parity Lien Obligations may; (1) file a claim with respect to the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations; provided that an insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor; (2) take any action in order to create, perfect, preserve or protect (but not enforce) its Lien on any of the Collateral; provided that such action shall not be inconsistent with the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and shall not be adverse to the priority status of the Liens on the Current Asset Collateral, or the rights of the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations to exercise remedies in respect thereof; (3) file any necessary or appropriate responsive or defensive pleadings in opposition to any motion, claim, adversary proceeding or other pleading made by any Person objecting to or otherwise seeking the disallowance of the claims or Liens of the holders of the Notes, including any claims secured by the Current Asset Collateral, if any, in each case in accordance with the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; (4) file any pleadings, objections, motions or agreements which assert rights or interests available to unsecured creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor arising under either any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or applicable non-bankruptcy law, in each case not inconsistent with, or prohibited by, the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; (5) vote on any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, file any proof of claim, make other filings and make any arguments and motions that are, in each case, in accordance with the terms of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, with respect to the obligations under the Notes and the Fixed Asset Collateral; and (6) exercise any of its rights or remedies with respect to any of the Collateral (other than the Foreign Collateral) after the termination of the Fixed Asset Standstill Period to the extent permitted by the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will be subject to similar restrictions with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of each holder of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of each holder of Priority Lien Obligations, agrees that it will not (and waives any right to) contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations or any of the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations in the Collateral, the allowability of the claims asserted with respect to the Obligations under the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, or the Priority Lien Obligations in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, or the provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; provided that nothing in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be construed to prevent or impair the rights of any collateral agent or any holder of Priority Lien Obligations, holder of the Notes, or holder of any other Parity Lien Obligations to enforce the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, including the provisions thereof relating to the priority of the Liens securing the respective obligations. 233 ----- So long as neither the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations nor the discharge of obligations under the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations has occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor, any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any collateral agent or any holders of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations or holders of Priority Lien Obligations in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off) relating to the Collateral or otherwise received in contravention of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith paid over to the appropriate collateral agent with a senior lien on such Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Parity Lien Obligations or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Each collateral agent will, under the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, be authorized by the other collateral agents to make any such endorsements as agent for the other collateral agents or any holders of the Notes or Parity Lien Obligations or holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be. This authorization is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations and the discharge of obligations under the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations. _Collateral Access Rights_ The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that the ABL Collateral Agent will have access to and a rent free right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral for the purpose of arranging for and effecting the sale or disposition of Current Asset Collateral, including the production, completion, packaging and other preparation of such Current Asset Collateral for sale or disposition for a period, after the commencement of an enforcement period, which begins on the day that the ABL Collateral Agent provides the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent with the notice of its election to request access to any mortgaged premises pursuant to the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and ends on the earliest of (i) the 180th day after the ABL Collateral Agent obtains the ability to use, take physical possession of, remove or otherwise control the use or access to the Collateral located on such mortgaged premises following a collateral enforcement action plus such number of days, if any, after the ABL Collateral Agent obtains access to such Collateral that it is stayed or otherwise prohibited by law or court order from exercising remedies with respect to Collateral located on such mortgaged premises, (ii) the date on which all or substantially all of the Current Asset Collateral located on such mortgaged premises is sold, collected or liquidated, (iii) the date on which the discharge of the Priority Lien Obligations occurs and (iv) the date on which the event of default that was the subject of the applicable Enforcement Notice relating to such enforcement period has been cured to the satisfaction of the ABL Collateral Agent or the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, as applicable, or waived in writing in accordance with the requirements of the ABL Credit Agreement, Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures, the Indenture or documents governing other Parity Lien Indebtedness, as applicable. Each Parity Lien Representative will grant (to the full extent of its rights and interests), without recourse, representation or warranty, the ABL Collateral Agent and its agents, representatives and designees (a) a royalty free, rent free non-exclusive license and lease to use all of the Fixed Asset Collateral constituting intellectual property, to complete the sale of inventory and (b) a royalty free non-exclusive license (which will be binding on any successor or assignee of the intellectual property) to use any and all intellectual property, in each case, at any time in connection with its collateral enforcement action; provided, however, the royalty free, rent free non-exclusive license and lease granted in clause (a) shall immediately expire upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of all such inventory. _Set Off and Tracing_ The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, all funds deposited in an account subject to a control agreement that constitute Current Asset Collateral and then applied to the Priority Lien Obligations shall be treated as Current Asset Collateral and, unless the ABL Collateral Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the ABL Collateral Agent through the Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts that are subject to such control agreements, are proceeds of or otherwise constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Parity Lien Representatives and the holders of Parity Lien Obligations; provided that after the issuance of an Enforcement Notice by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, all identifiable proceeds of Fixed Asset Collateral shall be deemed Fixed Asset Collateral, whether or not held in an account subject to a control agreement. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement further provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited in an account subject to a deposit account control agreement or a securities account control agreement, shall not (as between the Parity Lien Representatives, the ABL Collateral 234 ----- Agent, and the respective secured parties) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral. _Release of Liens_ If in connection with the exercise of the ABL Collateral Agent’s remedies in respect of any Collateral as provided for in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, then the Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, on the Current Asset Collateral sold or disposed of in connection with such exercise, shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or on behalf of the holders of the Notes and any other Parity Lien Obligations, promptly shall execute and deliver to the ABL Collateral Agent or such Issuer or Guarantor such termination statements, releases and other documents as the ABL Collateral Agent or such Issuer or Guarantor may request to effectively confirm such release. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with an exercise of remedies with respect thereto by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent. In addition, if in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Collateral permitted under the terms of the ABL Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture (other than in connection with the exercise of the ABL Collateral Agent’s rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral as provided for in applicable provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement), the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, in each case other than (A) in connection with the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Indenture, then the Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, on such Collateral shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the ABL Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with such a sale or other disposition in which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent releases its Liens on such Fixed Asset Collateral. _Amendments_ The Indenture and the documents governing any other Parity Lien Obligation may be amended, supplemented, amended and restated, replaced, refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their terms and the obligations under the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations may be refinanced, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of the ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, all without affecting the lien priorities or other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that any such refinancing shall comply with the applicable provision of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and shall not contravene any provision of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to any amendment of any ABL Documents or refinancing of the Priority Lien Obligations. _Certain Matters in Connection with Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings_ Until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall be subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the ABL Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use of “Cash Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) constituting Current Asset Collateral on which the ABL Collateral Agent or any other creditor has a Lien or to permit the Issuer or any Guarantor to obtain financing to be secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, whether from the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations or any other Person under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law (“DIP Financing”), then each Parity Lien Representatives, on behalf of itself and the applicable holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that it will raise no objection to such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing so long as such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing meets the following requirements: (i) each Parity Lien Representative and the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the Cash Collateral use or the DIP Financing that are materially prejudicial to their interests in the Fixed Asset Collateral, and (ii) the terms of the DIP Financing (A) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order and (B) do not require that any Lien of the Parity Lien Representatives on the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or pari passu with any Lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing such DIP Financing. To the extent the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu 235 ----- with the Liens securing such DIP Financing which meets the requirements of clause (ii) above, each Parity Lien Representative will subordinate its Liens in the Current Asset Collateral to (1) the Liens thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto), (2) all adequate protection Liens thereon granted to the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, and (3) to any “carve out” therefrom for professional and United States trustee fees that has been agreed to by the ABL Collateral Agent, and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the ABL Collateral Agent or to the extent permitted by the applicable section of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement). The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides for a similar restriction on the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations to object to a proposed DIP Financing that would be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral or to the use of any Fixed Asset Collateral constituting cash collateral that has been approved by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent (acting at the written direction of the applicable holders provided pursuant to the Security Documents and Indenture to the extent the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent is the Notes Collateral Agent), provided that similar conditions with respect to the Current Asset Collateral and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations would be satisfied in connection therewith. Until the discharge of the Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Current Asset Collateral, without the prior written consent of the ABL Collateral Agent, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Foreign Collateral. The ABL Intercreditor Agreement provides for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations to seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledges and agrees in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that the grants of Liens pursuant to the ABL Security Documents and the Liens on Fixed Asset Collateral constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens, and because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral (it being understood that in accordance with the other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Real Estate Assets), the Parity Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Priority Lien Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the foregoing sentence, if it is held that the claims of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative Lien priority set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such Collateral, it being understood that in accordance with the other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral), then each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledge and agree that, subject to the Lien priority and application of proceeds provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Issuer and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Current Asset Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations), the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest, fees, expenses and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of post-petition interest, fees, and expenses, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the ABL Credit Agreement arising from or related to a default, whether or not a claim therefor is allowed or allowable in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Current Asset Collateral in respect of the claims held by the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, with each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Current Asset Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to a reciprocal provision with respect to distributions from the Fixed Asset 236 ----- Collateral and the potential turn over thereof to the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent by the holders of Priority Lien Obligations. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledge and agree in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement that no holder of Priority Lien Obligations nor any holder of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations (whether in the capacity of a secured creditor or an unsecured creditor) shall propose, vote for, or otherwise support directly or indirectly any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, if, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Issuer or a Guarantor, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed or reinstated (in whole or in part) pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, both on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and on account of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and on account of the Parity Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same property, the provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations. Subject to certain designated provisions of the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, each Parity Lien Representative agrees that it will consent, and will not object or oppose, or support any party in opposing, a motion to dispose of any Current Asset Collateral free and clear of any Liens or other claims under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law if the requisite holders of the Priority Lien Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement have consented to such disposition of the Current Asset Collateral, such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement, the rights of the Parity Lien Representatives under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law (so long as the right of any holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligation to offset its claim against the purchase price for any Current Asset Collateral exists only after the Priority Lien Obligations have been paid in full in cash and/or in such other form of consideration as may be agreed to by the holders of Priority Lien Obligations), and the terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for the respective Liens to attach to the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral that is the subject of such disposition, subject to the Lien priorities in the ABL Intercreditor Agreement and the other terms and conditions thereof. Each Parity Lien Representative further agrees that it will not oppose, or support any party in opposing, the right of the ABL Collateral Agent to credit bid under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, subject to the provision of the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to reciprocal restrictions on their ability to object to, or credit bid with respect to, any proposed sale of Fixed Asset Collateral. _Certain Covenants with Respect to the Collateral_ The Collateral will be pledged pursuant to the Security Documents, which will contain provisions relating to identification of the Collateral and the maintenance of perfected Liens thereon. The following is a summary of some of the covenants and provisions set forth in the Security Documents and the Indenture as they relate to the Collateral. _Maintenance of Collateral_ The Security Documents and/or the Indenture, subject to certain exceptions, will provide that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall maintain the Collateral in good, safe and insurable operating order, condition and repair (ordinary wear and tear excepted) and to do all other acts as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to maintain and preserve the Collateral. The Security Documents and/or the Indenture also will provide, subject to certain exceptions, that the Issuer and the Guarantors shall pay all real estate and other taxes (except such as are being contested in good faith and by appropriate negotiations or proceedings), and use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain in full force and effect all material permits and certain insurance coverages. _After-Acquired Property_ Upon the acquisition by any of the Issuer or the Guarantors after the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) of any assets (other than Excluded Assets), including, but not limited to, any real property that qualifies as Collateral or any equipment or fixtures which constitute accretions, 237 ----- additions or technological upgrades to the equipment or fixtures or any working capital assets that, in any such case, form part of the Collateral, the Issuer or such Guarantor shall execute and deliver (i) with regard to real property that qualifies as Collateral, the items described under “—Real Estate Mortgages and Filings” below within 90 days of the date of acquisition of the applicable asset (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the Term Loan Credit Agreement) and (ii) with regard to any other after-acquired property to the extent required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents, any information, documentation, financing statements or other certificates as may be necessary to vest in the Notes Collateral Agent a perfected security interest, with the priority required by the Indenture and the Security Documents, subject only to Permitted Liens and the Perfection Exceptions, in such after-acquired property and to have such after-acquired property added to the Collateral, and thereupon all provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents relating to the Collateral shall be deemed to relate to such after-acquired property to the same extent and with the same force and effect. _Further Assurances_ To the extent required under the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, the Issuer and the Guarantors shall execute any and all further documents, financing statements, agreements and instruments, and take all further actions that may be required under applicable law, or that the Notes Collateral Agent or the Trustee may reasonably request, in order to grant, preserve, protect and perfect the validity and priority of the security interests and Liens created or intended to be created by the Security Documents in the Collateral. In addition, to the extent required under the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, from time to time, the Issuer and the Guarantors will reasonably promptly secure the obligations under the Indenture and Security Documents by pledging or creating, or causing to be pledged or created, perfected security interests and Liens with respect to the Collateral to the extent required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents. _Impairment of Security Interest_ Neither Parent nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries will (i) take, or knowingly or negligently omit to take, any action which would materially adversely affect or impair the Liens in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent and the holders of Notes with respect to the Collateral unless such action or failure to take action is otherwise permitted by the Indenture or the Security Documents or (ii) grant any Person, or permit any Person to retain (other than the Notes Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent, the Term Loan Collateral Agent or the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents), any Liens on the Collateral, other than Permitted Liens. The Issuer and each Guarantor will, at its sole cost and expense, execute and deliver all such agreements and instruments as necessary, or as the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent reasonably requests, to more fully or accurately describe the assets and property intended to be Collateral or the Obligations intended to be secured by the Security Documents. _Real Estate Mortgages and Filings_ With respect to any fee interest in any Premises owned by the Issuer or a Guarantor on the Acquisition Closing Date (or on the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or acquired by the Issuer or a Guarantor after the Acquisition Closing Date (or after the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) that forms a part of the Collateral (but specifically excluding Excluded Assets), within 90 days of the Acquisition Closing Date (or of the Issue Date if the Acquisition closes on the Issue Date) or the date of acquisition, as applicable (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the Term Loan Credit Agreement) (in each case solely to the extent, and substantially in the form, delivered to the Term Loan Collateral Agent, but no greater scope): (1) the Issuer or such Guarantor shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent, as mortgagee or beneficiary, as applicable, for the ratable benefit of itself, the Trustee and the holders, fully executed counterparts of mortgages, debentures, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt or other similar security instruments (each, a “Mortgage”) in accordance with the requirements of the Indenture and/or the Security Documents, duly executed and acknowledged by the Issuer or such Guarantor, and otherwise in form for recording in the recording office of each applicable political subdivision where the Premises to be encumbered thereby is situated, together with such certificates, affidavits, questionnaires or returns as shall be reasonably required in connection with the recording or filing thereof and evidence of the completion (or satisfactory arrangements for the completion) of all recordings and filings of such Mortgage (and payment of any taxes or fees in connection therewith), together with any fixture filings, as may be necessary to create a valid, perfected Lien, with the priority required by the Indenture and the Security Documents, subject to Permitted Liens, against the Premises purported to be covered thereby; provided, however, to the 238 ----- extent any such Mortgage is to be filed in a jurisdiction that charges mortgage, intangibles or similar taxes in connection with the recording thereof, the amount to be secured by such Mortgage shall not be more than the Issuer’s reasonable estimate of the fair market value of such property; (2) the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received mortgagee’s title insurance policies (or a binding pro forma title insurance policy or marked-up unconditional binder of title insurance) in favor of the Notes Collateral Agent, and its successors and/or assigns, in the form necessary, with respect to the Premises purported to be covered by the applicable Mortgages, which shall insure that the Mortgages constitute a valid Lien on the applicable Premises, with the priority required by the Indenture and the Security Documents, free and clear of all Liens, defects and encumbrances, other than Permitted Liens. All such title policies shall be in amounts equal to the estimated fair market value of the Premises covered thereby as reasonably estimated by the Issuer or any Guarantor, and such policies shall also include, to the extent available, all such endorsements as shall be reasonably required in transactions of similar size and purpose to the extent available at commercially reasonable rates and shall be accompanied by evidence of the payment in full by the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor of all premiums thereon (or that satisfactory arrangements for such payment have been made) and that all charges for mortgage recording taxes, filing and recording fees and all related expenses, if any, have been paid; (3) if requested by the Term Loan Collateral Agent under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Notes Collateral Agent shall have received, and the title insurance company issuing the policy referred to in clause (2) above (the “Title Insurance Company”) shall have received an ALTA survey or other survey of the sites of the Premises in a manner customary for the type of real property subject to such survey, dated as of a date that is reasonably satisfactory to the Title Insurance Company by an independent professional licensed land surveyor reasonably satisfactory to the Title Insurance Company or, in lieu thereof, existing surveys, together with any affidavits or certificates required by the Title Insurance Company as shall be sufficient to enable the Title Insurance Company to remove any standard survey exceptions from the applicable title insurance policy and issue customary survey-dependent endorsements to the applicable title insurance policy; and (4) the Issuer or the Guarantors shall deliver to the Notes Collateral Agent customary local counsel opinions. _Foreclosure_ Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, but subject in all cases to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements, the Security Documents will provide for (among other available remedies) the sale of, or other realization upon, the applicable Collateral by the Notes Collateral Agent and the distribution, after payment of the outstanding fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent (including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees and expenses), of the net proceeds of any such sale to the holders of the Notes and other Parity Lien Indebtedness on a pro rata basis, subject to any prior Liens on the Collateral and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreements. In the event of realization on the Collateral, the proceeds from the sale of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy in full the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes. _Certain Bankruptcy Limitations_ In addition to the limitations described above, the right of the Notes Collateral Agent to obtain possession, exercise control over or dispose of the Collateral following an Event of Default would be significantly impaired (or at a minimum delayed) by applicable bankruptcy or other insolvency laws if the Issuer or any Guarantor were to have become a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar law or statute under debtor relief laws in any applicable jurisdiction) prior to the Notes Collateral Agent having obtained possession, exercised control over or disposed of the Collateral. For example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, are prohibited by the automatic stay from taking various actions in furtherance of debt collection, including obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, in each case without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code generally permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral (including cash collateral) owned as of the date of the bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, subject to certain protections afforded to a secured creditor (including the right to receive “adequate protection”). 239 ----- In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or at any point thereafter or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through adequate protection or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any Priority Lien Obligations, to the extent senior to the obligations in respect of the Notes or Parity Lien Indebtedness (including the obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement on the Current Asset Collateral)) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes would be “undersecured” and the holders of the Notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral and would hold unsecured claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of postpetition interest, costs, expenses and fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral on account of which payment or accrual of post-petition interest, costs, expenses and fees are sought (as well as any obligations secured by a senior lien on such Collateral). In addition, the Issuer or any Guarantor (or any trustee appointed therefor) or creditors of the Issuer or any Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Notes Collateral Agent, or the incurrence of obligations in respect of the Notes, as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, preference or otherwise under the Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law or any other applicable bankruptcy law. If such a challenge were successful, the Liens may be avoided, leaving the holders of the Notes with unsecured claims (or potentially no claims at all) against the applicable entities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness— Fraudulent transfer or fraudulent conveyance laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and/or the guarantees thereof (or the related security interests with respect to the Notes) and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.” _Information Regarding Collateral_ The Issuer will furnish to the Notes Collateral Agent, with respect to the Issuer or any Guarantor, written notice of any change in such Person’s (1) legal name, (2) jurisdiction of organization or formation, or (3) identity or corporate structure within 30 days of such change (or such later date as the Term Loan Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the Term Loan Credit Agreement with respect to Fixed Asset Collateral, or the ABL Collateral Agent may have agreed to under the ABL Credit Agreement with respect to Current Asset Collateral). Promptly upon the occurrence of any of the foregoing, the Issuer and the Guarantors will make all filings under the UCC and any other applicable laws that are required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents in order for the Collateral to be made subject to the Lien of the Notes Collateral Agent under the Indenture and/or the Security Documents in the manner and to the extent required by the Indenture or any of the Security Documents, and shall take all necessary action so that such Lien is perfected with the same priority as immediately prior to such change to the extent required by the Indenture and/or the Security Documents. The Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent an Officer’s Certificate attaching supplemental schedules required under the Security Documents to the extent required under and at the same time as similar supplemental schedules are delivered to the Term Loan Collateral Agent. _Refinancings of the Credit Agreements and the Existing Secured Notes_ The obligations under the Credit Agreements and the Existing Secured Indentures and the obligations under the Indenture and the Notes may be refinanced or replaced, in whole or in part, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent, the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any Notes (except to the extent a consent is otherwise required to permit the refinancing transaction under a Credit Agreement or any security document related thereto, under the Existing Secured Indentures or any security document related thereto or under the Indenture and the Security Documents), all without affecting the Lien priorities provided for in the Security Documents; provided, however, that the lenders providing or holders of any such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness (or an authorized agent or trustee on their behalf) bind themselves in writing to the terms of the applicable Intercreditor Agreements pursuant to a written agreement (including amendments or supplements to the applicable Intercreditor Agreements) as required by the Intercreditor Agreements. 240 ----- In addition, if at any time in connection with or after the discharge of Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations the Issuer enters into any (i) replacement of the Term Loan Credit Agreement secured by all or a portion of the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis or all or a portion of the Current Asset Collateral on a second-priority Lien basis, respectively, or (ii) any replacement of the ABL Credit Agreement secured by all or a portion of the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority Lien basis or all or a portion of the Fixed Asset Collateral on a second-priority Lien basis, respectively (and in each case, subject to Permitted Liens), then such prior discharge of Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, shall automatically be deemed not to have occurred for all purposes of the Intercreditor Agreements, the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the ABL Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Indentures, the Indenture and the Security Documents, and the Obligations under such replacement Term Loan Credit Agreement or replacement ABL Credit Agreement shall automatically be treated as Term Loan Obligations or Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, for all purposes of the Intercreditor Agreements, including for purposes of the Lien priorities and rights in respect of the Fixed Asset Collateral or Current Asset Collateral (or, in each case, such portion thereof) set forth therein. Notwithstanding any replacement or refinancing of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the ABL Credit Agreement or the entering into of a new Term Loan Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement (whether or not such replacement or refinancing of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or the ABL Credit Agreement, as applicable, immediately follows any prior discharge of the Term Loan Credit Agreement or ABL Credit Agreement previously in existence), the Notes and the Note Guarantees shall be, in addition to being secured by the other Collateral, secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral or the Current Asset Collateral, as applicable (it being understood that during the period the Term Loan Credit Agreement is not in existence that the Notes and the Note Guarantees will continue to be secured by a first-priority Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Fixed Asset Collateral and a second-priority Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Current Asset Collateral, and during the period the ABL Credit Agreement is not in existence that the Notes and the Note Guarantees will be secured by a first-priority Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Current Asset Collateral and will continue to be secured by a first-priority Lien, subject to Permitted Liens, on all of the Fixed Asset Collateral). In connection with any refinancing or replacement contemplated by the foregoing paragraphs, the Intercreditor Agreements may be amended at the request and sole expense of the Issuer, and without the consent of the Term Loan Collateral Agent, the ABL Collateral Agent (if applicable), the Existing Secured Notes Collateral Agents, the Notes Collateral Agent or the holder of any Notes, (a) to add parties (or any authorized agent or trustee therefor) providing any such refinancing or replacement indebtedness in compliance with the Credit Agreements, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture and (b) to establish that Liens on any Collateral securing such refinancing or replacement Indebtedness shall have the same priority (or junior priority) or, if the Credit Agreements, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Indenture so permit, senior priority, as the Liens on any Collateral securing the Indebtedness being refinanced or replaced, all on the terms provided for in the Indenture and the Security Documents immediately prior to such refinancing or replacement.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

If this offering closes prior to consummation of the Acquisition, concurrently with the closing of the offering of the Notes on the Issue Date, the Escrow Issuer will enter into an Escrow Agreement with the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, pursuant to which the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) (i) the gross proceeds from the sale of the Dollar Notes into the Dollar Escrow Account (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, the “Dollar Escrowed Funds”) and (ii) the gross proceeds of the sale of the Euro Notes into the Euro Escrow Account (together with any earnings thereon and investments thereof, collectively, the “Euro _Escrowed Funds” and, together with the Dollar Escrowed Funds, the “Escrowed Funds”). The Escrow Issuer will_ grant the Trustee (i) for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Dollar Notes, a first-priority security interest in the Dollar Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations under the Dollar Notes and (ii) for the benefit of itself, the Escrow Agent and the holders of the Euro Notes, a firstpriority security interest in the Euro Escrow Account and all deposits and investments therein to secure the Obligations under the Euro Notes, in each case, pending disbursement as described below. Upon a Special Mandatory Redemption, the Escrow Issuer will be required to fund the accrued and unpaid interest (and accretion, if any) owing to the holders of each Series of Notes to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, plus the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. Prior to the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will have very limited assets other than the Escrowed Funds and the escrowed proceeds of the offering of the Notes and no operations. The Escrowed Funds will be limited to the gross proceeds from this offering of the Notes. As a result, an affiliate of Platinum will issue an irrevocable equity commitment letter (the “Equity Commitment Letter”) to the Escrow Issuer, for the benefit of the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and 241 ----- the holders of the Notes, that will require such affiliate of Platinum, (x) in the event that any interest is payable on an interest payment date occurring prior to the satisfaction of the Escrow Release Conditions (as defined below), to transfer an amount of cash in U.S. dollars, in the case of the Dollar Notes, or euro, in the case of the Euro Notes, to the Escrow Issuer that is sufficient to fund the accrued and unpaid interest owing to the holders of such Notes and (y) upon receipt of a notice of a Special Mandatory Redemption, to transfer an amount of cash to the Escrow Issuer that will be sufficient, after taking into account the Escrowed Funds at such time, to fund the redemption of the Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon and the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Escrow Agent. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date or upon the occurrence of certain other events, the Notes will be subject to a special mandatory redemption, and, as a result, you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes.” The Escrow Issuer will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Funds in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will release the Escrowed Funds (the “Escrow Release”) to the Escrow Issuer (the date of such Escrow Release being referred to as the “Acquisition Closing Date”) upon the presentation by the Escrow Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to March 15, 2024 (the “Outside Date”), certifying that (a) the Acquisition will be consummated in accordance in all material respects with the Acquisition Agreement (without waiver or amendment of the Acquisition Agreement that is, in the aggregate when taken as a whole, in the reasonable opinion of the Escrow Issuer, materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes; provided that, (1) no reduction in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes, (2) no increase in the acquisition consideration shall be deemed to be materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes if such increase is not funded with additional long-term Indebtedness (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, borrowings under the ABL Credit Agreement), and (3) no modification to the acquisition consideration as a result of any purchase price adjustment or working capital adjustment expressly contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement as of the date hereof shall constitute a reduction or increase in the acquisition consideration) and (b) the Ultimate Issuer and the Guarantors will (i) become parties to the Indenture by means of a supplemental indenture effective upon the date of the Escrow Release and (ii) will become parties to the Purchase Agreement by means of a joinder agreement (the “Escrow Release Conditions”).

If the Escrow Agent (i) has not received an Officer’s Certificate at or prior to 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Outside Date or (ii) has received an escrow termination notice from the Escrow Issuer prior to the Outside Date, then the Escrow Agent promptly after 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Outside Date or the date on which it has received an escrow termination notice (as applicable) shall liquidate the Escrowed Funds and, on or prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, release (x) an amount of Escrowed Funds to the Trustee equal to the Special Mandatory Redemption Price and (y) after payment of any amounts due and owing to the Trustee or the Escrow Agent, any remaining amount of Escrowed Funds to the Escrow Issuer. No provisions of the Escrow Agreement (including, without limitation, those relating to the release of the Escrowed Funds) may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes without the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding. For purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have consented to or voted in favor of any such waiver or modification, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Notes shall be calculated by the Issuer using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such other services as may be selected by the Issuer in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such waiver or modification. To the extent such provisions relate to the Escrow Issuer’s obligation to redeem the Notes in a Special Mandatory Redemption, no provisions of the Indenture may be waived or modified in any manner materially adverse to the holders of the Notes without the written consent of all holders of the Notes.

If such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, such notice shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned upon the occurrence of such Change of Control and shall describe such condition, and, if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s sole discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 90 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such repurchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the paying agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions of Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of Notes being purchased by the Issuer. The paying agent will promptly deliver to each holder of Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each holder a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any. The Issuer will announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. 249 ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, (2) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, the Issuer (or any Affiliate of the Issuer) or a third party has made an offer to purchase at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Alternate Offer, or (3) notice of redemption has been given to the Trustee pursuant to the Indenture as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control and/or conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, to any Person other than one or more Permitted Holders. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Notes to require the Issuer to repurchase its Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—Holders of the Notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the Notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.” The occurrence of a Change of Control under the Indenture may also constitute a default under the Credit Agreements that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. As a result, following a Change of Control, the Issuer may not be able to repurchase the Notes unless all indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreements is first repaid and any other Indebtedness that contains similar provisions is repaid, or we obtain a waiver from the holders of such indebtedness to provide the Issuer with sufficient cash to repurchase the Notes. In addition, the Existing Notes have similar requirements regarding the Issuer’s obligation to offer to purchase such Existing Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control.

For purposes of this provision, each of the following will be deemed to be cash: (a) any liabilities (as shown on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s most recent balance sheet or in the footnotes thereto for which internal financial statements are available) of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary (or, if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on Parent’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet 250 ----- (or in the footnotes thereto) (other than liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the Notes or any Note Guarantee)) that are assumed by the transferee with respect to the applicable disposition and for which Parent and the Restricted Subsidiaries shall have been validly released by all applicable creditors in writing, (b) any securities, notes, other obligations or assets received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are convertible by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of the applicable Asset Sale; (c) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Sale having an aggregate Fair Market Value, taken together with all other Designated Noncash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c) that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of (x) $390.0 million and (y) 30.0% of Consolidated EBITDA; (d) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary that is not Subordinated Indebtedness received from such transferee; and (e) accounts receivable of a business retained by Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, following the sale of such business; provided that such accounts receivable (1) are not past due more than 90 days and (2) do not have a payment date greater than 120 days from the date of the invoices creating such accounts receivable; (3) to the extent that any consideration received by Parent (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) in such Asset Sale constitutes property or other assets that are of a type or class that constitutes Fixed Asset Collateral, such property or other assets are added to the Fixed Asset Collateral securing the Notes in the manner and to the extent required by the Indenture or any of the Security Documents; and (4) Parent or such Restricted Subsidiary has complied with the applicable provisions of the Indenture and the Security Documents. Within 450 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may apply such Net Proceeds at its option: (1) (i) to repay Priority Lien Obligations of Parent, the Issuer or any Guarantor (including Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement) and, if such Priority Lien Obligations being repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto or (ii) if the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, to repay any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is not a Guarantor; (2) to repay (i) Parity Lien Indebtedness, including the Notes, the Term Loan Obligations and the Existing Secured Notes or (ii) if the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, unsecured Indebtedness and other unsecured obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor that rank pari passu with the Notes or such Guarantor’s Note Guarantee (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries); provided that if Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) shall so reduce Indebtedness other than the Notes, the Issuer shall equally and ratably redeem or repurchase the Notes as described above under “—Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions at market prices (which may be below par), or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all holders to purchase the Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to (but not including) the date of repayment; (3) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, a Permitted Business, if, (a) after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent or additional Capital Stock of an existing non-Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary and (b) in the case of any such acquisition of assets, to the extent the assets are of the type that would constitute Collateral, such assets are thereupon added to the Collateral following their acquisition; (4) to make a capital expenditure; 251 ----- (5) to make an investment in any one or more businesses or property, plant or equipment or acquire property, plant or equipment, in each case that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; provided that (a) to the extent that such investment, property, plant or equipment are of the type that would constitute Collateral, such investment, property, plant or equipment is thereupon added to the Collateral following such investment or acquisition and (b) such investment is made in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; or (6) any combination of the foregoing. Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) will be deemed to have complied with the provisions set forth in clause (3), (4), (5) or (6) of the preceding paragraph if, (i) within 450 days after the Asset Sale that generated the Net Proceeds, Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) has entered into and not abandoned or rejected a binding agreement to make an investment or payment in compliance with the provisions described in the immediately preceding paragraph, and that investment or payment is thereafter completed within 180 days after the end of such 450-day period or (ii) in the event such binding agreement described in the preceding clause (i) is cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, Parent (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) enters into another such binding commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or termination of the prior binding commitment; provided that if any second binding commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied within 180 days of such second binding commitment, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent a distribution of any or all of the Net Proceeds of any Asset Sales by a Foreign Subsidiary to Parent or another Restricted Subsidiary of Parent (i) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, rule or regulation, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other organizational or administrative impediments from being repatriated to the United States or (ii) would have a material adverse tax consequence, as reasonably determined by the Issuer, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Proceeds so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant; _provided that if at any time within one year following the date on which such amount would otherwise have been_ required to be applied pursuant to this covenant, distribution of any of such affected Net Proceeds is no longer prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, rule or regulation, restricted by any applicable organizational document or agreement, subject to other organizational or administrative impediment from being repatriated to the United States, and would not result in a material adverse tax consequences, then an amount equal to such amount of Net Proceeds so permitted to be repatriated will be promptly applied (net of any taxes, costs or expenses that would be payable or reserved against if such amounts were actually repatriated, whether or not they are repatriated) in compliance with this covenant. To the extent that the Net Proceeds of an Asset Sale are attributable to a non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary, the amount of such Net Proceeds required to be applied in compliance with this covenant shall not exceed the lesser of (x) an amount corresponding to the proportionate ownership interests in such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary or (y) an amount corresponding to the amount of distributions permitted to be made from such non-Wholly Owned Subsidiary to its direct or indirect parent entity that is a Wholly Owned Subsidiary for such purposes at the time such prepayment is required to be made. The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Indenture shall be construed to require Parent or any Foreign Subsidiary to repatriate cash or to apply any Net Proceeds described in clause (i) above in compliance with this covenant in the event that such repatriation is not permitted under applicable local law, rule or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediment within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required. Pending the final application of any such amount of Net Proceeds, Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary may temporarily reduce Indebtedness under a revolving credit facility, if any, or otherwise invest or utilize such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture and the Security Documents. Any Net Proceeds that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant (but excluding for the avoidance of doubt any such proceeds not required to be applied or invested as a result of the fourth paragraph of this covenant) will constitute “Excess Proceeds”; provided that any amount of proceeds offered to holders in accordance with clause (2) of the second paragraph of this covenant or pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer (as defined below) made at any time after the Asset Sale shall be deemed to have been applied as required and shall not be deemed to be Excess Proceeds without regard to the extent to which such offer is accepted by the holders. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of (x) $325.0 million and (y) 25.0% of Consolidated EBITDA, within 30 days thereof, the Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of the Notes, any other Parity Lien Indebtedness (if required by the terms thereof) and, if the assets or property disposed of in the Asset Sale were not Collateral, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is not a Guarantor (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or 252 ----- a Restricted Subsidiary) and/or unsecured Indebtedness and other unsecured Obligations of the Issuer or a Guarantor that rank pari passu with the Notes (other than Indebtedness owed to Parent or a Restricted Subsidiary) that, in each case, contains provisions similar to those set forth in the Indenture with respect to offers to purchase, prepay or redeem with the proceeds of sales of assets, to purchase, prepay or redeem on a pro rata basis the maximum principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and such other Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of such Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer, in the case of the Notes, will be equal to 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the Notes repurchased, to (but not including) the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Notes on a relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date occurring on or prior to the purchase date, and will be payable in cash. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to such Excess Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds at any time prior to the expiration of the application period or by electing to make an Asset Sale Offer with respect to such Excess Proceeds. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer (any such amount, “Retained _Declined Proceeds”), the Issuer may use those Retained Declined Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited_ by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and other pari passu Indebtedness, as applicable, tendered in (or required to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Issuer will select the Notes, Parity Lien Indebtedness and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed and thereafter the Trustee will select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis (subject to the procedures of DTC or of Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, with respect to the global notes) based on the principal amount tendered (with, in each case, such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Issuer so that only Notes in minimum denominations of (i) in the case of Dollar Notes, $200,000, or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and (ii) in the case of Euro Notes, €100,000, or an integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof, in each case, will be purchased; provided that any unpurchased portion of a Note must be in a minimum denomination of (i) in the case of Dollar Notes, $200,000 or (ii) in the case of Euro Notes, €100,000. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. The agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Credit Agreements, the Existing Secured Indentures and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, contain, and future agreements may contain, prohibitions of certain events, including events that would constitute a Change of Control or an Asset Sale. The exercise by the holders of Notes, the holders of Existing Secured Notes and holders of Existing Unsecured Notes of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes, the Existing Secured Notes and Existing Unsecured Notes, respectively, upon a Change of Control or an Asset Sale could cause a default under these other agreements, even if the Change of Control or Asset Sale itself does not cause a default, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a Change of Control or Asset Sale occurs at a time when the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing Notes, Existing Secured Notes or Existing Unsecured Notes, we could seek the consent of lenders under the Credit Agreements or such other Indebtedness to the purchase of Notes, Existing Secured Notes or Existing Unsecured Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, the Issuer will remain prohibited from purchasing Notes, Existing Secured Notes or Existing Unsecured Notes. In that case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes, Existing Secured Notes and Existing Unsecured Notes would constitute an Existing Event of Default under the Indenture, and will constitute an event of default under the Existing Secured Indentures and the Existing Unsecured Indenture, respectively, which could, in turn, constitute a default under the Credit Agreements and such other Indebtedness. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of Notes, the holders of the Existing Secured Notes and the holders of Existing Unsecured Notes upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s then existing financial resources. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and Our Indebtedness—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control or pursuant to an asset sale offer.” Because the Obligations under the ABL Credit Agreement are secured by the Current Asset Collateral, and since the definition of “Net Proceeds” excludes all amounts in respect of any Asset Sale that are used to repay any 253 ----- Indebtedness that is secured by property or assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale, it is unlikely that any meaningful amount of Net Proceeds will be generated from any Asset Sale of Current Asset Collateral so long as the ABL Credit Agreement remains outstanding. The Issuer’s obligation to make an Asset Sale Offer may be waived or modified or terminated with the written consent of the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes) prior to the date by which the Issuer is required to make such Asset Sale Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, the failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during the Suspension Period (as defined below) (including any action taken or omitted to be taken with respect thereto and including any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligations arising during the Suspension Period) will not give rise to a Default or Event of Default under the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the applicable Series of Notes no longer have an Investment Grade Rating from both of the Ratings Agencies, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline (any such date, a “Reversion Date”). The period of time between the suspension of covenants as set forth above and the Reversion Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” All Indebtedness incurred (including Acquired Debt) and Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued during the Suspension Period will be 254 ----- deemed to have been incurred or issued in reliance on the exception provided by clause (2) of the definition of “Permitted Debt.” Calculations under the reinstated “Restricted Payments” covenant will be made as if the “Restricted Payments” covenant had been in effect prior to, but not during, the period that the “Restricted Payments” covenant was suspended as set forth above. For purposes of determining compliance with the covenant described above under “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” the Excess Proceeds from all Asset Sales not applied in accordance with such covenant will be deemed to be reset to zero after the Reversion Date. In addition, for purposes of the covenant described under “— Transactions with Affiliates,” all agreements and arrangements entered into by Parent and any Restricted Subsidiary with an Affiliate of Parent during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (12) of the second paragraph of “— Transactions with Affiliates,” and for purposes of the covenant described under “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” all contracts entered into during the Suspension Period prior to such Reversion Date that contain any of the restrictions contemplated by such covenant will be deemed to have been entered pursuant to clause (1) of the second paragraph of “—Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries.” During the Suspension Period, any reference in the definition of “Unrestricted Subsidiary” to the covenant described under “—Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock” or any provision thereof shall be construed as if such covenant had remained in effect since the Issue Date and during the Suspension Period. Upon the Reversion Date, the obligation to grant Note Guarantees pursuant to the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees” will be reinstated (and the Reversion Date will be deemed to be the date on which any guaranteed Indebtedness was incurred for purposes of the covenant described under “—Future Guarantees”). Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred as a result of any failure to comply with the Suspended Covenants during any Suspension Period and Parent and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted, without causing a Default or Event of Default or breach of any of the Suspended Covenants (notwithstanding the reinstatement thereof) under the Indenture with respect to the applicable Series of Notes, to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual commitments or obligations following a Reversion Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby; provided that such contractual commitments or obligations were entered into during the Suspension Period and not in contemplation of a reversion of the Suspended Covenants; provided, further, that, to the extent any such commitment or obligation results in the making of a Restricted Payment, such Restricted Payment shall be made under clause (c) of the first paragraph or under the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” and, if not permitted by any of such provisions, such Restricted Payment shall be deemed permitted under clause (c) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Restricted Payments” and shall be deducted for purposes of calculating the amount pursuant to such clause (c) (which may not be less than zero). The Issuer shall provide an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee indicating the occurrence of any Suspension Period or Reversion Date.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness or any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in clauses (1) through (36) above, or is entitled to be incurred or issued as Ratio Debt, the Issuer will be permitted to classify, divide or reclassify such item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock on the date of determination or its incurrence or issuance, or later reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, in any manner that complies with this covenant; provided that Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under the Term Loan Credit Agreement outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been incurred in reliance on the exception provided by clause (1)(a) of the definition of “Permitted Debt” and may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on preferred stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of preferred stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant or the covenant set forth under “—Liens”; provided, in each such case, that the amount thereof shall be included in Fixed Charges of Parent as accrued. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar- denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness or the issuance of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving or delayed draw Indebtedness, or first issued, in the case of Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, or, in each case, at the option of the borrower or issuer of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock, the date on which the rate of interest and other pricing terms of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock are determined or the date of determination; provided, that if such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued to Refinance other Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock denominated in a foreign currency (or in a different currency from such Indebtedness so being incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being issued), and such refinancing would cause the applicable clauses of the definition of 267 ----- “Permitted Debt” (or categories of Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” (or categories of Permitted Liens) measured by a dollar amount or by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Indebtedness or liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed (i) the outstanding or, in the case of revolving Indebtedness, committed, principal amount of such Indebtedness or the liquidation preference of such Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being Refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of Additional Refinancing Amounts incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock that Parent or any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent may incur or issue pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. For purposes of calculating any ratio-based basket, with respect to any revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw facility or other committed debt financing incurred under such ratio-based basket, Parent may elect (which election may not be changed with respect to such Indebtedness), at any time, to either (x) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness, in which case such committed amount may thereafter be borrowed or reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, without further compliance with any ratio-based component of any provision of the Indenture, or (y) give pro forma effect to the incurrence of the actual amount drawn under such revolving Indebtedness, delayed draw facility or other committed debt financing, in which case, the ability to incur the amounts committed to under such Indebtedness will be subject to such ratio-based basket (to the extent being incurred pursuant to such ratio) at the time of each such incurrence. For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount or liquidation preference, as applicable, of any particular Indebtedness incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant, if any commitments in respect of revolving or deferred draw Indebtedness are established in reliance on any clause of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, at the Issuer’s option, on the date of the initial borrowing of such Indebtedness or entry into the definitive agreement providing the commitment to fund such Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the incurrence of the entire committed amount of such Indebtedness (such committed amount, a “Grower Tested Committed Amount”) may thereafter be borrowed and reborrowed, in whole or in part, from time to time, irrespective of whether or not such incurrence would cause such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded and such Grower Tested Committed Amount shall be deemed outstanding pursuant to such basket so long as such commitments are in effect. If any Indebtedness is incurred or any Disqualified Stock or preferred stock is issued to Refinance Indebtedness (or unutilized commitments in respect of Indebtedness) initially incurred (or established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued (or to Refinance Indebtedness incurred (or commitments established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock issued) to Refinance Indebtedness initially incurred (or commitments initially established) or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock initially issued in reliance on any clause or clauses of the definition of “Permitted Debt” measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or a ratio-based basket at the time of incurrence or issuance, and such refinancing would cause such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA to be exceeded or ratio to be unmet if calculated on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or ratio shall not be deemed to be exceeded or unmet (and such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock shall be deemed permitted) so long as the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the principal amount or liquidation preference of such Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being Refinanced, plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding anything in the Indenture to the contrary, unless the Issuer elects otherwise, if, on any date, Parent or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any transaction or series of related transactions (A) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock as permitted by a ratio-based or ratio-referent clause or provision and (B) incurs Indebtedness or issues Disqualified Stock or preferred stock under a non-ratiobased or non-ratio-referent clause or provision, then the applicable ratio will be calculated on such date with respect to any incurrence under the applicable ratio-based or ratio referent clause or provision without giving effect to the incurrence under such non-ratio-based or non-ratio-referent clause or provision made in connection with such transaction or series of related transactions. If Indebtedness originally incurred or Disqualified Stock or preferred stock originally issued in reliance upon a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA or the Ratio Incremental Amount under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant is being refinanced under such clause (1) and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock thereunder to be exceeded at such time, 268 ----- then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock will be deemed to have been incurred, and permitted to be incurred, under such clause (1) so long as the principal amount or the liquidation preference of such refinancing Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock does not exceed an amount equal to the principal amount or liquidation preference of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or preferred stock being refinanced plus Additional Refinancing Amounts in connection with such refinancing. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be: (1) the accreted value of the Indebtedness, in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount; (2) the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; and (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the lesser of: (a) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (b) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, failure by the Issuer to comply with any of its obligations hereunder for purposes of clause (3) under “—Events of Default and Remedies” will not constitute an Event of Default thereunder until 120 days after the receipt of the written notice delivered thereunder. To the extent any information is not provided within the time periods specified in this covenant and such information is subsequently provided, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured.

In the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, with respect to either Parent, any Restricted Subsidiary of Parent that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Restricted Subsidiaries of Parent that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, or the Issuer, all outstanding Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer (with a copy to the Trustee if given by holders of Notes) may declare all the Notes to be due and payable immediately. Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, for purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have directed the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, the U.S. dollar equivalent of the principal amount of the Euro Notes shall be calculated by the Trustee or its agent using the exchange rate as provided on the applicable Reuters screen (or such other services as may be selected by the Trustee or its agent in its discretion) at approximately 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the date that is two business days prior to the date of such direction. The Trustee shall have no liability for making such calculation. The Trustee may withhold from holders of the Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, and interest, if any, on the Notes. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing as a result of the acceleration of any Indebtedness described in clause (4) under the first paragraph of “— Events of Default and Remedies” (excluding any resulting payment default under the Indenture or the Notes), the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if such Indebtedness is paid or otherwise acquired or retired or the holders of all Indebtedness described in clause (4) have rescinded or waived the declaration of acceleration in respect of such Indebtedness within 20 business days of the date of such declaration of acceleration of the Notes, and if the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, and all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of principal or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived and all amounts owing to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent have been paid. The Indenture will provide that if a Default is deemed to occur solely as a consequence of the existence of another Default (the “Initial Default”), then, at the time such Initial Default is cured, the Default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action. In case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of Notes unless such holders have offered and, if requested, provided to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee and/or Notes Collateral Agent against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest, if any, when due, no holder of a Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes (subject to the Intercreditor Agreements) unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 282 ----- (2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holder or holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee and/or the Notes Collateral Agent security and/or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee does not comply with such request within 60 days after receipt of the notice, request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) during such 60-day period, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request. The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may, on behalf of the holders of all of the Notes, rescind an acceleration or waive any existing Default or Event of Default and its consequences under the Indenture, if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium on, if any, or interest, if any, on, the Notes (except nonpayment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes). Any notice of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Default, notice of acceleration or take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more holders (other than any holder that is a Regulated Bank, an initial purchaser or its Affiliate (in each case, as evidenced by delivery of an officer’s certificate to the Trustee from such initial purchaser or Affiliate certifying as to its status as an initial purchaser or Affiliate thereof)) (each a “Directing Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such holder is not (or, in the case such holder is DTC, the Common Depositary or any of their respective nominees, that such holder is being instructed solely by beneficial owners that have represented to such holder that they are not) Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Default, shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the notes are accelerated. In addition, each Directing Holder is deemed at the time of providing a Noteholder Direction to covenant to provide the Issuer with such other information as the Issuer may reasonably request from time to time in order to verify the accuracy of such noteholder’s Position Representation within five business days of request therefor (a “Verification _Covenant”). In any case in which the holder is DTC, the Common Depositary or any of their respective nominees,_ any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the notes in lieu of DTC, the Common Depositary or any of their respective nominees and DTC and the Common Depositary, as applicable, shall be entitled to conclusively rely on such Position Representation and Verification Covenant in delivering its direction to the Trustee. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate that the Issuer has instituted litigation with a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed until such time as the Issuer provides the Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied; provided that the Issuer shall promptly deliver such Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee upon becoming aware that the Verification Covenant has been satisfied. Any breach of the Position Representation (as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Trustee) shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio, with the effect that such Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default; provided, however, this shall 283 ----- not invalidate any indemnity or security provided by the Directing Holders to the Trustee which obligations shall continue to survive. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of bankruptcy or similar proceedings shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing two paragraphs shall not apply to any holder that is a Regulated Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction, Position Representation, Verification Covenant, Officer’s Certificate or other document delivered to it pursuant to the foregoing paragraphs, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Regulated Banks, Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action or staying any remedy. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction or to determine whether any holder has delivered a Position Representation or that such Position Representation conforms with the Indenture or any other agreement or whether or not any holder is a Regulated Bank. With their acquisition of the Notes, each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes consents to the delivery of its Position Representation by the Trustee to the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this provision. Each holder and subsequent purchaser of the Notes waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction. Other than in connection with actions resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Trustee, the Issuer waives any and all claims, in law and/or in equity, against the Trustee, and agrees not to commence any legal proceeding against the Trustee in respect of, and agrees that the Trustee will not be liable for any action that the Trustee takes in accordance with this provision, or arising out of or in connection with following instructions or taking actions in accordance with a Noteholder Direction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee will treat all holders equally with respect to their rights under this “Events of Default and Remedies” provision. In connection with the requisite percentages required under the Indenture to exercise remedies, the Trustee shall be entitled to treat all outstanding Notes equally irrespective of any Position Representation in determining whether the requisite percentage has been obtained with respect to the initial delivery of the Noteholder Direction. The Issuer agrees that any and all other actions that the Trustee takes or omits to take in connection with the foregoing net short language and all fees, costs and expenses of the Trustee and its agents and counsel arising as a result of, or in connection with, the application of such provision shall be covered by the Issuer’s indemnification obligations set forth in the Indenture. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee annually an Officer’s Certificate regarding compliance with the Indenture within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year (commencing with the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023). Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days of becoming aware of such Default or Event of Default (unless such Default or Event of Default has been cured or waived within such 30 day period), an Officer’s Certificate specifying such Default or Event of Default, its status and what action the Issuer or any Guarantor propose to take with respect thereto.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

None of us, the Trustee, the paying agent, the registrar, the transfer agent or the initial purchasers take any responsibility for these operations or procedures and we urge investors to contact DTC or its participants directly to discuss these matters. All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable. The Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by DTC and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, the Trustee, the paying agent, the transfer agent, the registrar nor any of our or their respective agents are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC advised the Issuer that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing 336 ----- agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement amongst direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations, they also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the Rule 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

In addition, because of time zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Notes, on a particular day, may 337 ----- find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or in Brussels if Euroclear is used. 338 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be done only through, records maintained in the book-entry form by DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream and their respective participants, as applicable. The Book-Entry Interests in Global Notes will only be issued in minimum denominations of $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) and minimum denominations of €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof (in the case of the Euro Notes).

Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive certificated form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.

Effect of Certain Contingencies",327.1.1,Effect of Escrow Release and Related Transactions,"As described in “Description of Notes,” if this offering closes prior to the consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will deposit (or cause to be deposited) the gross proceeds from the sale of the Notes into separate segregated escrow accounts, which will be released and used as part of the financing for the Transactions and for the other purposes described further in “Use of Proceeds.” As part of consummation of the Acquisition, the Escrow Issuer will merge with and into the Ultimate Issuer, with the Ultimate Issuer ultimately continuing as the surviving entity and assuming the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture. Although the issue is not free from doubt, we intend to take the position, and the remainder of this discussion assumes, that the transactions that will occur in connection with the Escrow Release of the offering proceeds and the Escrow Merger should not result in a taxable event to holders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If this position is respected, a holder subject to U.S. federal income taxation would not recognize any income, gain or loss in connection with such transactions. It is possible, however, that the IRS could take a contrary view and seek to treat such holders as exchanging the Notes for “new” Notes in a deemed taxable exchange for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS successfully asserted that position, such holders would be required to recognize any gain or loss in connection with such exchange and would have a new holding period and a new tax basis in the “new” Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In addition, such “new” Notes may have OID.

These obligations may implicate the provisions of Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” Although the issue is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Our determination will be binding on a holder unless such holder explicitly discloses on a statement attached to the holder’s U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the Notes that such holder’s determination is different. Our determination, however, is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS successfully challenges this position, and the Notes are treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of such contingencies, holders subject to U.S. federal income taxation might, among other things, be required to accrue interest income on the Notes at a higher rate than the stated rate of interest on the Notes and to treat any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a Note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain.

U.S. Holders of Euro Notes will be subject to additional rules relating to the receipt of foreign currency. A U.S. Holder of Euro Notes that uses the cash method of tax accounting will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the euro-denominated interest payment on the Euro Notes (including any amounts received upon the Disposition (as defined below) of a Euro Note that are attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest) based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars on such date. Such a cash-method U.S. Holder generally will not recognize foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment on the Euro Notes. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will accrue interest income on the Euro Notes in euros and translate the amount accrued into U.S. dollars based on: - The average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period, or portion thereof within the taxable year, in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year; or - At such U.S. Holder’s election, the spot rate of exchange on (1) the last day of the accrual period, or in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year, the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year, or (2) the date of receipt, if such date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. Such election must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and can be changed only with the consent of the IRS.

Subject to the discussion of foreign currency gain or loss with respect to Euro Notes below, any gain or loss 341 ----- will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the Disposition and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by non-corporate U.S. Holders, including individuals, generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Dollar Note generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. Holder paid for the Dollar Note. A U.S. Holder’s tax basis in a Euro Note will generally be the U.S. dollar value of the euro purchase price, as applicable, calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase. If there is a Disposition of a Euro Note for an amount denominated in euro, a U.S. Holder’s amount realized generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the euro received in such Disposition (less any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as interest to the extent not previously included in taxable income), calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on the date of the Disposition. If the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market (as determined under applicable Treasury regulations), a cash-method U.S. Holder is required to determine the U.S. dollar value of the euro received in such Disposition by translating the euro received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the Disposition, and an accrualmethod U.S. Holder may elect the same treatment for the euro received. This election by accrual-method U.S. Holders must be applied consistently by the U.S. Holder to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder may recognize foreign currency gain or loss upon the Disposition of a Euro Note as a result of fluctuations in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate. Gain or loss attributable to such fluctuations will equal the difference (if any) between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price of the Euro Note, determined using the spot rate of exchange on the date the U.S. Holder acquired the Euro Note, and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s purchase price in euro of the Euro Note, determined using the spot rate of exchange on the date of the Disposition of the Euro Note (or, possibly in the case of a cash-method U.S. Holder or an electing accrual-method U.S. Holder, if the Euro Notes are traded on an established securities market (as determined under applicable Treasury regulations), the spot rates of exchange on the settlement date of such Disposition). The foreign currency gain or loss (together with any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to accrued but unpaid stated interest) will be recognized only to the extent of the total gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the Disposition of the Euro Note.

An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under proposed Treasury regulations, gross proceeds from a Disposition of Notes (including a retirement or redemption of Notes) are not subject to FATCA withholding.

The effects of U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal income tax laws, such as estate and gift tax laws, and any applicable state, local or non-U.S. tax laws are not discussed. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions, and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the IRS, in each case in effect as of the date hereof. These authorities may change or be subject to differing interpretations. Any such change or differing interpretation may be applied retroactively in a manner that could adversely affect a holder. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS regarding the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance the IRS or a court will not take a position contrary to that discussed below regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes. This discussion is limited to Notes held as “capital assets” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). In addition, this discussion is limited to Notes purchased for cash at original issue and at their “issue price” within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (i.e., the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to investors for cash (other than sales to bond houses, brokers, or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents, or wholesalers)). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax consequences relevant to a holder’s particular circumstances, including the impact of the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the impact of the requirement under Section 451(b) of the Code on certain holders to conform the timing of income accruals with respect to the Notes to such holders’ applicable financial statements. In addition, it does not address consequences relevant to holders subject to special rules, including, without limitation: - former U.S. citizens or former long-term residents of the United States; - persons subject to the alternative minimum tax; - U.S. Holders (as defined herein) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; - U.S. Holders that hold their Notes through non-U.S. brokers or other non-U.S. intermediaries; - persons holding Notes as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment; - banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; - real estate investment trusts or regulated investment companies; - brokers, dealers or traders in securities or currencies; - traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings; - “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax; - entities or arrangements treated as partnerships or S corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and investors therein); - tax-exempt entities or governmental entities; and - persons deemed to sell Notes under the constructive sale provisions of the Code. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of such partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. Accordingly, any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes considering an investment in the Notes and the partners in such partnership should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences to them. 339 -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.1,General Fiduciary Matters,107.1.1,,"ERISA and the Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries of a Plan subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) and prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan and its fiduciaries or other interested parties. Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the Notes should consult with its counsel regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such acquisition and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or whether an exemption would be applicable to any such purchase of Notes. In considering an investment in the Notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws. Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Issuer, the initial purchasers, any Guarantors or any of their respective affiliates (collectively, the “Transaction Parties”) is acting, or will act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612
653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,107,CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS,107.2,Prohibited Transaction Issues,107.2.1,,"Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit ERISA Plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are “parties in interest,” within the meaning of ERISA, or “disqualified persons,” within the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code, unless an exemption is available. Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of a Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any Notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the Notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an initial purchaser or a Guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. 346 ----- In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (“PTCEs”) that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or holding of the Notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers, although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code exempt certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the Notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemptions should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the Notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the Notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing Notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the Notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the Notes (and holding the Notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the Notes. Purchasers of the Notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the Notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws.

The Issuer does not intend to list the Dollar Notes on any securities exchange or automated quotation system. The Issuer intends to apply to list the Euro Notes on the Exchange following the consummation of this offering. There is no assurance that the Euro Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Exchange, and if listed and admitted to trading, there is no assurance that the listing of the Euro Notes will be maintained. Consummation of the offering of the Euro Notes is not contingent on the Issuer making an application or obtaining such listing or admission to trading. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that following the completion of this offering, they presently intend to make a market in the Notes after the completion of the offering. They are not obligated to do so, however, and the ability of the initial purchasers to make a market in the Notes may be impacted by changes in any regulatory requirements applicable to the marketing, holding and trading of, and issuing quotations with respect to, the Notes (including as a result of regulatory developments such as the SEC’s interpretation of Rule 15c2-11 under the Exchange Act and its application to debt securities). Any market-making activities with respect to the Notes may be discontinued at any time without any notice. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance as to the development of any market or the liquidity of any market for the Notes. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop, the market price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, or our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. Also, the offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Notes will trade separately from the Existing Notes, will have a different ISIN and CUSIP than the Existing Notes and will not be fungible with the Existing Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Certain of the relationships involve transactions that are material to us or our affiliates and for which the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have received significant fees. An affiliate of BofA Securities, Inc. acts as administrative agent under the ABL Credit Agreement, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co.

In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be lenders under the Existing Diversey Credit Agreement and will be entitled to receive customary fees in connection therewith and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to repay such indebtedness. In addition, certain of the initial purchasers and/or their affiliates may be holders of the Existing Diversey Notes and may receive a portion of the proceeds of the offering of the Notes used to redeem such indebtedness. In addition, the initial purchasers or their affiliates have made commitments to us with respect to a senior secured bridge facility to finance a portion of the Acquisition. These commitments under such bridge facility will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross cash proceeds of this offering. Affiliates of certain initial purchasers may also participate in the offering of the Notes.

Typically, these initial purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby.

In consideration of the Contribution, Fund IV obtained a minority equity position in the combined business controlled by Fund V (which controls Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.). The Acquisition and Contribution were both separately determined to represent an accounting change of control and are accounted for as business combinations under ASC 805 using the acquisition method of accounting.

Nature of Operations Solenis is a leading supplier of specialty chemicals and services to the pulp and paper, mining, food and beverage, power generation, refining, chemical processing, general manufacturing, municipal and pools markets. It offers chemical and equipment technologies and services designed to help customers improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect plant assets and minimize environmental impact. Solenis has 49 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries. The Company markets and distributes its products and services directly and through third-party distributors in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Solenis’ business principally consists of three operating segments: (1) Consumer, (2) Industrial (which integrates Solenis's prior Industrial Water business and the operating results of its Reverse Supply Agreements with BASF as well as Sigura's Industrial business) and (3) Pools. A brief description for each of these operating segments is as follows: Consumer Solutions – The Consumer (""CS"") business manufactures and sells a broad array of process chemistry for the pulp and paper industry. These products are designed to deliver benefits such as enhanced operational efficiencies, system cleanliness and superior performance in a wide variety of manufacturing operations globally. Industrial Solutions – The Industrial Water (""IS"") business offers specialized chemicals for the utility water treatment market including influent water, boiler water, cooling water and effluent water treatments and process additives. Pools - The Pools Solutions (""PS"") business offers water care products and value-added services offered for residential and commercial pools and spas in consumer channels such as Mass Retail, Professional Dealer and Commercial and services top consumer brands in pool care markets. Solenis’ results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, can have a significant effect on operations. While Solenis maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Solenis could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to environmental remediation or other matters. ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited] ###### Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies ##### Our significant accounting policies are those that we believe are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, as well as those that involve significant judgments or estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. ###### Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents represent cash deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash which has a legal restriction regarding its use or withdrawal is classified as Restricted cash and is classified as Other assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The below table reconciles Cash and cash equivalents to Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 (amounts in thousands): Cash $ 192,418 Current assets 1,202,340 Property, plant & equipment 1,052,676 Intangible assets 2,690,880 Deferred tax assets 119,193 Goodwill 2,114,441 Restricted cash 1,791 Other assets 133,646 Total assets 7,507,385 Current liabilities 719,129 Deferred taxes 411,381 Employee benefit liabilities 100,575 Short term and long-term debt assumed 483,715 Other liabilities 226,937 Total liabilities 1,941,737 Net assets acquired 5,565,648 Less: cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash acquired via the acquisition and contribution 194,209 Less: Non-cash consideration via contribution 500,000 Total net cash conveyed at closing $ 4,871,439 ###### The determination of Goodwill was recognized for the Acquisition and Contribution as the excess of the purchase price over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired for purposes of creating a standalone entity, which cannot be individually identified and separately recognized. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### The fair values of intangible assets were estimated using an income approach, either the excess earnings method (customer relationships) or the relief from royalty method (technology, trademark and trade name, and process know how), multi-period excess earnings method (in process research and development), and with and without method (supply agreements). Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate. Under the multi- period excess earnings method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its projected useful life. Under the with and without method, fair value is measured by estimating future earnings associated with the supply agreement over its projected useful life and comparing that value to an estimate of future earnings without the supply agreement. These intangible assets collectively enable us to manufacture and develop new products to meet the evolving business needs as well as competitively produce our existing products. The fair value of real properties acquired was based on the consideration of their highest and best use in the market. The fair values of property, plant, and equipment, other than real properties, were based on the consideration that unless otherwise identified, they will continue to be used “as is” and as part of the ongoing business. In contemplation of the in-use premise and the nature of the assets, the fair value was developed primarily using a cost approach. The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessing factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition. In connection with the Acquisition, the Company incurred expenses of $47.9 million during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. These expenses are reflected in Acquisition and transaction related expenses within Operating expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Additionally, the Olympus entities incurred $75.0 million of pre-deal transaction expenses prior to September 30, 2021 which are reflected within beginning accumulated deficit. In addition to deal-related transaction costs which were expensed as incurred, the Company also incurred debt financing costs of $165.6 million and $4.2 million of original issue discount which were capitalized at closing and will be amortized on an effective interest method basis over the term of the related debt instruments. In anticipation of the closing of the Acquisition, the Solenis business extinguished obligations of $65.6 million as part of its pre-closing settlements which included $46.7 million to settle remaining balances due under the MUFG Accounts Receivable Financing Facility, $13.7 million related to interest-rate swaps, and $5.2 million related to foreign exchange derivatives. Additionally, Solenis incurred Acquisition related expenses of $57.7 million and time and performance related share-based incentive compensation of $17.8 million which is inclusive of employer related taxes. These costs are reflected in the Predecessor period within Total operating expenses and Non operating income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. As of September 30, 2022, the measurement period with respect to the Acquisition and Contribution has been closed.

A brief description for each of these operating segments is as follows: Consumer Solutions – The Consumer (""CS"") business manufactures and sells a broad array of process chemistry for the pulp and paper industry including deposit and scale control agents, defoamers, biocides, retention aids and crepe and release additives. These products are designed to deliver benefits such as enhanced operational efficiencies, system cleanliness and superior performance in a wide variety of manufacturing operations globally.

In addition, the Industrial Water business offers process additives such as frothers and collection aids, dust control additives, sterilization treatments, corn oil extraction and scale and corrosion inhibitors for mining and mineral processing, food processing, oil refining, chemicals processing and general manufacturing markets. The IS business includes the operating results of Solenis' Reverse Supply Agreements through which Solenis agreed via the JVFA to provide certain finished goods to BASF at below-market prices, consistent with BASF's historical cost and pricing structure. Such agreements are intended to allow BASF to uninterruptedly sustain the businesses that they've retained after the JV which were previously serviced by BASF Paper & Water. Pools - The Pools Solutions (""PS"") business offers water care products and value-added services offered for residential and commercial pools and spas in consumer channels such as Mass Retail, Professional Dealer and Commercial and services top consumer brands in pool care markets. Key brands include, but are not limited to HTH®, Poolife®, GLB®, Leisure Time®, Sirona Spa Care®, and HTH Spa®. The Company also manufactures and supplies automated equipment, including performance-based feed and control systems, proprietary monitoring devices and remote system surveillance. The utility products, services and equipment offerings are designed to protect plant assets and optimize energy, water and operational costs at customers’ facilities. Solenis’ results are affected by domestic and international economic, political, legislative, regulatory and legal actions. Economic conditions, such as recessionary trends, inflation, foreign exchange rates, and interest rates, can have a significant effect on operations. While Solenis maintains reserves for anticipated liabilities and carries various levels of insurance, Solenis could be affected by civil, criminal, regulatory or administrative actions, claims or proceedings relating to environmental remediation or other matters. Note 2  Significant Accounting Policies Use of Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include impairment of long- lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, computation of income tax provision, and calculation of reserves, including those for environmental remediation. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Russia and Ukraine Conflict Geopolitical events such as the recent conflict between Russia, Ukraine and members of the ""North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or ""NATO"" could have significant effects on the business which include restrictions on sales and distribution activities, supply chain disruptions, and limitation on the Company's ability to repatriate funds. Solenis conducts operations in jurisdictions that may be subject to trade or economic sanction regimes and such sanctions could be expanded. Should the Company fail to comply knowingly or unknowingly with sanction regimes or other similar laws or regulations, Solenis could be subject to fines and penalties, suspension of licenses, or a cessation of operations, as well as damage to the Company's image and reputation. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to quickly and completely adapt it's business model to changes that could result from these recent events, and any such changes may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### As of September 30, 2022 and through the date these financial statements were available to be issued, the conflict has not materially impacted the Company's consolidated operations. Total Net sales of the Company's entities in Russia represent 2.6%, 2.0%, 2.4%, and 2.2%, of the Company's consolidated Net sales during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, and the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, September 30, 2021, and September 30, 2020, respectively. Total assets and Cash and cash equivalents held by the Company's entities in Russia represented 3.0% and 11.9%, and 2.0% and 5.0% of the Company's consolidated total assets and Cash and cash equivalents as of the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, and as of the Predecessor period ended September 30, 2021, respectively. Principles of Consolidation and Combination Solenis' Consolidated Financial Statements include all wholly owned subsidiaries of Solenis, including all Holding Companies for both the Predecessor and Successor periods as defined. Investments in companies in which Solenis, directly or indirectly, owns up to 50% of the voting stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. As a result, Solenis’ share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and Solenis' share of these companies’ shareholders’ equity is included in Investments in equity affiliates in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Successor The Company was formed on June 29, 2021. The results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the period from June 29, 2021 until November 8, 2021 (period prior to the Acquisition date) consists of acquisition and start-up costs related to the Acquisition and Contribution. On November 9, 2021, the Company consummated the acquisition of the historical Solenis UK International Limited business and received the contributed legacy Sigura business from other Platinum affiliates. The accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Solenis as of September 30, 2022 and related consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the period through September 30, 2022 and consolidated statements of cash flows and of changes in partners’ equity for the period through September 30, 2022 are labeled as “Successor.” The Successor financial statements as of September 30, 2022 and for the period through September 30, 2022 reflect acquisition accounting and other transaction related adjustments resulting from the Acquisition and Contribution, as well as results of the consolidated legacy Solenis and legacy Sigura operations effective as of November 9, 2021. Predecessor The accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Solenis UK International Limited as of September 30, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income and cash flows for the period from October, 1, 2021 through November 8, 2021 and the years ended September 30, 2021, September 30, 2020, include transactions directly attributable to the closing of the Acquisition and the repayment of certain financial obligations extinguished prior to closing and are labeled as “Predecessor”. As a result of the application of acquisition accounting as of the closing date of the Acquisition, the financial statements for the Successor period and the Predecessor periods are presented on a different basis, and are therefore not comparable. The visible ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### ""black-line"" within these face financial statements and accompanying footnotes presents the demarcation of these different bases of presentation. During the Predecessor periods, standalone financial statements were historically prepared for Solenis UK International Limited. The Predecessor financial statements include the historical operations, assets and liabilities of the legal entities that are considered to comprise the Solenis UK International business. Foreign Currency Translation For both the Predecessor and Successor periods, the reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Operations outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated deficit in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. In circumstances where the economy in which one of the Company's subsidiaries operates is determined to be highly inflationary, the functional currency for the entity is changed to the U.S. dollar on a prospective basis. Refer to Note 23 for discussion surrounding the Company's operations in economies which have been determined to be highly inflationary. Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash Cash and cash equivalents represent cash deposits with financial institutions and highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less. Cash which has a legal restriction regarding its use or withdrawal is classified as Restricted cash and is classified as Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited] ###### In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-09, ""Discount Rate for Lessees That Are Not Public Business Entities"". Topic 842 currently provides lessees that are not public business entities with a practical expedient that allows them to elect, as an accounting policy, to use a risk free rate as the discount rate for all leases. The amendments in this Update allow those lessees to make the risk-free rate election by class of underlying asset, rather than at the entity-wide level. An entity that makes the risk-free rate election is required to disclose which asset classes it has elected to apply a risk-free rate. The amendments require that when the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable for any individual lease, the lessee use that rate (rather than a risk free rate or an incremental borrowing rate), regardless of whether it has made the risk-free rate election. For entities that have adopted Topic 842 as of November 11, 2021, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, ""Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"". The purpose of this ASU is to provide transparency around supplier related financing given the lack of current explicit disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard. Note 3  Revenue Recognition Solenis provides specialty chemical solutions designed to help improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect existing assets, and mitigate environmental impact. The Company has a broad product portfolio across its three segments with a large customer and end-market footprint. In addition to its product portfolio, Solenis also provides support services via its service engineers and application experts and provides access to chemical feed equipment as needed. The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are fulfilled which is when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Solenis allocates the overall contractual consideration to each performance obligation using stand-alone selling prices when available, or will allocate consideration in the absence of stand-alone selling prices by estimating the cost of fulfilling a performance obligation and applying a markup based upon market-participant expectations. Based on the nature of the Company's operations and the structure of its customer contracts, performance obligations are typically fulfilled commensurate with the delivery of product. Solenis' limited number of existing long-term contracts, reliance on accepted purchase orders to determine transaction price, and terms and conditions which require payment upon the fulfillment of product specific performance obligations, limits the potential for material contract assets and liabilities. As of March 31, 2023 and September 30, 2022 the Company has recorded contract assets and liabilities of $0. ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited] ###### below, Solenis entered into a long-term supply agreement with Kolb to ensure continuity of supply as the manufacturing facilities supplying finished goods to the acquired customers were retained by Kolb. The company has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and has preliminarily allocated the fair value of the consideration transferred (cash of $20.0 million; no other consideration transferred) based on management's estimates of fair value. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, $0 of which is deductible for tax purposes. Residual goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired, which cannot be individually identified and separately recognized. The fair values of intangible assets were estimated using an income approach, with the excess earnings method used for customer relationships and the relief from royalty method used for trademarks and tradenames.  Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Under the relief from royalty method, fair value is measured by estimating future revenue associated with the intangible asset over its useful life and applying a royalty rate to the revenue estimate.

This acquisition provides opportunity for Solenis to expand further into the Peruvian market where it currently has a limited presence. Total consideration transferred at closing was $24.0 million, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. In addition to the consideration transferred at closing, the former owners are entitled to incremental compensation based on post- closing financial performance of Grand Invest during a two-year earnout period commencing on February 6, 2023, with an estimated range between $0 and and $12.4 million. As the sellers are required to remain employees of the Company and are required to render service to Solenis during the earnout period, any incremental consideration due to the former employee-owners will be accounted for when incurred as compensation costs. ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited] ###### The company has accounted for the acquisition as a business combination and has preliminarily allocated the purchase considerations based on management's estimates of fair value. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, $0 of which is deductible for tax purposes. Residual goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired for purposes of creating a standalone entity, which cannot be individually identified and separately recognized. The fair values of the intangible assets were estimated using an income approach, utilizing the excess earnings method for customer relationships. Under the excess earnings method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. Adjustments to these measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as new information related to facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date may be identified.

Subsequent to the issuance of the September 30, 2022 financial statements but within the measurement period, Solenis determined that certain customer relationships projected to deliver current period cash flows were lost in the transition from seller to buyer which should have been known and reflected in the opening balance sheet. This unexpected customer attrition resulted in lower sales demand which has reduced Solenis' need for incremental production volumes which are otherwise required to achieve the $50 million earnout paid into escrow at closing. In addition, incremental quantitative and qualitative data points provided by employees of the acquired production facility during the measurement period resulted in a revised fair value determination of the fixed assets recorded to the opening balance sheet. In totality, these data points resulted in reductions to acquired Customer relationship intangibles, reductions to the purchase price via increases in the Contingent consideration receivable, and increases in the value of personal property at the acquired production facility.

Note 6  Sale of Trade Receivables On March 21, 2022, the Company executed an extension of the existing RPA with ING Luxembourg (""ING""), which was originally executed on March 26, 2018 and amended on March 20, 2020. While no other material terms have been revised, the expiration of the RPA was amended to January 31, 2024. Additionally, on March 22, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the RPA to include Solenis Polska Sp. z.o.o. (a Polish subsidiary of the Company; ""Solenis Poland"") as an originator and servicer such that trade receivables generated within Poland can be included within the scope of the facility. Through the Accounts Receivable Financing facilities, the Company sells eligible short-term trade receivables on the initial transfer date in exchange for consideration inclusive of cash conveyed to Solenis (referred to as the Initial Purchase Price, or ""IPP"") and a beneficial interest in the receivables collected by ING (referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price, or ""DPP""). The Company continues to service the receivables sold in connection with the arrangement. The RPA requires Solenis to pledge its cash collection accounts for the underlying receivables to ING whereby neither the receivables sold to ING nor the future cash collections on the sold receivables are assets of Solenis post-transfer. Through maturity, ING purchases new receivables from Solenis on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the jurisdiction, in exchange for incremental DPP. These amounts are settled monthly against sold receivables which were previously collected. The DPP is carried at fair value, which is remeasured weekly to take into account activity during the period (the Company's interest in the newly-transferred receivables and collections on previously transferred receivables attributable to the DPP), as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. Refer to Note 13 for additional discussion surrounding the fair value of the DPP. Receivables are sold to ING with the condition that Solenis indemnify ING in the event of non-collection. Consequently, non-collections on sold receivables could expose the Company to losses. The maximum potential loss surrounding this transaction is equal to the face amount of receivables sold. The Company has evaluated the probability of loss, concluding the risk of material losses associated with this sale is remote. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold during the Successor three months ended March 31, 2023 and three months ended March 31, 2022 were less than $0.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold during the Successor six months ended March 31, 2023, Successor period from November 9, 2021 to March 31, 2022 and Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 were less than $0.1 million, $0.7 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.

These contracts commence in June 2023 and have been designated as and qualify as cash flow hedges. The Company maintains a variety of long-term supply agreements with BASF, it's legacy JV partner during the Predecessor period. Certain of these supply agreements were extended at or around the closing of the the Acquisition and Contribution, and are accounted for as embedded finance leases as of, and during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. Refer to Notes 11 and 14 for further discussion. Predecessor During the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million. As a result of these arrangements, the Company collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.26%, 3.12%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36-month period from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022. For the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021 Solenis reclassified expense of $9.2 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Non operating (income) expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. While Solenis partially mitigated the market driven interest rate risk on its term debt through the use of interest rate swaps, the Company has historically experienced significant foreign exchange risk on its First Lien Euro Loans. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had First Lien Euro Loans of $899.8 million (EUR 777.2 million). To mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with these loans on a go-forward basis, management determined to pursue solutions without incurring the cost or underlying risks associated with derivative financial instruments. Effective April 1, 2021, the Company determined to utilize an intercompany Euro denominated note between two downstream consolidated subsidiaries to act as a hedging instrument in response to the foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's consolidated EUR net asset exposure (i.e. the ""hedged item""). The intercompany note will act as a ""net investment hedge"" through which changes in the USD equivalent of the intercompany note will be recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) rather than through the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as is common for foreign currency denominated monetary instruments. The use of an intercompany note is permissible under ASC 815-20, Derivatives, only to the extent that the intercompany note reflects the consolidated foreign exchange risk of the consolidated company, and the entity party to the third-party debt instrument is the counterparty to the intercompany note designated as a hedging instrument. As of April 1, 2021 and through November 8, 2021, Solenis meets both of these criteria required to assume a net investment hedge. Each month, Solenis redesignates a specific amount of Euro denominated intercompany notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro net assets. The Company's designation is limited to the lowest value in the subset of data points among: 1) The total Euro value of the intercompany note outstanding, 2) The total Euro value of Solenis' consolidated First Lien Euro Loans, and 3) The total Euro value of Solenis' net assets in consolidated subsidiaries that utilize a Euro functional currency. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had designated EUR 777.2 million of its intercompany Euro notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited] ###### the foreign currency risk associated with the Company's $816.1 million of consolidated Euro net assets (relative to total First Lien Euro Loans of EUR 777.2 million). No reclassifications of Other comprehensive income (loss) specific to the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the next 12 months. During the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021, the Company deferred incremental unrealized gains on its EUR term loans of $1.1 million to Other Comprehensive Income. In connection with the settlement of its existing debt for the Olympus closing which removes the underlying hedged item critical to ensure the effectiveness of the Net Investment Hedge, the Company reclassified the $10.4 million and $1.1 million of unrealized gains deferred in the collective Predecessor periods (total of $11.5 million) to realized gains within Non operating expense (income), net, on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021.

The maximum RPA capacity carried by MUFG was $75.0 million to serve the US market. The RPA agreement with MUFG was scheduled to expire in March of 2022. In connection with the Acquisition, Solenis fully repaid its outstanding obligations to MUFG of $46.7 million, inclusive of accrued interest through November 8, 2021 of $0.1 million. The reduction of Solenis' principal obligations was recognized as a net increase to Accounts Receivable and Sold Receivables on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of $46.6 million, while the $0.1 million of interest expense was recognized via Interest expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021. As of November 9, 2021, Olympus remains party to the ING RPA and will continue to sell receivables in ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements [Unaudited] ###### certain European markets and Canada. Various amended RPAs with ING have been executed since March 20, 2020, with a current expiration date of January 31, 2024. Refer to Note 6 for additional details. Initial consideration received through the Accounts Receivable Financing included a subordinated interest in transferred receivables collected, referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price. The DPP is carried at fair value and is remeasured weekly to reflect activity during the period (i.e. the Company's interest in subsequently-transferred receivables and collections on receivables previously sold to ING or MUFG) as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. The fair value of the DPP is predicated upon the underlying receivables which have been transferred to ING or MUFG. As the underlying receivables represent the Company's customers with the highest credit quality and are generally collectible within 90 days, the Company expects the fair value of the DPP to be equal to its face value. Receivables under the Accounts Receivable Financing are transferred to ING or MUFG daily, weekly, or monthly in accordance with the prevailing agreement for each jurisdiction. The consideration for the transfer of these receivables is incremental DPP to be settled at each settlement date, as defined in the RPAs. As the receivables transferred to ING and MUFG do not have an active market for equivalent or similar assets, the Company's fair value assessment is predicated upon its own history of collection surrounding the specific customers' receivables which have been transferred. Accordingly, such inputs qualify as Level 3 inputs. Due to the high credit quality and the relatively short-term nature of the underlying receivables, fluctuations in credit quality are expected to have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the DPP. Note 13  Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments In connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture with BASF on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a number of ""take or pay"" contracts (the ""Supply Agreements"") through which BASF will make certain materials required to service acquired BASF legacy customers available to Solenis based upon a combination of legacy BASF volumes for these materials and available manufacturing capacity. The term of these agreements is either three (the ""Medium Term""), or eight years (the ""Long Term""). Upon maturity, each of the Medium Term agreements will automatically extend for 12 months on a revolving basis unless either party provides 24 months notice of their intention to exit the agreement. There is no penalty for either party to exit provided the 24 month notice period is met. Upon maturity, each of the Long Term agreements will expire immediately unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Solenis and BASF. Given the substantial capital and working capital requirements necessary to maintain available capacity and meet Solenis' purchasing requirements, the Company is required to remit minimum monthly payments (the ""Fixed Manufacturing Costs"") designed to cover BASF's plant overhead costs specific to the impacted production lines. The monthly payments are fixed and determinable, based on allocations of BASF's heritage costing structure relative to expected production and volumes and vary only based upon annual changes in inflation rates observable in the public domain. ----- ##### Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.

Equity Incentive Plan (the ""Plan"") pursuant to which the Company's board of directors shall select officers and key employees and directors to participate in the plan and grant stock options and offer opportunities to purchase shares. The plan allows for the issuance of up to 13,229,989 common units under the plan (for all share-based compensation and share purchases). All stock options granted have a term not greater than ten years. Stock options vest and become exercisable, in whole or in part, with vesting conditions set by the Company's Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2022, 1,701,462 options were available for grant. The options are provided in two separate grants which for accounting purposes have one vesting condition. Service Options vest in four equal annual installments, coinciding with the first anniversary date of the grant date and each successive anniversary thereafter. Performance Options vest only upon the occurrence of a Change in Control or Public Offering if after giving effect to such Change in Control or Public Offering the Investors realize a pre-tax, cash-on-cash return equal to a multiple of its invested capital with respect to the Company of at least 2.0x (the “MOIC Hurdle”), subject to the Employee’s continued employment through the date of such Change in Control or Public Offering. The vesting Service and Performance Options are contingent upon continuous employment through the respective measurement dates. Stock Options The Stock incentive plan allows stock option grants for shares at a price based on the most recent valuation of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of the grant and may be subject to anti-dilution. Stock options under the plan aren't exercisable unless a change of control event. Every option equals one share. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Due to the market condition criteria that exists for employees to exercise service and performance based options Share-based compensation expense is not recognized under the Plan until an event occurs that would trigger a Change in Control or Public Offering.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: ###### ● Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. ● Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. ###### ● Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. ###### ● Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. ###### ● Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.

(hereafter ""Olympus"" or ""the Company""), doing business as ""Solenis"" from November 9, 2021, is an exempted limited partnership registered and domiciled under the laws of the Cayman Islands. Olympus and several other holding companies and partnerships were formed by affiliates of Platinum Equity Advisors, LLC (""Platinum""), all of which are organized under Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P, a Cayman exempted limited partnership whose partners are certain investment vehicles advised by Platinum and members of the Solenis management team. The Company was formed on June 29, 2021 and exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of consummating the purchase of the consolidated operations of Solenis UK International Limited (the ""Acquisition"" or the ""Transaction""). The Solenis business was formerly owned by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (""CD&R""), BASF SE, and management. The Company also exists as the Successor entity for the specific purpose of receiving the contribution of Innovative Water Global Corporation (doing business as ""Sigura"", i.e. the ""Contribution""). The Sigura business was formerly 100% owned by affiliates of Platinum and was contributed to Olympus immediately subsequent to the Acquisition on November 9, 2021 and both qualified and were accounted for as Business Combinations under ASC 805. Olympus was formed under a group of holding companies. Olympus Water Holdings I, L.P. holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings II, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership. Olympus Water Holdings II L.P. holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus Water Holdings III, L.P. a Cayman exempted limited partnership. Olympus Water Holdings III holds effectively 100% of the partnership interest in Olympus. These holding companies and partnerships are collectively referred to as the ""Holding Companies"". The Holding Companies have no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents, certain related party loans between and among the Holding Companies and Solenis, and investments in the ownership interests described above. The Company acquired the consolidated operations of Solenis UK International Limited through a series of acquisition steps defined as the ""Alternative Transaction Structure"" (the ""ATS"") in the Securities Purchase Agreement (""SPA"") effective November 9, 2021. The ATS resulted in the following legal ownership structure: Olympus owns 100% of the shares of Olympus Water US Holding Corporation domiciled in the United States of America (the ""US""), and 100% of the shares of Olympus Water UK Holding Limited domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the ""UK""); Olympus Water US Holding Corporation owns 100% of the equity interest of Solenis Holdings LLC domiciled in the US, and all of its wholly-owned direct subsidiaries; Olympus Water UK Holdings Limited owns 100% of the shares (membership interest) of: • Olympus Water Canada Acquisition ULC which was formed for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the equity interest in Solenis Canada ULC; • Olympus Water France Acquisition SaS which was formed for the purpose of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis France; • Olympus Water Germany Acquisition GmbH which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the membership interest of Solenis Germany Administrative GmbH and all of its wholly-owned direct and ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### indirect subsidiaries, as well as, 100% of the Limited Partner interest in Solenis Germany GmbH & Co KG and all of its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries; • Olympus Water Italy Acquisition S.r.l which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis Italia Holdings S.r.l and all of it's wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries; • Olympus Water Sweden Acquisition AB which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis Sweden Holdings AB and all of it's wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries; • Olympus Water Spain Acquisition S.L. which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the shares of Solenis Hispania S.A. and all of its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries; • Olympus Water Dutch Acquisition B.V. which was formed for the purposes of acquiring 100% of the members interest in Solenis Holdings I Cooperatief U.A. and all its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, as well, as 100% of the member interest of Solenis Holdings II Cooperatief and all of its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries, and; • Solenis UK Industries Limited and all of its wholly-owned direct and indirect subsidiaries Upon the execution of the acquisition steps, Platinum acquired all of the capital stock and equity interests of the entities comprising the legacy Solenis operations from Solenis UK Holdings Limited. Economic control and legal ownership of the Solenis UK Holdings Limited and Solenis UK International Limited legal entities were retained by CD&R and had no business operations or assets other than cash and cash equivalents prior to the Acquisition. Immediately following the Acquisition, the Contribution which included all of Sigura's direct and indirect subsidiaries was contributed to Olympus Water Holdings I, LP, and ultimately to Olympus Water US Holding Corporation by affiliates of Platinum Equity. Accordingly, the conclusion of the Acquisition and Contribution results in the consolidation of the operations of the legacy Solenis and Sigura businesses (under the Solenis umbrella) from November 9, 2021 within these financial statements as presented under the ""Successor"" periods. Prior to the formation of the Company, the business existed under the ""Predecessor"" entity known as Solenis UK International Limited (the ""Legacy Topco"") and was domiciled in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Legacy Topco was formed on August 31, 2018 for the specific purpose of consummating a Joint Venture (the ""Joint Venture"", ""JV"", or ""JVFA"") between BASF SE (""BASF"") a German-based chemical manufacturer and distributor, and the Solenis business, which was 97% owned by CD&R and 3% owned by management immediately prior to the JV. The Predecessor entity has financial statements as of and for periods prior to the Acquisition. The purchase price for the Acquisition was funded by (i) an equity contribution of $1.96 billion into the Holding Companies by entities affiliated with Platinum, (ii) an equity contribution of $24.8 million by certain members of management, (iii) gross proceeds from borrowings under Term Loan facilities of $1.69 billion, and (iv) gross proceeds from borrowings under the secured and unsecured bonds of $2.10 billion. Olympus Water US Holding Corporation is the legal borrower under the Secured and Unsecured Bonds and related Term Loan facilities. The Bonds and Term Loan facilities are fully described in Note 12. Acquisition of Solenis and Contribution of Sigura On November 9, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the Solenis business pursuant to the terms of the SPA, dated July 3, 2021, between CD&R Seahawk Holdings, L.P. BASF Nederland B.V., and Solenis UK International Limited (the “Agreement”). The estimated purchase price was based on an enterprise value of $5.25 billion, less certain adjustments made pursuant to the Agreement, including retained finance leases, pension and other liabilities, tax adjustments and other fees, which includes the repayment of the Solenis Existing Indebtedness (other than the ING Receivables Purchasing agreement, which will remain in place following the consummation of the Acquisition), including any breakage fees associated therewith, at closing which resulted in ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### a net cash purchase price of $5.1 billion exclusive of any cash acquired. The purchase price was subject to post- closing adjustments for (i) differences between estimated and actual Net Working Capital at closing, (ii) differences between estimated and actual Net Indebtedness at closing and (iii) differences between the estimated and actual unfunded pension liabilities for certain pension obligations that the Company assumed. Immediately following the acquisition of Solenis, the Contribution was effectuated for a value of $500.0 million. The contribution was made from Platinum Equity Fund IV (""Fund IV""; which had owned 100% of the Sigura business) to Platinum Equity Fund V (""Fund V""). In consideration of the Contribution, Fund IV obtained a minority equity position in the combined business controlled by Fund V (which controls Olympus Water Holdings IV, L.P.). The Acquisition and Contribution were both separately determined to represent an accounting change of control and are accounted for as business combinations under ASC 805 using the acquisition method of accounting. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was allocated to goodwill, none of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The following table summarizes the fair values of the net assets acquired as of the November 9, 2021 Acquisition and Contribution dates ($ in thousands):",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The carrying value of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangibles, to be held and used is evaluated when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. The fair value methodology used is an estimate of fair market value and is based on prices of similar assets or other valuation methodologies including present value techniques. Commitments, Contingencies and Environmental Costs Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and/or remediation can be reasonably estimated. Accruals for environmental remediation are recognized when it is probable, when a liability has been incurred and the amount of that liability can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities are recorded at estimated present values based on experience, assessments and current technology, without regard to any third-party recoveries (which are recorded as assets) and are regularly adjusted as environmental assessments and remediation efforts advance. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Retirement Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits The Company has certain defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations for current and former employees of non-US subsidiaries. Defined benefit plans specify an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The net obligation in respect of defined benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of the future benefits that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. These benefits are then discounted to determine the present value of the obligations and are then adjusted for the impact of any unamortized prior service costs. The net obligation is then determined with reference to the fair value of the plan assets (if any). The discount rate used to determine the present value of existing obligations is typically the yield on bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have maturity dates approximating the term of the obligations. Share-based Compensation The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense for all options and other arrangements within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 718. Awards are classified as equity if such options are settled in shares and classified as liabilities if they are settled in cash. Share-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized using the ""straight-line attribution method"" over the employee’s requisite service period for service awards and on a tranche-by-tranche basis for awards with performance or market driven vesting conditions. Awards classified as liabilities are measured for fair value at each reporting date on a ""mark to market"" basis, with any changes to fair value recognized currently in earnings based on the extent of the requisite service period elapsed. The fair value of awards classified as liabilities are presented as a component of Accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information on the Company`s share-based compensation arrangements, refer to Note 17. Fair Value Measurements U.S. GAAP defines a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following valuation techniques are used to measure fair value for assets and liabilities: Level 1- Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2- Significant other observable inputs (e.g., quoted prices for similar items in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar items in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as interest rate and yield curves, and market-corroborated inputs); Level 3- Unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities which are valued based on management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability; and ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Net Asset Value (""NAV"")- The Company invests in funds which are not quoted on an active market. These funds are valued based on the underlying fair value of the funds investments less the funds liabilities or net asset value. Derivatives The Company is exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates, foreign currency rates, changes in commodity prices and credit risk. In the Predecessor periods, the Company utilized interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuating interest rates on its long term debt and net investment hedging to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro denominated net assets and third-party debt. Refer to specific discussion of these arrangements within Note 14. Cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as part of Cash Flows from Operations in the Predecessor period only. Sale of Accounts Receivable The Company accounts for sales of trade receivables when control is relinquished. Whether control has been relinquished requires among other considerations, an evaluation of the relevant legal constructs and an assessment of the nature and extent of the Company's continuing involvement with the receivables transferred. Assets obtained and liabilities incurred in connection with the transfers reported as sales are initially recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Accounts receivable sold are deemed transferred to a counterparty in accordance with the prevailing purchase agreement applicable to the relevant jurisdiction. In situations where cash is immediately received from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, such cash is classified as cash received from operating activities. In situations where cash is not received immediately from the counterparty upon sale of the receivable, the transfer is deemed to represent a non-cash investing activity whereby the receivable is sold for a subordinated interest in future cash collections. Ultimate collections of cash on the subordinated interest in future cash collections are treated as cash flows from investing activities. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB announced new lease accounting guidance in ASU 2016-02, ""Leases"" (""ASC 842""). Under the new guidance, lessees are required to measure and capitalize future payment obligations greater than one year as a lease liability, while recognizing the offsetting ability to use, or control a specified leased asset during the lease term as a right-of-use (""ROU"") asset. The adoption timeline of the new standard has been amended and deferred though the current required adoption date for private issuers is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Given the significant investment in new controls, procedures and documentation requirements, the Company had previously planned to meet an earlier adoption timeline prior to the one-year deferral noted in ASU 2020-05 and as such, adopted ASC 842 on October 1, 2020 utilizing a modified retrospective approach and elected the package of practical expedients at the transition date. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in a material change to the Consolidated Balance Sheets to reflect the gross-up of operating lease liabilities and the related ROU assets, though the other related face statements are not significantly impacted. The adoption of ASC 842 required adjustments to record the initial lease liabilities and ROU assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Despite the use of the modified retrospective approach, the impact of adoption on the Consolidated Statements of Operations was deemed to be immaterial especially as leases previously recognized as capital leases under ASC 840 are recognized as finance leases in transition and as such, no changes were recorded to the Company's Accumulated deficit as of October 1, 2020. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### On October 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)"", using the modified retrospective adoption method. This standard attempts to align the revenue recognition frameworks put forth by the FASB and IASB and eliminate some of the industry specific guidance that has led to revenue recognition discrepancies in practice for economically similar transactions. In substance, the standard speaks to a principles driven approach through which an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASC 606 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance previously codified under ASC 605, though the principles described within ASC 605 remain largely unchanged in the revised standard. The adoption of the standard results in incremental disclosure requirements regarding the disaggregation of revenue, discussion of the allocation of consideration to the Company's performance obligations and the pattern of recognition associated with those obligations. Despite the transition, no adjustments to retained earnings on a cumulative basis or other adjustments to the Consolidated Balance Sheets were deemed necessary. In general, there is no quantitative impact associated with the Company's adoption of the standard given the limited complexity of the Company's business model. Using the practical expedients provided for under the modified retrospective adoption method, ASC 606 was applied through the specific lens of the Company's existing contracts as of October 1, 2020, and those which were entered into subsequent to the adoption date. Comparative financial information has not been evaluated and continues to be presented under ASC 605. Refer to Note 3 for discussion. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, ""Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement"". The update removed the disclosure requirements from Topic 820 for the valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements. Adoption of this standard is required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted upon issuance of the update. Retrospective application is required upon adoption. Solenis adopted the standard during the year ended September 30, 2021. Announced Accounting Standards In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, ""Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."" The guidance requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of many financial assets. This new guidance is effective for private companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, but early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating the impact this standard would have on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; the most notable impact of this ASU will relate to the Company's processes around the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on trade receivables. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-07, ""Compensation - Stock Compensation - Determining the Current Price of an Underlying Share"". The guidance allows a nonpublic entity to determine the current price input of equity-classified share-based awards issued to both employees and non-employees using the reasonable application of a reasonable valuation method. The guidance is effective prospectively for all qualifying awards granted or modified during fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-09, ""Discount Rate for Lessees That Are Not Public Business Entities"". Topic 842 currently provides lessees that are not public business entities with a practical expedient that allows them to elect, as an accounting policy, to use a risk free rate as the discount rate for all leases. The amendments in this Update allow those lessees to make the risk-free rate election by class of underlying asset, rather than at the entity-wide level. An entity that makes the risk-free rate election is required to disclose which ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### asset classes it has elected to apply a risk-free rate. The amendments require that when the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable for any individual lease, the lessee use that rate (rather than a risk free rate or an incremental borrowing rate), regardless of whether it has made the risk-free rate election. For entities that have adopted Topic 842 as of November 11, 2021, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Earlier application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, ""Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"". The purpose of this ASU is to provide transparency around supplier related financing given the lack of current explicit disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Management is currently evaluating impact of adopting this standard. Note 3  Revenue Recognition Solenis provides specialty chemical solutions designed to help improve operational efficiencies, enhance product quality, protect existing assets, and mitigate environmental impact. The Company has a broad product portfolio across its three segments with a large customer and end-market footprint. In addition to its product portfolio, Solenis also provides support services via its service engineers and application experts and provides access to chemical feed equipment as needed. The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations are fulfilled which is when control of the product or service is transferred to the customer. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Solenis allocates the overall contractual consideration to each performance obligation using stand-alone selling prices when available, or will allocate consideration in the absence of stand-alone selling prices by estimating the cost of fulfilling a performance obligation and applying a markup based upon market-participant expectations. Based on the nature of the Company's operations and the structure of its customer contracts, performance obligations are typically fulfilled commensurate with the delivery of product. Arrangements with customers vary based upon customer needs and requirements and as such, long-term written contracts that provide for a measurable transaction price at commencement are an exception. In certain instances, terms and conditions between the Company and its customers are reflected in master service agreements (""MSAs""). When relevant, Solenis considers MSAs to provide customers with options to purchase goods and services through which no material rights are conveyed. Accordingly, the Company typically considers accepted purchase orders to represent customer contracts through which legal rights and obligations are formalized and a transaction price becomes measurable. In normal course, Solenis invoices the customer when title to and risk of loss of the product have been transferred. Payment terms vary by geography but are typically between 30 and 90 days subsequent to the fulfillment of a product specific performance obligation. Given the limited duration of payment terms, the Company does not have significant financing components. Solenis' limited number of existing long-term contracts, reliance on accepted purchase orders to determine transaction price, and terms and conditions which require payment upon the fulfillment of product specific performance obligations, limits the potential for material contract assets and liabilities. As of the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and the Predecessor period ended September 30, 2021 the Company has recorded contract assets and liabilities of $0. Solenis elected the practical expedient to treat shipping and handling activities as fulfillment activities, as such amounts billed for shipping and handling fees are recognized within Net sales, and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as Cost of sales. Amount billed for sales and use taxes, value added taxes and other ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### transactions taxes are presented on a net basis and excluded from the presentation of Net sales on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The nature of the Company’s business gives rise to variable consideration, including discounts, customer rebates and rights of return on product sales that decrease the transaction price and reduces revenue. These amounts are estimated based upon the most likely amount of consideration to which the customer will be entitled. All estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and the Company’s best judgment at the time to the extent it is probable, that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. All estimates for variable consideration are reassessed periodically. Based on the structure of compensation arrangements with sales employees and the period of performance for contracts being less than one year, costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers are expensed as incurred. For the Successor period and Predecessor periods, Net sales disaggregated by region are presented below (in thousands):",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the Company's best estimate of losses inherent in the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. Accounts receivable are written down or off when a portion or all of such account receivable is determined to be uncollectible. Bad debt expense is recorded as a component of Selling, general and administration expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, Solenis maintains various global credit insurance policies which serve to partially indemnify the Company from the risk of loss related to uncollectible trade receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on a gross basis, independent of any considerations regarding potential indemnification assets resulting from successfully submitted claims under the Company's credit insurance policies. This indemnification asset is recorded as a component of Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The related benefit available to the Company for successfully submitted claims is recorded as a contra-expense as a component of Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Inventories, net Inventory of the Successor acquired in the Acquisition and Contribution was recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Inventories on hand purchased subsequent to the Acquisition are valued the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on the weighted average cost method. Inventories deemed to have costs greater than their respective market values are reduced to net realizable value as a loss in the period recognized. Inventories on hand are continually assessed to identify excess or obsolete inventory based on anticipated demand and a provision is recorded for any estimated loss. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment of the Successor acquired via the Acquisition and Contribution was recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent additions to property, plant & equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Estimated useful lives by asset class are summarized below for both the Successor and Predecessor period: Buildings and building improvements 5 to 30 years Machinery and equipment 2 to 15 years Software 2 to 5 years ###### The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present. Such indicators include, among other factors, operating losses, unused capacity, market value declines, and technological obsolescence. Recorded values of property, plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value, which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows (assets held for use) or net realizable value (assets held for sale). There were no impairment charges for property, plant & equipment during the Successor period or either of the Predecessor periods. Depreciation expense is presented as a component of Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, depending upon the use of the underlying asset. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Revenue Recognition For the Successor period ending September 30, 2022, the Predecessor period from October 1, 2021 through November 8, 2021 and the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2021, revenues are recognized in accordance with ASC 606. For the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2020, revenues were recognized in accordance with ASC 605. As the Company did not record an adjustment through retained earnings in transition, there are no quantifiable variances in revenue recognition between standards or periods. Refer to Note 3 for a detailed discussion of the Company's contracts, performance obligations, and revenue recognition patterns. Expense Recognition Cost of sales includes material and production costs, as well as the costs of inbound and outbound freight, purchasing and receiving, inspection, warehousing, internal transfers, and all other distribution network costs. Selling, general and administrative expense includes sales and marketing costs, advertising, customer support, environmental remediation and administrative costs. The Company does not sell products with warranties. Accordingly, there are no liabilities for product warranties. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are reported as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses. Advertising expenses were $17.3 million for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, $0.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.7 million for the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Research and Development Research and development costs incurred during the normal course of business are expensed as incurred. In- process research development projects acquired in a business combination are recorded as intangible assets at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequent costs related to acquire in-process research and development assets are expensed as incurred. Litigation The Company accrues for liabilities related to litigation matters when available information indicates that the liability is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs such as outside counsel fees and expenses are charged to expense in the period incurred. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applicable in the years in which they are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Where the Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company provides for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes, where applicable, on undistributed earnings. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### The Company recognizes the benefit of an income tax position only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. Additionally, the Company accrues for estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of provision for income taxes. The current portion of unrecognized tax benefits is included within Trade and other payables and the long-term portion is included within Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Value Added Taxes (""VAT"") Solenis is subject to VAT in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company’s collective global VAT positions do not have a right of offset and are netted by jurisdiction for financial statement presentation purposes. The Company provides for gross asset, and gross liability positions within Prepaid expenses and other assets, and within Accrued expenses, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company presents the net change in its global VAT positions within Other assets and liabilities. Accounting for Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date fair values. As applicable, any excess purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets is recorded as Goodwill. The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, involves an assessment of the factors including, but not limited to the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and an appropriate discount rate at the closing date of an acquisition. For non-observable market values, the Company determines fair value using acceptable valuation principles. Goodwill and Intangible Assets In accordance with ASC 350, impairment tests are performed for goodwill and in-process research and development assets annually as of July 1 and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company assigns goodwill to individual reporting units at the date of acquisition based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination. This assessment is based solely on the pre-acquisition expectation of revenue and free cash flow by reporting unit. When conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. If, after assessing the totality of events and circumstances, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit (or asset, specific to any in-process research and development assets) is less than its carrying amount, then performing the quantitative impairment test is unnecessary. When determined necessary under the qualitative assessment, Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The latter is determined using a combination of discounted cash flow models and valuations based on earnings multiples. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies for goodwill are employed and include, but are not limited to, projected business results and future industry direction, long-term growth factors and the weighted-average cost of capital for a market participant. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### The Successor holds certain intangible in process research and development assets classified as indefinite until the abandonment or completion of the associated research and development efforts. If abandoned, these assets will be impaired. If the activities are completed, the useful life of the assets will be determined and amortized prospectively. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Estimated useful lives and asset classes are as follows for the Successor Period and Predecessor Period, respectively:",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Prior to the transaction, SCL sold DMA3 (a raw material critical to polyacrylamide production) to a limited number of customers which included Solenis. In addition to retaining other third party customer relationships, Solenis plans to utilize the additional DMA3 production capacity as an insourcing synergy to further expand into the polyacrylamide market.

Historically, MFG has acted as a toller of certain chemistries for the Company and its competitors. The total purchase price is $31.3 million subject to finalized working capital considerations and other contingencies.

The LTSA will provide Solenis Shanghai with an uninterrupted, eight year supply of finished goods required to serve former BASF customers acquired via Solenis' acquisition of the BASF Paper and Water business in January 2019. The $59.9 million deposit was originally conveyed via Solenis Holdings Top I B.V. (a consolidated Dutch subsidiary of Solenis) to BASF Nederland B.V. (""BASF NL"") in January 2019, representing the estimated residual fair value of BASF Nanjing's manufacturing facility in Nanjing, China. The deposit was conveyed with the intention between the parties of transferring asset titles and operating permits from BASF to Solenis on, or prior to, January 31, 2022, upon which the existing three-year supply agreement between BASF Nanjing and Solenis Shanghai is scheduled to expire. The deposit was originally conveyed while the parties sought to perfect their intentions of transferring legal ownership on the basis that three years would be sufficient to achieve their original intentions. Despite the intent of both parties, the possibility of permit transfer appears to be remote and as such, the parties agreed to utilize the option consideration to create a new eight year supply agreement that will supersede the existing three year agreement. In consideration of the new LTSA, BASF NL returned the $59.9 million deposit to Solenis Holding Top I B.V. who in-turn provided funds to Solenis Shanghai such that funds could be conveyed locally to BASF Nanjing in China. In addition to $59.9 million of the initial deposit, Solenis Shanghai conveyed an incremental $5.0 million of cash representing embedded realized foreign exchange losses from the initial transaction and local transfer taxes. As of October 1, 2021 and in consideration of the cash paid by Solenis Shanghai, the LTSA is effective and a corresponding reclassification from Acquisition-related deposits to an embedded lease right-of-use asset, and an intangible asset (amortizable over the term of the eight-year agreement) was recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Note 5  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are carried at amounts that approximate fair value.

As such and on a recurring basis, Solenis performs an analysis of its bad debt positions to determine potential indemnification under these policies. For the Successor period as of September 30, 2022 and Predecessor Period as of September 30, 2021, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $1.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively, reflected within Prepaid expenses and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, Solenis recorded benefits of $0.9 million, less than $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.7 million respectively, as a reduction to Selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Note 6  Sale of Trade Receivables On March 26, 2018, the Company sold certain accounts receivable under the terms of a Receivables Purchase Agreement (""RPA"" or ""Accounts Receivable Financing"") with ING Luxembourg (""ING""). The RPA carried a maximum capacity of $120.0 million and was scheduled to expire on September 30, 2020. On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING will continue to service non-US markets with a maximum funding capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum funding capacity carried by MUFG to serve the US market is $75 million. |Successor|Predecessor| |---|---| |For the period from November 9, 2021 to September 30,|For the period For the year For the year ended from October 1 to ended September 30, November 8, September 30,| |2022|2021 2021 2020| |$ 3,752|$ (2) $ 1,245 $ 2,101| ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### In connection with the Acquisition, Solenis fully repaid its outstanding obligations to MUFG of $46.7 million, inclusive of accrued interest through November 8, 2021 of $0.1 million. The reduction of Solenis' principal obligations was recognized as a net increase to Accounts Receivable and Sold Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $46.6 million, while the $0.1 million of interest expense was recognized via Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021. As of November 9, 2021, Olympus remains party to the ING RPA and will continue to sell receivables in certain European markets and Canada. On March 21, 2022, the Company executed an extension of the existing RPA with ING. While no other material terms have been revised, the expiration of the RPA was amended to January 31, 2024. Through the Accounts Receivable Financing facilities, the Company sells eligible short-term trade receivables on the initial transfer date in exchange for consideration inclusive of cash conveyed to Solenis (referred to as the Initial Purchase Price, or ""IPP"") and a beneficial interest in the receivables collected by ING (referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price, or ""DPP""). The Company continues to service the receivables sold in connection with the arrangement. The RPA requires Solenis to pledge its cash collection accounts for the underlying receivables to ING whereby neither the receivables sold to ING nor the future cash collections on the sold receivables are assets of Solenis post-transfer. Through maturity, ING purchases new receivables from Solenis on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, depending on the jurisdiction, in exchange for incremental DPP. These amounts are settled monthly against sold receivables which were previously collected. The DPP is carried at fair value, which is remeasured weekly to take into account activity during the period (the Company's interest in the newly-transferred receivables and collections on previously transferred receivables attributable to the DPP), as well as changes in estimates of future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. Refer to Note 14 for additional discussion surrounding the fair value of the DPP. Receivables are sold to ING with the condition that Solenis indemnify ING in the event of non-collection. Consequently, non-collections on sold receivables could expose the Company to losses. The maximum potential loss surrounding this transaction is equal to the face amount of receivables sold. The Company has evaluated the probability of loss, concluding the risk of material losses associated with this sale is remote. Credit losses and delinquencies with respect to receivables sold during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 were $0.7 million, while losses were less than $0.1 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million during the Predecessor periods ended November 8, 2021, and for the years ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively.

Subsequent to the opening balance sheet date for Olympus, the Company closed three additional acquisitions, two of which were accounted for within the scope of ASC 805, resulting in the recognition of incremental goodwill. These transactions include: On September 9, 2022, the company acquired Clearon Corporation, an American producer and distributor of pool treatment chemicals. Total net consideration transferred was $261.3 million which was ascribed to the net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805. Residual goodwill ascribed to this acquisition was $85.1 million, of which $0 is deductible for tax purposes. Additionally, on May 6, 2022, the Company acquired Neu Kimya, a Turkish producer and distributor of water treatment chemicals primarily serving Oil and Gas customers in Turkey and throughout the Middle East. Total net consideration transferred was $25.6 million which was ascribed to the net assets acquired in accordance with ASC 805. Residual goodwill ascribed to this acquisition was $5.8 million, of which of which $0 is deductible for tax purposes. Predecessor: During the year ended September 30, 2021, Solenis deconsolidated the net assets of Solenis Trinidad and Tobago Limited (""Solenis Trinidad"") resulting from a loss of control in anticipation of a full liquidation of the net assets of the entity. As a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recognized a loss of $18.0 million reflected within Non-operating (income) expense, equal to the difference between the fair value of Solenis' residual non- controlling interest and the previously consolidated net assets of Solenis Trinidad. As a component of the overall loss recorded, Solenis wrote-off $12.8 million of Goodwill.

Pension plan assets are managed by outside investment managers, which are monitored against investment return benchmarks and our established investment strategy. Investment managers are selected based on an analysis of, among other things, their investment process, historical investment results, and frequency of management turnover, cost structure and assets under management. Assets are periodically reallocated between investment managers to maintain an appropriate asset mix and diversification of investments and to optimize returns. Plan assets include both fixed income and traditional equity securities that are allocated across both domestic and international markets. Additionally, certain pension plan assets are dictated by applicable regulations within the respective country. The weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows: ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Cash flows Expected Company contributions to the pension plans over the next twelve months are estimated to be $4.0 million.

On March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amended agreement with ING and a new agreement with MUFG Bank, Ltd (“MUFG”), through which ING agreed to continue serving non-US markets for a maximum capacity of €110 million and further sell its interest in US markets to MUFG. The maximum RPA capacity carried by MUFG is $75 million to serve the US market. The RPA agreement with MUFG was scheduled to expire in March of 2022. In connection with the Acquisition, Solenis fully repaid its outstanding obligations to MUFG of $46.7 million, inclusive of accrued interest through November 8, 2021 of $0.1 million. The reduction of Solenis' principal obligations was recognized as a net increase to Accounts Receivable and Sold Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $46.6 million, while the $0.1 million of interest expense was recognized via Interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021. As of November 9, 2021, Olympus remains party to the ING RPA and will continue to sell receivables in certain European markets and Canada. Various amended RPAs with ING have been executed since March 20, 2020, with a current expiration date of January 31, 2024. Refer to Note 6 for additional details. Initial consideration received through the Accounts Receivable Financing included a subordinated interest in transferred receivables collected, referred to as the Deferred Purchase Price. The DPP is carried at fair value and is remeasured weekly to reflect activity during the period (i.e. the Company's interest in subsequently-transferred receivables and collections on receivables previously sold to ING or MUFG) as well as changes in estimates of ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### future interest rates and anticipated credit losses. The fair value of the DPP is predicated upon the underlying receivables which have been transferred to ING or MUFG. As the underlying receivables represent the Company's customers with the highest credit quality and are generally collectible within 90 days, the Company expects the fair value of the DPP to be equal to its face value. Receivables under the Accounts Receivable Financing are transferred to ING or MUFG daily, weekly, or monthly in accordance with the prevailing agreement for each jurisdiction. The consideration for the transfer of these receivables is incremental DPP to be settled at each settlement date, as defined in the RPAs. As the receivables transferred to ING and MUFG do not have an active market for equivalent or similar assets, the Company's fair value assessment is predicated upon its own history of collection surrounding the specific customers' receivables which have been transferred. Accordingly, such inputs qualify as Level 3 inputs. Due to the high credit quality and the relatively short-term nature of the underlying receivables, fluctuations in credit quality are expected to have an immaterial effect on the fair value of the DPP. Note 15  Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments In connection with the consummation of the Joint Venture with BASF on January 31, 2019, the Company entered into a number of ""take or pay"" contracts (the ""Supply Agreements"") through which BASF will make certain materials required to service acquired BASF legacy customers available to Solenis based upon a combination of legacy BASF volumes for these materials and available manufacturing capacity. The term of these agreements is either three (the ""Medium Term""), or eight years (the ""Long Term""). Upon maturity, each of the Medium Term agreements will automatically extend for 12 months on a revolving basis unless either party provides 24 months notice of their intention to exit the agreement. There is no penalty for either party to exit provided the 24 month notice period is met. Upon maturity, each of the Long Term agreements will expire immediately unless otherwise mutually agreed to by Solenis and BASF. Given the substantial capital and working capital requirements necessary to maintain available capacity and meet Solenis' purchasing requirements, the Company is required to remit minimum monthly payments (the ""Fixed Manufacturing Costs"") designed to cover BASF's plant overhead costs specific to the impacted production lines. The monthly payments are fixed and determinable, based on allocations of BASF's heritage costing structure relative to expected production and volumes and vary only based upon annual changes in inflation rates observable in the public domain. During the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021, and the Predecessor periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, total Fixed Manufacturing Costs incurred were $62.9 million, $6.6 million, $75.2 million and $72.0 million respectively. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Future minimum Fixed Manufacturing Costs as of the Successor Period September 30, 2022 are as follows (in thousands): Severance charges 3,388 Utilization (cash paid or otherwise settled) (5,048) Currency translation (212) Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 1,021 ###### Severance activities during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021, were primarily related to related to cost rationalization projects in connection with the planned ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### synergy objections related to the Acquisition and Contribution, offset by adjustment to prior period accruals related to previous contemplated planned reductions in force.

Solenis' lease portfolio primarily includes non-cancellable agreements which contain automatic extensions, escalating or inflation-linked adjustments to base rental payments, implied or explicit references to non-lease components, and lessor incentives where relevant particularly with respect to large office locations in the United States and Europe. As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted ASC 842 as of October 1, 2020 which requires the capitalization of all fixed future payment obligations greater than one year as lease liabilities, while recognizing the offsetting ability to use or control a specified asset during the lease term as an ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### ROU asset. Through September 30, 2020, the Company accounted for leases under ASC 840, which required only the capitalization of capital (now known as ""finance"") leases. Under ASC 840, assets controlled under capital leases agreements were reflected within Property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while expenses incurred were recognized as either Depreciation expense or Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Dissimilar to finance leases, operating leases were not previously recognized as obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets though expenses incurred were reflected in either Cost of sales, or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the cost incurred. In adopting ASC 842, the Company elected the package of practical expedients in transition which allow primarily for prior conclusions under ASC 840 such as whether non-cancellable agreements contain leases and whether the classification of a given lease is either operating or finance to be carried forward. In determining the opening balance of operating and finance lease liabilities and ROU assets at the transition date, the Company first determined all future fixed payments associated with lease components as well as any unamortized deferred rent or lease incentives; capitalized values were then determined by applying a discount rate equal to the Company's incremental borrowing rate based consistently upon the remaining lease periods and any inflation-linked indexes known at the transition date. For new leases, at contract inception, Solenis reviews the facts and circumstances of an arrangement to determine if the contract is a lease under ASC 842. Primarily, the Company follows the guidance codified in ASC 842-10-15 and considers the following criteria: (1) Whether the contract identified a specific asset for use either explicitly or implicitly and if substitution rights exist, (2) If the Company has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the asset, and (3) If the Company has the right to direct the use of the underlying asset. If determined to contain a lease, the Company proceeds to determine whether the lease is classified as either an operating or finance lease based on an underlying assessment of the substance of ownership and control similar to the finance lease assessment previously completed under ASC 840. Once classification has been determined, the Company will assess the lease term equal to the non-cancellable period of the agreement, together with all of the periods covered by options which are reasonably certain to be exercised. Once classification and term have been identified, total future fixed minimum payments are assessed based on explicitly noted payments inclusive of known escalations, discounts and payment holidays. These future payment streams are then allocated to lease and non-lease components based on the relative standalone price of each. To determine the present value of the future payments assessed as lease components, the Company discounts future fixed payments based upon the rate implicit in the lease agreement or based on the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. When determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company considers the credit profile of the stand-alone legal entity party to the agreement, the impact of any centralized treasury activities, yields on government or corporate bonds of similar duration as the lease term, as well as any country or currency specific risk premiums. The present value of these obligations is then carried as a lease liability offset by an ROU asset. Minimum lease payments under operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term where as finance lease ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis and the related interest expense is recognized on an effective interest method basis. Payments associated with fixed minimum non-lease components are primarily recognized on a straight-line basis while variable payments are expensed as incurred. Most leases within the Company's portfolio are classified as operating leases under ASC 842. These leases primarily include agreements for offices, labs and internally managed warehouses. The current portion of Solenis' operating lease liabilities are included within Accrued expenses, while the long-term portion of the Company's operating lease liabilities, and all of its operating lease ROU assets are presented as stand-alone items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases primarily include fleet vehicles, IT equipment, and embedded lease ROU assets for which the useful life of the related asset is primarily consumed during the lease term. Finance lease liabilities are presented within Current portion of long-term debt and finance leases, and Long term debt and ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### finance leases, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of the Company's long-term leasing obligations is based on the total value of undiscounted payments due within the successive 12 months.

Cash proceeds to extinguish the Predecessor's external debt were made available via Olympus' new term debt and bond offerings which totaled $3.78 billion exclusive of deferred financing costs and original issue discount. As the Predecessor's external debt was paid by Olympus at closing and the debt was not assumed by the buyer, the cash proceeds utilized to extinguish the debt are considered to be a component of the purchase price transferred by Olympus at closing and are presented within Investing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In connection with the extinguishment of the Predecessor's third party debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discount of $59.5 million were written off and recognized as a loss in the Predecessor period within Non operating (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

On April 6, 2022, Olympus Water US Holding Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) obtained an incremental $300 million tranche (the ""Incremental Term Loan USD"") to its existing USD denominated term loans (""Term Loan USD"").

Principal payments of $0.75 million are due quarterly, beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2022.

On August 30, 2022, Olympus Water US Holding Corporation (a consolidated subsidiary of the Company) obtained an incremental $325 million secured USD denominated note (the ""Incremental Secured Notes USD"").

On February 5, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to supplement its First Lien Credit Agreement which resulted in incremental gross proceeds of $150 million and €100 million. The Company used the proceeds to pay down outstanding borrowings on its Revolving Credit facility by the same amount as the incremental proceeds. An incremental debt discount of $1.3 million and incremental deferred financing costs of $1.6 million were capitalized consistent with the guidance prescribed above within ASC 470-50, Modifications and Extinguishments. All other terms of the First Lien Credit Agreement remained consistent, including but not limited to, the outstanding indebtedness thereunder being due June 26, 2025. On March 1, 2021, the Company and its syndicate of lenders agreed to reduce the fixed component of Solenis' debt service costs by 0.25% with respect to the First Lien Euro Loan while replacing the variable rate floor of 0.5% with zero (the ""Repricing""). As the Euro London Interbank Offered Rate (""EURIBOR"") remains negative as of September 30, 2021, this agreement reduced the Company's debt service costs on its First Lien Euro Loan by 0.75%. The transaction is accounted for as a modification. As such, the Company capitalized incremental deferred financing costs of $1.0 million related to lender fees paid in connection with the transaction. First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Company's wholly-owned UK subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions (collectively, the ""Subsidiary Guarantors""), and, solely by recourse to the equity of the Company, by Solenis UK Industries Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Solenis Holdings Sub II B.V. (collectively, the ""Holdings Guarantors""). The First Lien Credit Agreement is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions, as well as the equity of the Company held by the Holdings Guarantors. Principal is paid on the last day of each quarter in an amount equal to $2.8 million and €2.0 million for the First Lien Dollar Loan and First Lien Euro Loan, respectively. Interest rates on all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement are variable. The First Lien Dollar Loan carries an interest rate of 4.00%, plus the greater of the USD London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") or 0%. Beginning on March 1, 2021 in connection with the Repricing, The First Lien Euro Loan carries an interest rate of 4.00% plus the greater of the EURIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months. Term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement mature on June 26, 2025. The Company is permitted to prepay all term loans under the First Lien Credit Agreement at any time. The First Lien Loans are subject to mandatory prepayments equal to 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow, as defined in the First Lien Credit Agreement, subject to certain conditions, beginning in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company made a mandatory principal prepayment of $12.4 million based on the calculation of 50% of the Company's Excess Cash Flow during the year ended September 30, 2020. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### The obligations under the First Lien Credit Agreement are effectively senior to all of the Company's Second Lien Debt and unsecured debt, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such obligations. The Revolving Credit Facility allowed maximum borrowings of $375.0 million and would have matured on June 26, 2023. The interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was at the election of the Borrower, ABR plus 2.5% per annum or LIBOR plus 3.5% per annum. Second Lien Credit Agreement The Second Lien Credit Agreement carries the same guaranty and security package as the First Lien Credit Agreement. No principal payments are due in connection with the Second Lien Credit Agreement until maturity. The Second Lien Credit Agreement matures on June 26, 2026. The Company is permitted to prepay the Second Lien Credit Agreement at any time. Prepayments made prior to June 26, 2020 would have incurred a 2% penalty of the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2020 but prior to June 26, 2021 would have incurred a 1% penalty on the principal balance prepaid. Prepayments made after June 26, 2021 are free of penalty. The prepayment penalty is assessed regardless of whether or not the prepayment was mandatory or voluntary. Through November 8, 2021, the Company had not made any prepayments relative to the Second Lien Credit Agreement. The interest rate on the Second Lien Credit Agreement is 8.5% plus the greater of LIBOR or 0%. Interest elections are made on the last day of the second month of every quarter and are effective for three months. The Second Lien Credit Agreement is junior in priority to the First Lien Credit Agreement and senior to all other unsecured debt. The Second Lien Credit Agreement includes customary negative and affirmative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company's ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) create liens; (iii) make certain investments, loans and advances; (iv) sell assets; (v) pay dividends or make distributions or other restricted payments; (vi) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (vii) change the nature of our business. Deferred Financing Costs and Original Issue Discount The composition of Deferred Financing Costs and the Original Issue Discount which remain capitalized as of September 30, 2021 are derived from a variety of sources. Specifically, those sources are as follows: • Financing costs and original issue discount incurred directly with the First and Second Lien Credit agreements, as part of the borrowings completed on June 26, 2018, January 31, 2019, February 5, 2020 and with respect to the Repricing as of March 1, 2021; • Financing costs and original issue discount carried over from the Old Debt related to portions which were determined to be modified. These amounts generally relate to portions of the debt held by lenders who participated in both syndicates comprising the Old Debt and the June 26, 2018 borrowing; • Financing fees paid in connection with December 31, 2019 Equipment Financing. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### As of September 30, 2021, unamortized deferred financing costs relative to the Company’s outstanding debt consisted of the following (in thousands):",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Qualifying employees participate in specific defined-benefit pension plans, which typically provide pension payments based on an employee’s length of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding retirement or have a cash balance design. Additionally, the Company also assumed various long-term employee health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees in connection with the Acquisition and Contribution. These programs are noncontributory and other programs share the cost with retirees through payment of premiums, deductibles and coinsurance provisions.

The Company believes that these instruments qualify as Level 2 measurements. The carrying amounts of the remainder of Solenis' debt and finance lease obligations approximate fair value due to their primarily short-term nature. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Successor Olympus is not party to any plain vanilla derivatives or hedging activities. The Company maintains a variety of long-term supply agreements with BASF, it's legacy JV partner during the Predecessor period. Certain of these supply agreements were extended at or around the closing of the the Acquisition and Contribution, and are accounted for as embedded finance leases as of, and during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022.

The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. During the first quarter of 2019, the Company entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variable interest rate risk exposure specific to the Company's First Lien US Dollar-denominated debt. The aggregate notional value for the three interest rate swap agreements is $600.0 million. As a result of these arrangements, the Company collectively converted $600.0 million of its US Dollar-denominated debt from a floating three-month LIBOR interest rate to fixed rates of 3.26%, 3.12%, and 3.13%, respectively for the 36- month period from May 31, 2019 through May 31, 2022. These contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. On both a retrospective and prospective basis, the Company measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing, at least quarterly, the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss or income until the settlement of the related business transaction at which time the accumulated gain or loss from the contracts will be reclassified into earnings. There was no ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument recognized during the predecessor period. For the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021 Solenis reclassified expense of $9.2 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Non operating (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2021 and Predecessor period ended September 30, 2020 Solenis reclassified expense of $18.0 million and $12.6 million, respectively from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations based on the paid and accrued interest recognized on the Company's interest rate swap liability. In connection with the Acquisition, the indebtedness held by the Predecessor company was fully repaid and as a result the interest rate swaps were effectively settled. Solenis repaid $11.1 million of interest rate swap liabilities and reclassified expense of $9.2 million from Accumulated other comprehensive loss through Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Predecessor period. The following table presents the location and fair values using Level 2 inputs of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands):",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

As of September 30, 2021, the Company had First Lien Euro Loans of $899.8 million (EUR 777.2 million). To mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with these loans on a go-forward basis, management determined to pursue solutions without incurring the cost or underlying risks associated with derivative financial instruments. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Effective April 1, 2021, the Company determined to utilize an intercompany Euro denominated note between two downstream consolidated subsidiaries to act as a hedging instrument in response to the foreign exchange risk associated with the Company's consolidated EUR net asset exposure (i.e. the ""hedged item""). The intercompany note will act as a ""net investment hedge"" through which changes in the USD equivalent of the intercompany note will be recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) rather than through the Consolidated Statements of Operations as is common for foreign currency denominated monetary instruments. The use of an intercompany note is permissible under ASC 815-20, Derivatives, only to the extent that the intercompany note reflects the consolidated foreign exchange risk of the consolidated company, and the entity party to the third-party debt instrument is the counterparty to the intercompany note designated as a hedging instrument. As of April 1, 2021 and through November 8, 2021, Solenis meets both of these criteria required to assume a net investment hedge. Each month, Solenis redesignates a specific amount of Euro denominated intercompany notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate foreign exchange risk associated with its Euro net assets. The Company's designation is limited to the lowest value in the subset of data points among: 1) The total Euro value of the intercompany note outstanding, 2) The total Euro value of Solenis' consolidated First Lien Euro Loans, and 3) The total Euro value of Solenis' net assets in consolidated subsidiaries that utilize a Euro functional currency. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had designated EUR 777.2 million of its intercompany Euro notes as a hedging instrument to mitigate the foreign currency risk associated with the Company's $816.1 million of consolidated Euro net assets (relative to total First Lien Euro Loans of EUR 777.2 million). During the year ended September 30, 2021, Solenis recognized Other comprehensive income of $10.4 million as a result of its net investment hedge, effectively representing deferrals of foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the Company's First Lien Euro Loans. No reclassifications of Other comprehensive income (loss) specific to the net investment hedge are expected to be reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the next 12 months. During the Predecessor period November 8, 2021, the Company deferred incremental unrealized gains on its EUR term loans of $1.1 million to Other Comprehensive Income. In connection with the settlement of its existing debt for the Olympus closing which removes the underlying hedged item critical to ensure the effectiveness of the Net Investment Hedge, the Company reclassified the $10.4 million and $1.1 million of unrealized gains deferred in the collective Predecessor periods (total of $11.5 million) to realized gains within Non operating expense (income), net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Assets and Liabilities Measured Using Level 3 Inputs The following table presents activity of assets and liabilities valued using Level 3 inputs by line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets from September 30, 2020 to September 30, 2022 (in thousands):",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Stock Incentive Plan pursuant to which the Company's board of directors shall select officers and key employees and directors to participate in the plan and grant stock options and offer opportunities to purchase shares. The plan allows for the issuance of up to 6,500,000 Class B shares under the plan (for all share-based compensation and share purchases). All stock options granted have a term not greater than ten years. Stock options vest and become exercisable, in whole or in part, with vesting conditions set by the Company's Board of Directors. The options are provided in two separate grants which have differing vesting conditions. Service Options vest in four equal annual installments, coinciding with the first anniversary date of the grant date and each successive anniversary thereafter. Performance Options vest upon the conclusion of each of the four fiscal years subsequent to the grant date based on the achievement of specified ""EBITDA"" (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; subject to management adjustments) targets during the fiscal year in which they vest. The extent of vesting is based on the Company's financial performance relative to EBITDA targets stipulated by the Board of Directors. The vesting of both Service and Performance Options are contingent upon continuous employment through the respective measurement dates. On January 31, 2019, the Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. Stock Incentive Plan was superseded by the Solenis UK International Limited Stock Incentive Plan (""the Plan"") as part of the closing of the Joint Venture. All outstanding Service Options to purchase shares in Solenis Holdings Top II B.V. were converted to options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. Service Options which were vested were exchanged for fully vested options. Unvested Service Options were exchanged for Service Options with identical vesting periods to the canceled awards. In connection with the JV, all holders of Class A and B shares were provided with a return of capital conveyed in cash to facilitate the required equity holdings amongst the JV participants (CD&R, BASF and management shareholders). In addition, and to uphold the anti-dilutive provision of the Plan, the intrinsic value of all Class B options was kept constant through a reduction of option exercise prices equal to the per-share value of the return of capital conveyed to all Class A and B equity holders. In circumstances where this was not possible due to limitations under Section 409(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company compensated option holders in cash totaling $4.4 million. This cash is considered to be a return of capital and presented as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### The Company applied the guidance prescribed by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, to determine the appropriate accounting treatment regarding the cancellation of the old awards and simultaneous grant of new awards. Based on the prescribed guidance, the Company determined that the two transactions, in combination, represent a modification of the original award. Subsequent accounting for modifications is predicated upon the fair value of the original award immediately before and the new award immediately after the modification. Management's analysis concluded that the fair value of the new award did not exceed the fair value of the old award on the modification date. Therefore, the Company will continue to ratably recognize the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for the original awards based on the fair value of the awards as of the original grant date over the remaining vesting period. In connection with the Acquisition all unvested Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock Units issued under the Predecessor Stock Plan immediately vested in accordance with the Change in Control provisions within the Solenis UK International Limited Stock Incentive Plan. All Stock Options and SARs were immediately canceled on November 9, 2021 in exchange for cash pursuant to each option holders's intrinsic value on the Acquisition.  All unvested Restricted Stock Units were immediately canceled exchanged for cash. All payments were made net of applicable employee taxes and withholdings. Solenis recognized $14.2 million of compensation expense in the Predecessor period ending November 8, 2021 related to Stock Options, RSUs and SARs. The Change in Control did not create a stock modification event, therefore, there was no incremental expense, other than the unrecognized compensation as of September 30, 2021, for stock options and the immediate vesting of the RSU's. Stock Options Stock incentive plan allows stock option grants for shares at a price based on the most recent valuation of the Company's ordinary shares at the time of the grant and may be subject to anti-dilution. Stock options under the plan become exercisable over four equal annual installments. Every option equals one share. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Share-based compensation expense is recognized as a component of Selling, general, and administrative expense. The Company records compensation expense related to all stock awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards. Compensation expense for Service Options is recognized over the requisite service period, while expense for Performance Options is recognized over the performance period based on successful achievement of performance-based conditions or targets. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Stock option activity for Service and Performance Options from September 30, 2020 through November 8, 2021 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands except for per option data):",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

There were no stock options exercised in the period ending November 8, 2021 and therefore, there was no cash received. Stock Appreciation Rights Certain employees were granted Stock Appreciation Rights (""SARs""), representing stock awards to be settled in cash. The Company recognized these as liability-classified awards in accordance with ASC 718. Consistent with our equity based awards, the Company has SARs which vest in accordance with service (""Service SARs"") and performance (""Performance SARs"") conditions. SAR based compensation is included as a part of Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Like the Service Options, Service SARs originally issued as part of the Plan which participated in the appreciation of the price of Class B Shares were converted to rights to participate in share price appreciation of the Company's Ordinary shares. Strike prices were revised in accordance with the Plan's anti-dilution provision. No Performance SARs have been granted during period ending November 8, 2021. Stock appreciation rights issued under the plan are remeasured to fair value at each reporting date using Black- Scholes inputs applicable at the reporting date. Differences in fair value between reporting dates are recognized in earnings as part of Selling, general, and administrative expense to the extent that awards have vested or are expected to vest. Restricted Stock Units In February 2020, certain members of the management team were granted a total of 1.1 million Restricted Stock Units (""2020 RSU"") with a term of seven years and vesting contingent upon a combination of a liquidation event (Performance Obligation), the implied per-share equity value of the liquidation event at a pre-defined minimum threshold amount (Market Condition), and that a grantee continues to render service until the date of the liquidation event (Service Condition). Vesting of the RSU's range between 70% - 100%, where 70% is at minimum pre-defined exit price per share and 100% is at maximum pre-defined exit price per share. In the event of vesting, grantees shall receive cash proceeds within 75 days of the liquidity event. Although, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, the cash proceeds may be required for an equity contribution back to the Company. Grantees that leave the Company either voluntarily or involuntarily prior to vesting conditions are met will forfeit their respective grants. Based upon the vesting conditions of the 2020 RSU awards Solenis was required to value these awards using a valuation method in accordance with the Market Condition definition in ASC 718-10-20. The grant date fair value of the 2020 RSU's was $8.82 per unit. Solenis recognized $9.1 million in stock compensation expense in connection with the vesting of these awards. In March 2021, certain members of the management team were granted a total of 0.5 million RSU's (2021 RSU's) with a term of seven years and vesting contingent upon the Company achieving certain EBITDA targets. Based ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### upon the vesting conditions of the 2021 RSU awards Solenis was required to value these awards using the Black- Scholes simulation in accordance with the Performance Condition definition in ASC 718-10-20. The grant date fair value of the 2020 RSU's was $5.64 per unit. Solenis recognized $2.6 million in stock compensation expense in connection with the vesting of these awards. In accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation, vesting of these awards is contingent upon performance obligations and market conditions which are outside of management's control and such conditions cannot be assumed or estimated based on lack of history and potential outcomes. As the likelihood of achievement of the Performance condition cannot be assessed as ""probable"", no compensation expense will be recognized until the performance condition is achieved. Note 18  Restructuring and Severance Activities The Company's strategic growth objectives either through acquisition or organic opportunities are partially driven by cost synergies which reduce the long-term costs required to serve Solenis' customers. These long-term cost synergies are often actioned through specific reductions in force. As a result of these programs, Solenis incurred severance charges of $3.4 million during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 as well as less than $0.1 million, $5.5 million and $21.3 million during the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 and the Predecessor periods ended September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. Of the total severance charges incurred, the amounts reflected within Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were $0.6 million during the Successor period ended September 30, 2022 and less than $0.1 million in each of the other three Predecessor periods.

Relationship with BASF On January 31, 2019 as part of the JV, Solenis entered into a management and consulting arrangement with BASF pursuant to which BASF provides, on a nonexclusive basis, management, consulting and advisory services to Solenis and certain of its divisions and subsidiaries. Under the agreement, Solenis was required to pay an annual advisory fee in the amount of $3.5 million.

Solenis had $13.6 million and $5.3 million in interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. The Company recognized deferred tax assets in the Predecessor period ending September 30, 2018 related to tax benefits attributable to intercompany mergers. During 2018, the Company discovered that statutorily related filing requirements had not been timely filed. While the Company intends to pursue the matter through available legal channels, the benefits do not meet the criteria for recognition resulting in an Unrecognized Tax Benefit and similarly has not recognized benefit for the 2018 transaction. As of the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, the Company has recorded incremental penalties and interest as a result of the previously Unrecognized Tax Benefits from the 2018 transaction. Solenis or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.

With respect to countries outside of the United States, with certain exceptions, Solenis’ foreign subsidiaries are subject to income tax audits for years after 2015. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on cumulative earnings of non-U.S. affiliates and associated companies that have been reinvested indefinitely. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and, as of the Successor period of September 30, 2022, were $32.5M. These earnings have been reinvested in active non-US business operations and the Company does not intend to repatriate these earnings to the parent entity to fund operations. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. Deferred taxes have been provided for earnings of affiliates and associated companies where the Company plans to remit those earnings. ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Switzerland Tax Reform The Swiss government has enacted comprehensive tax legislation referred to as The Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), which included significant changes to the Swiss corporate income tax system. Most notable among the changes is the phase out of the mixed company regime and a corresponding increase in the cantonal tax rate. During the Successor period ended September 30, 2022, the Company received a Swiss tax ruling that granted a step up on hidden reserves that can be utilized to effectively offset the increased tax rate. The Company has recorded the corresponding impact of these items in the consolidated financial statements for the Successor period ended September 30, 2022. COVID-19 Legislation During the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2020, tax relief legislation was passed in a number of countries to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the United States’ Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was enacted on March 27, 2020. The Company evaluated the legislative provisions in the CARES Act and implemented a number of changes deemed applicable, including the temporary increase of the interest expense limitation from 30% to 50%, the temporary removal of the 80% limitation on net operating losses, and the temporary deferral of the Company's social security tax responsibilities. The Company has reflected the impact of these changes within its consolidated financial statements for the Predecessor year ended September 30, 2021. No impact has been recorded for the Predecessor period ended November 8, 2021 and Successor period ended September 30, 2022, as these provisions have expired. Note 23  Hyperinflationary Economies On May 16, 2018 and on March 16, 2022, the International Practices Task Force categorized Argentina and Turkey, respectively, as countries with highly-inflationary economies. Accounting Standards Codification 830, Foreign Currency Matters, requires entities domiciled in these jurisdictions to change their functional currency to the reporting currency of its parent entity on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter after this determination has been made. The Company consolidates wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina and Turkey for which the functional currency of these entities has historically matched their respective local currencies. Solenis Argentina, S.A. (""Solenis Argentina"") and Solenis Turkey Kimya Limited Sirketi (""Solenis Turkey"") sell direct to end customers exclusively in their domestic markets. The Company does not have manufacturing facilities in either subsidiary and accordingly, the majority of its net assets are current to support local distribution activities.

Unrecognized tax benefits U.S. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the accounting and financial statements disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.

Note 24 Deconsolidation of Subsidiaries On January 4, 2021, the directors of Solenis Trinidad and Tobago Limited, a subsidiary of the Company (""Solenis Trinidad""), passed a special resolution to commence liquidation procedures via a voluntary members winding-up. To facilitate the liquidation, the directors appointed a third-party administrator on the same date and effectively relinquished control of Solenis Trinidad. As such and in accordance with ASC 810-10-40- Consolidation (and Derecognition), management determined the loss of control requires the deconsolidation of the subsidiary and a write-off of the previously consolidated net assets. Upon deconsolidation, Solenis recorded a loss of $18 million in the Predecessor prior fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. In consideration of the liquidation efforts, Solenis recorded the residual fair value of its non-controlling interest of $2.5 million, equal to the value of cash on hand and other net working capital items controlled by the administrator which were previously reflected on the balance sheets of Solenis Trinidad in consolidation. The fair value of the non-controlling interest is reflected within Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the Successor Period September 30, 2022, and the Predecessor Period September 30, 2021. Management anticipates the liquidation procedures will be completed by December 31, 2022. Resulting from the liquidation, Management reviewed the criteria for the presentation of results within discontinued operations as reflected within ASC 205-20, Discontinued Operations, noting that Solenis Trinidad represents less than 1% of the Company's total assets and annualized revenues and accordingly, the liquidation does not represent a strategic shift required to present items within discontinued operations. Accordingly, the results of Solenis Trinidad are reflected in the Company's consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to January 4, 2021. |Successor|Predecessor| |---|---| |For the period from November 9, 2021 to September 30,|For the period For the year For the year from October 1 to ended September ended September November 8, 30, 30,| |2022|2021 2021 2020| |$ 2,325|$ — $ 1,501 $ 3,247| ----- ##### Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ###### Note 25  Subsequent Events.

The COVID-19 pandemic further reinforced the essential nature of our solutions and increased hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning standards across all markets. The product range of Diversey®-branded solutions includes fully integrated lines of products and dispensing systems for hard surface cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, hand washing, deodorizing, mechanical and manual ware washing, hard surface and carpeted floor cleaning systems, cleaning tools and utensils, fabric care for professional laundry applications comprising detergents, stain removers, bleaches and a broad range of dispensing equipment for process control and management information systems. Floor care machines are commercialized under the well-established Taski® brand.

The new guidance is expected to improve the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient qualitative and quantitative information about the program to allow a user of its financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential magnitude. ASU No. 2022-04 is effective for us as of January 1, 2023 on a retrospective basis including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement to disclose roll-forward information, which is effective for us as of January 1, 2024.

In addition, we offer a wide range of value-added solutions, including food safety and application training and consulting, as well as auditing of hygiene and water management. Many of our products are sold through distributors who then sell the product to end users. We recognize revenue based on the expected amount of consideration to be received for the provided goods or services, taking into account the expected value of variable consideration. Our variable considerations include, but are not limited to, rebates, prebates, discounts, and returns. The amount of variable consideration is estimated at contract inception by using the most likely amount method depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Such variable consideration is re-evaluated each reporting period, and accruals are booked based on the re-evaluated estimates and variable consideration recognized to date. Charges for rebates and other allowances are recognized as a deduction from revenue on an accrual basis in the period in which the associated revenue is recorded. When we estimate our rebate accruals, we consider customer-specific contractual commitments including stated rebate rates and history of actual rebates paid. Our rebate accruals are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted to reflect data available at that time. We adjust the accruals to reflect any differences between estimated and actual amounts. These adjustments impact the amount of net sales recognized by us in the corresponding period of adjustment. Charges for rebates and other allowances were 28.6% and 24.9% of gross sales for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, establishing credit limits, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. It is our policy to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 or higher by Moody’s. Nevertheless, there is a risk that our exposure to losses arising out of derivative contracts could be material if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations. We will replace counterparties if a credit downgrade is deemed to increase our risk to unacceptable levels. We regularly monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our diverse base of customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business and generally do not require collateral. We consider the concentrations of credit risk associated with our trade accounts receivable to be commercially reasonable and believe that such concentrations do not leave us vulnerable to significant risks of near-term severe adverse impacts. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer.

The changes in fair value of these hedging instruments offset in part or in whole corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. We assess the initial and ongoing effectiveness of our hedging relationships in accordance with our policy. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Tax effects of significant unusual or infrequently occurring items are excluded from the estimated annual effective tax rate calculation and recognized in the interim period in which they occur. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we utilized the discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by ASC 740-270-30-18, “Income Taxes—Interim Reporting,” to calculate our interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year to date period as if it was the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis.

Management reviews its indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1st of each year or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset may not be recoverable. The Company performed a quantitative approach to test for impairment based on the relief from royalty method. Auditing management’s annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test required the application of greater auditor judgment. Auditing management’s indefinite-lived intangible impairment analyses was complex and judgmental due to the estimation required in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In particular, the fair value estimates included significant assumptions for the revenue growth rates and the discount rate which are affected by expectations about macroeconomic and industry specific factors. We evaluated the Company’s assessment of the impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement related to the indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test, including management’s development and review of the significant assumptions discussed above. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible asset, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing fair value methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. For example, we compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and the Company’s historical trends with consideration given to changes in the Company’s business, customer base and other ----- relevant factors. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s projected revenue growth estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value that would result from changes in these assumptions. We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s valuation model, which included clerical testing of the valuation model and agreement of prospective financial information within the model to the Company’s internal forecasts.

The Company’s goodwill is initially assigned to its reporting units as of the acquisition date. Management reviews goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1st of each year or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performed a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether there was a greater than 50 percent likelihood that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment test required the application of greater auditor judgment. Qualitative events and circumstances, such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, market capitalization and events specific to the entity and its reporting units, required a higher degree of auditor judgment to evaluate. These events and circumstances could have a significant effect on the Company’s qualitative assessment and the determination of whether further quantitative analysis of goodwill for impairment was required. We evaluated the Company’s assessment of the impairment of goodwill. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement related to the goodwill impairment test, including management’s development and review of the qualitative factors discussed above. To test the qualitative assessment of the Company’s reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, considering macroeconomic indicators; evaluating ----- information from third-party analyst reports across the manufacturing and hygiene solutions industries; analyzing the financial performance of the consolidated Company and reporting units including comparison to guideline public companies in the same industry; and recalculating the Company’s market capitalization and reporting unit carrying value. We further assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates of future financial performance, changes in estimated future cash flows, and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, such as projected future cash flows and discount rate, to evaluate if changes in these inputs could indicate that the fair value of the reporting units were more likely than not less than the carrying value. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in our evaluation of the significance and sensitivity of the significant assumptions most likely to affect the fair value of the reporting units. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.

In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Diversey Holdings, Ltd. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses in the design and operation of controls related to existence of inventory held at certain locations and controls over the timing of revenue recognition and certain information used to estimate customer rebate accruals within the Company’s revenue recognition process. As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Shorrock Trichem Ltd., which is included in the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 1.4% and 7.2% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 1.3% and 1.6% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.

We develop mission-critical products, services and technologies that save lives and protect our environment. We were formed as an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands with limited liability, on November 3, 2020 for the purpose of completing a public offering and related transactions and in order to carry on the business of our indirect wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. On March 29, 2021, we completed an initial public offering of 46,153,846 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $15.00 per Ordinary Share (""the IPO""), receiving $654.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses. On April 9, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,000,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, receiving an incremental $71.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.

Prior to the formation of Diversey Holdings, Ltd., the organizational structure consisted of Constellation (BC) 2 S.à r.l (""Constellation""), which was incorporated on June 30, 2017, and organized under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société à Responsabilité Limitée for an unlimited period under the direction of Bain Capital, LP (“Bain Capital”). Diamond (BC) B.V., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation, was formed on March 15, 2017 for the purpose of consummating the acquisition of the Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business of Sealed Air Corporation (“Sealed Air”) (together, the “Diversey Business”), including certain assets and all the capital stock of certain entities engaged in the Diversey Business (the “Diversey Acquisition”), which acquisition closed on September 6, 2017. Prior to closing of the IPO, we effected a series of transactions (the ""Reorganization Transactions"") pursuant to which: (i) Constellation (BC) PoolCo SCA (“Poolco”), an entity incorporated for the purpose of pooling the interests of our employees, directors and officers in Constellation (BC) S.à r.l (“Topco”), a direct subsidiary of Constellation, repurchased shares from certain equity holders in exchange for a note receivable; (ii) all other equity holders of Poolco contributed their shares of Poolco to Constellation in exchange for new shares of Constellation; and (iii) the equity holders of Constellation, including Bain Capital and the individuals referred to in the foregoing clause (ii), contributed a portion of their shares of Constellation to the Company, and the equity holders referred to in the foregoing clause (i) contributed a portion of their note receivable to the Company, in each case, in exchange for ordinary shares of the Company (in which the Company withheld a portion of the ordinary shares otherwise issuable solely to the extent necessary to satisfy (y) any outstanding loans owned by such employee equity holders and (z) any tax consequences resulting to the equity holders from the repurchase, and the aggregate fair market value of such withheld ordinary shares will be paid by the Company or a subsidiary thereof to satisfy such tax consequence), and the equity holders of Constellation, including Bain Capital and the individuals referred to in the foregoing clause (ii), contributed the remaining portion of their shares of Constellation to one of our subsidiaries, and the equity holders referred to in the foregoing clause (i) contributed the remaining portion of their note receivable to one of our subsidiaries, in each case, in exchange for payments to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement entered into in connection with the IPO and certain other consideration. The Reorganization Transactions resulted in the Company becoming the ultimate parent company of Constellation and its subsidiaries, and Bain Capital and all other equity holders of Constellation and Poolco becoming ----- shareholders of the Company. In order to simplify our corporate structure, we merged or liquidated certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Constellation, Poolco and Topco, prior to December 31, 2021.

These estimates include, among other items, purchase price accounting, assessing the collectability of receivables, the use and recoverability of inventory, the estimation of the fair value of financial instruments, useful lives and recoverability of tangible and intangible assets and impairment of goodwill, assumptions used in our defined benefit pension plans and other post ----- employment benefit plans, fair value measurement of assets, rebate costs, costs for incentive compensation, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and accruals for commitments and contingencies.

Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Fair value determination is subject to a significant degree of estimates. We use a measurement period following the acquisition date to gather information that existed as of the acquisition date that is needed to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The measurement period ends once all information is obtained, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessments of factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition. Where appropriate, external advisors are consulted to assist in the determination of fair value. For non-observable market values, fair value has been determined using acceptable valuation principles (e.g., multiple excess earnings and relief from royalty methods) which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value. Refer to Note 12 - Fair Value Measurements and Other Financial Instruments for further information.

We may also use these financial instruments from time to time to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not purchase, hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. We face credit risk if the counterparties to these transactions are unable to perform their obligations. Our policy is to have counterparties to these contracts that are rated at least BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and Baa3 by Moody’s. Derivative instruments are reported at fair value and establish criteria for designation and the effectiveness of transactions entered into for hedging purposes. Before entering into any derivative transaction, we identify the specific financial risk, the appropriate hedging instrument to use to reduce this risk, and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. We use forecasts and historical data as the basis for determining the anticipated values of the transactions to be hedged. We do not enter into derivative transactions that do not have a high correlation with the underlying financial risk trying to be reduced. We regularly review hedge positions and the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments. Derivative instruments are accounted for as hedges of the related underlying risks if we designate these derivative instruments as hedges and the derivative instruments are effective as hedges of recognized assets or liabilities, forecasted transactions, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted intercompany transactions. We record gains and losses on derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income (loss) to the extent that hedges are effective and until the underlying transactions are recognized as gains or losses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Generally, our practice is to terminate derivative transactions if the underlying asset or liability matures, is sold or terminated, or if it is determined that the underlying forecasted transactions are no longer probable of occurring. Any deferred gains or losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the period in which the income or expense on the underlying hedged transaction was recognized.

Revenue from service and leased equipment is recognized when the services are provided, or the customer receives the benefit from the leased equipment, which is over time. Service revenue is recognized over time utilizing an input method and aligns with when the services are provided and corresponds with the transfer of control.

653_1,Preliminary Offerings 2023.md,1080,NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION,1080.21,Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets,1080.21.1,,"Goodwill is initially assigned to reporting units as of the acquisition date. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets. Our goodwill had a carrying value of $462.8 million and $471.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of the Diversey trade name, had a carrying value of $818.2 million and $854.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We review goodwill for possible impairment on a reporting unit level, which are consistent with our operating segments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed on an annual basis as of October 1st of each year, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset has declined below its carrying value. Such events may include, but are not limited to, impairment of other assets or establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, cash flow or operating losses at a reporting unit, negative current events or long-term outlooks for our industry, and negative adjustments to future forecasts. In performing the annual goodwill impairment assessment, we have the option under U.S. GAAP to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we conclude from the qualitative assessment that there are no indicators of impairment, we do not perform a quantitative test, which would require a valuation of the reporting unit as of October 1. U.S. GAAP provides a set of qualitative factors such as macroeconomic, industry, market and company specific factors, including cost factors, overall financial performance, market capitalization, and other events specific to the Company to consider in performing the qualitative assessment described above, which factors are not all inclusive; management considers the factors it deems relevant in making its more likely than not assessments. If we conclude from our qualitative assessment that there are indicators of impairment and that a quantitative test is required, the annual or interim quantitative goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill to its carrying value, including the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no impairment and no further testing is required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount of the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Our annual assessment of the recovery of goodwill begins with management’s reassessment of its operating segments and reporting units. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, which is referred to as a component. This reassessment of reporting units is also made each time we change our operating segments. If the goodwill of a reporting unit is allocated to newly-formed reporting units, the allocation is made to each reporting unit based upon their relative fair values. Based on the results of our 2022 and 2021 annual qualitative assessments, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value. As such, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that our reporting units were not impaired. ----- For our 2020 annual assessment, we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the quantitative test, which did not identify any impairment. As of December 31, 2020, the estimate of the excess of fair value over carrying value was greater than 20.0% of the fair value for both of our reporting units. The fair value of our reporting units is determined using both an income approach, which is based on discounted cash flows (“DCF”), and a market approach when we quantitatively test goodwill for impairment, either on an interim basis or annual basis as of October 1 of each year. Significant judgments inherent in using a DCF analysis include the selection of appropriate discount and long-term growth rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The expected cash flows used in the DCF analyses are based on our most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted growth rates. The discount rates and growth rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows of the respective reporting units. Assumptions used in the DCF analyses, including the discount rate and the long-term growth rate, are assessed based on each reporting unit's current results and forecasted future performance, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors, and reflect our best estimate as of the impairment testing date. Any changes in such assumptions or estimates as a result of changes in our budgets, forecasts or negative macroeconomic trends could significantly affect the value of our reporting units which could impact whether an impairment of goodwill has occurred. The discount rate used in the quantitative test for determining the fair value of our reporting units was 9.0% in 2020. Determining fair value using a market approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of companies. From the comparable companies, a representative market multiple is determined which is applied to financial metrics to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine a peer group of companies for our respective reporting units, we considered companies relevant in terms of consumer use, monetization model, margin and growth characteristics, and brand strength operating in their respective sectors. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment equal to the excess is recorded. The 2022, 2021 and 2020 annual assessments of the indefinite-lived intangible asset did not identify any impairments. When performing a quantitative test, we determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset using a relief from royalty DCF valuation analysis. Significant judgments inherent in this analysis include the selection of appropriate royalty and discount rates and estimating the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in the DCF analyses are intended to reflect the risks inherent in the expected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets. The royalty rates used in the DCF analyses are based upon an estimate of the royalty rates that a market participant would pay to license our trade names. The future cash flows are based on our most recent forecast and budget and, for years beyond the budget, our estimates, which are based, in part, on forecasted revenue growth rates. Assumptions used in the relief from royalty DCF analyses, including the discount rate and royalty rate, are assessed annually based on the actual and projected cash flows related to the asset, as well as macroeconomic and industry specific factors. The discount rates used in our annual indefinite-lived impairment assessment was 9.5% in 2022 and 9.0% in 2020, and the royalty rate used in 2022 and 2020 was 3.0%. Based on the results of our 2021 annual qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeded the carrying value. As such, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment analysis, and we concluded that the indefinite-lived intangible asset was not impaired. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and the indefinite-lived intangible asset involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected operating income margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, or other factors could negatively affect the fair value of our reporting units or the indefinite-lived intangible asset and result in a material impairment charge in the future. -----",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

Such long-lived assets primarily consist of definite-lived intangible assets in an aggregate amount of $1,165.9 million and $1,292.6 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. We perform an impairment review for definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships, contracts, intellectual property, and for other long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Such events may include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price of an asset or asset group, change in manner in which an asset is being used, significant change in business climate and significant cash flow or operating losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the use of the asset. We calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group and compare this estimated amount to the carrying value of the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount is found to be greater than the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows of the asset or asset group, we record an impairment loss of the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the asset or asset group. In addition, we re-evaluate the remaining useful lives of the assets and modify them, as appropriate. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives. The reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets is regularly evaluated. Once these assets are fully amortized, they are removed from the balance sheet.

Our operating leases include vehicles, buildings, equipment, material handling, storage and land. Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the term. The operating lease right-of-use asset also includes accrued lease expense resulting from the straight-line accounting under prior accounting methods, which is now being amortized over the remaining life of the lease. Our finance leases relate to vehicles and equipment. Our lease payments consist of fixed payments and variable payments. We determine our variable payments based on an index or a rate (i.e. CPI or a market interest rate) that is initially measured at the commencement date. Fixed payments are both fixed and in-substance payments, less any lease incentives paid or payable. Some of our leases include options to extend the lease, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to five years. If we are reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, the extension period is included as part of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability. Our leases do not contain residual value guarantees, which are guarantees made to the lessor that the value of an underlying asset returned to the lessor at the end of a lease will be at least a specified amount. Our leases do not contain restrictions or covenants that restrict us from incurring other financial obligations. At the inception of our contracts we determine if the contract is or contains a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The discount rate for leases is determined based on the incremental borrowing rate (""IBR""). Our IBR is based on information available on the lease commencement date to determine the present value of future payments. For our leases, we have not elected to not apply the recognition requirements to leases of twelve months or less.

The projected benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost are based on third-party actuarial assumptions and estimates that are reviewed and approved by management on a planby-plan basis each fiscal year. The principal assumptions concern the discount rate used to measure future obligations, the expected future rate of return on plan assets and the expected rate of future compensation increases. We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends and market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits. In determining the discount rate, we utilize market conditions and other data sources management considers reasonable based upon the profile of the remaining service life of eligible employees. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by taking into consideration the weighted-average expected return on our asset allocation, asset return data, historical return data, and the economic environment. We believe these considerations provide the basis for reasonable assumptions of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The rate of compensation increase is based on our long-term plans for such increases. The measurement date used to determine benefit obligations and plan assets is December 31.

The TRA requires us to make payments to the TRA Recipients as part of the consideration for their shares in Constellation or as part consideration for the note receivable held by them, as applicable, for 85% of the tax benefits realized by us when utilizing certain U.S. and Dutch income tax attributes generated, or owned by, or attributable to, us on or prior to the date of the IPO, and any tax deductions available to us that relate to the transaction expenses incurred by us as a result of the consummation of the IPO. We expect to utilize a significant portion of these income tax attributes based on current projections of taxable income, and therefore, expects to realize tax benefits. The annual tax benefits are computed by calculating the income taxes due, including such tax benefits, and the income taxes due without such tax benefits. Under the TRA, generally, we will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of the applicable tax savings.

The payment obligations under the TRA are our obligations and are not obligations of Constellation. Payments are generally due within a specified period of time following the filing of our annual tax return and interest on such payments will accrue from the original due date (without extensions) of the income tax return until the date paid. Payments not made within the required period after the filing of the income tax return generally accrue interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.00% (subject to a 50 bps LIBOR floor and subject to change if LIBOR is no longer a widely recognized benchmark rate). The TRA will remain in effect until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless we exercise our right to terminate the TRA. The TRA will also terminate if we breach our obligations under the TRA or upon certain mergers, asset sales, certain forms of business combinations, or other changes of control. If we exercise our right to terminate the TRA, or if the TRA is terminated early in accordance with its terms, our payment obligations would be accelerated based upon certain assumptions, including the assumption that we would have sufficient future taxable income to utilize such tax benefits.",N/A,as_expected,2023,612

We expect to incur approximately $138.0 million of total costs related to this project, and charged $120.0 million over the life of the project and $111.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. Costs incurred in 2022 of $27.1 million are reflected in restructuring and exit costs and $84.8 million of non-recurring other costs related to facilities consolidations are reflected in Cost of sales. Our remaining costs for this project are approximately $18.5 million at December 31, 2022. Cost estimates for these projects have been impacted by an inflationary macro environment with constraints around materials, freight and labor. Extraordinary short-term measures were taken to minimize disruption to customers. These measures include lengthening warehouse leases, temporarily setting up additional warehouses, paying higher freight costs during warehouse transitions and paying carriers to guarantee delivery. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred restructuring costs related to a reduction in headcount to realign our personnel resources with our business needs, which was aimed at maintaining a competitive cost structure and workforce optimization. We also exited certain businesses in 2021 that leased equipment to customers under sales-type leases, as we further refine our business model and our strategy of selling solutions to customers.
