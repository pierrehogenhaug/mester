**RISK FACTORS**

_Prior to making an investment decision, prospective investors should consider carefully all of the_
_information set out and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus, including in particular the_
_following risk factors. Prospective investors should be aware that this section is not intended to be_
_exhaustive and that the risks described herein may combine and thus modify one another. They should_
_make their own independent evaluations of all risk factors and should also read the detailed_
_information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus. Terms defined in "Terms and Conditions of the_
_Notes" below shall have the same meaning in the following section._

**1.** **RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE ISSUER**

Risk factors relating to the Issuer and its activity are set forth in pages 70 to 79 of the 2015 Reference
Document incorporated by reference into this Prospectus, which the investors are kindly advised to
consider, and include the following:

- Legal risks:

    - Antitrust investigations and Proceedings underway;

    - Other compliance risk;

    - Risks related to claims and litigation;

- Business-related risks:

    - Risks related to contractual liability, in particular client claims related to product
liability and budget over-runs and late delivery penalties in relation to turnkey
projects;

    - Risks related to dependence on customers;

    - Risks related to raw materials and supplies;

    - Risks related to external growth;

    - Geopolitical risks;

    - Risks related to competitive environment of the Group's operating subsidiaries;

    - Risks related to technologies used;

    - Industrial and environmental risks;

    - Risks related to talent loss and reorganizations; and

    - Asbestos.

- Financial risks

    - Liquidity risks;

    - Interest rate and foreign exchange risks;

    - Metal price risks;

    - Credit risk and counterparty risk.

The risks described in the 2015 Reference Document incorporated by reference into this Prospectus
are the risks that, at the date hereof, the Group believes could have a material adverse effect on its
earnings, financial position and outlook if they occurred. Nexans may be exposed to other risks that
were unidentified as of the date of this Prospectus, or which are not currently considered significant.

**2.** **RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE NOTES**

**_(a)_** **_Investors_**

Potential investors should be experienced with respect to transactions on capital markets and notes
and should understand the risks of transactions involving the Notes.


-----

Potential Investors should reach an investment decision only after careful consideration of the
information set forth in this Prospectus and general information relating to Notes.

Potential investors should ensure that they have sufficient financial resources to bear the risks of
purchase of the Notes.

Potential investors should have sufficient knowledge of the nature of Notes, the merits and risks of
investing in the relevant Notes and verify the suitability of such investment in light of their particular
financial situation.

Potential investors should make their own assessment of the legal, tax, accounting and regulatory
aspects of purchasing the Notes.

Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers on legal, tax and related aspects of investment
in the Notes.

Potential investors should be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser)
possible scenarios for economic and other factors that may affect their investment and their ability to
bear the applicable risks.

Some potential investors are subject to restricting investment regulations. These potential investors
should consult their legal counsel in order to determine whether investment in the Notes is authorised
by law, whether such investment is compatible with their other borrowings and whether other selling
restrictions are applicable to them.

**_(b)_** **_Risks related to the Notes generally_**

**The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity**

In the event that the Issuer would be obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of any Notes due to
any withholding as provided in Condition 7 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes - "Taxation" or
in the case of an event of default as provided in Condition 9 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes
"Events of Default", the Issuer may and, in certain circumstances shall, redeem all of the Notes then
outstanding at their then outstanding principal amount together with any interest accrued in
accordance with such Condition.

In addition, subject to the conditions set out in Condition 5(c) of the Terms and Conditions of the
Notes - "Make-whole redemption at the option of the Issuer", the Notes are redeemable in whole or in
part at the Issuer's option at any time at their relevant make-whole redemption amount.

Furthermore, the Issuer may at its option redeem all (but not some only) of the outstanding Notes at
their then outstanding principal amount together with any interest accrued during the period from, and
including, the date falling three (3) months before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity
Date, as provided in Condition 5(d) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes - "Residual Maturity
Call Option".

If 80 per cent. or more in initial nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding have been redeemed
pursuant to Condition 5(d) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes - "Residual Maturity Call
Option", the Issuer may, on not less than 30 or more than 60 calendar days' notice to the Noteholders
given within 30 calendar days after the Put Date, redeem, at its option, the remaining Notes as a whole
at the Put Amount.

As a consequence, investors may not be able to reinvest the moneys they receive upon such early
redemption in securities with the same yield as the redeemed Notes.


-----

**Credit Risk**

Holders of the Notes are exposed to the credit risk of the Issuer. Credit risk refers to the risk that the
Issuer may be unable to meet its financial obligations under the Notes. If the creditworthiness of the
Issuer deteriorates, the value of the Notes may decrease and holders of the Notes may loose all or part
of their investment.

**Change of Control - put option**

In the event of a Change of Control of the Issuer (as more fully described in Condition 8 of the Terms
and Conditions of the Notes “Change of Control”), each Noteholder will have the right to request the
Issuer to redeem or procure the purchase of all or part of its Notes at 101 per cent. of their then
outstanding principal amount together with any accrued interest. In such case, any trading market in
respect of those Notes in respect of which such redemption right is not exercised may become illiquid.
In addition, investors may not be able to reinvest the moneys they receive upon such early redemption
in securities with the same yield as the redeemed Notes.

**Restrictive covenants**

The Notes do not restrict the Issuer or its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined in the Terms and
Conditions of the Notes) from incurring additional debt. The Terms and Conditions of the Notes
contain a negative pledge that prohibits the Issuer in certain circumstances to create security over
assets, but only to the extent that such security is used to secure other notes or similar listed or quoted
debt instruments, and there are certain exceptions to the negative pledge. The Terms and Conditions
of the Notes do not contain any other covenants restricting the operations of the Issuer, or its ability to
distribute dividends or buy back shares. The Issuer’s subsidiaries are not bound by the obligations of
the Issuer under the Notes and are not guarantors of the Notes.

**Structural subordination due to holding company status**

The Issuer is a holding company. Investors will not have any direct claims on the cash flows or the
assets of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, and such subsidiaries have no obligation, contingent or otherwise,
to pay amounts due under the Notes or to make funds available to the Issuer for these payments.

Claims of the creditors of the Issuer’s subsidiaries have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries
over the claims of the Issuer’s creditors. Consequently, holders of the Notes are in effect structurally
subordinated on insolvency to the prior claims of the creditors of the Issuer’s subsidiaries.

**Modification of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes**

Holders of Notes will be grouped automatically for the defence of their common interests in a Masse,
as defined in Condition 11 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes - "Representation of the
Noteholders", and a general meeting of Noteholders can be held. The Terms and Conditions of the
Notes permit in certain cases defined majorities to bind all Noteholders including Noteholders who
did not attend and vote at the relevant general meeting and Noteholders who voted in a manner
contrary to the majority.

The general meeting of Noteholders may, subject to the provisions of Condition 11 of the Terms and
Conditions of the Notes - "Representation of the Noteholders", deliberate on any proposal relating to
the modification of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes, notably on any proposal, whether for
arbitration or settlement, relating to rights in controversy or which were subject of judicial decisions.


-----

**Change of law**

The Terms and Conditions of the Notes are based on French law in effect as at the date of this
Prospectus. No assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial or administrative
decision or change to French law or administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.

**French Insolvency Law**

Under French insolvency law, holders of debt securities are automatically grouped into a single
assembly of holders (the "Assembly") in order to defend their common interests if a safeguard
procedure (procédure de sauvegarde), an accelerated safeguard procedure (procédure de sauvegarde
_accélérée), an accelerated financial safeguard procedure (procédure de sauvegarde financière_
_accélérée) or a judicial reorganisation procedure (procédure de redressement judiciaire) is opened in_
France with respect to the Issuer.

The Assembly comprises holders of all debt securities issued by the Issuer (including the Notes),
whether or not under a debt issuance programme and regardless of their governing law.

The Assembly deliberates on the proposed safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde), the
proposed accelerated safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde accélérée), the proposed
accelerated financial safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde financière _accélérée) or the_
proposed judicial reorganisation plan (projet de plan de redressement) applicable to the Issuer and
may further agree to:

- increase the liabilities (charges) of holders of debt securities (including the Noteholders) by
rescheduling payments and/or partially or totally writing-off debts;
- establish an unequal treatment between holders of debt securities (including the Noteholders)
as appropriate under the circumstances; and/or
- decide to convert debt securities (including the Notes) into securities that give or may give
right to share capital.

Decisions of the Assembly will be taken by a two-third (2/3[rd]) majority (calculated as a proportion of
the debt securities held by the holders which have cast a vote at such Assembly; notwithstanding any
clause to the contrary and the law governing the debt securities). No quorum is required to hold the
Assembly.

For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions relating to the Representation of the Noteholders described
in the Terms and Conditions of the Notes set out in this Prospectus will not be applicable to the extent
they conflict with compulsory insolvency law provisions that apply in these circumstances.

**Taxation**

Potential purchasers and sellers of the Notes should be aware that they may be required to pay taxes
or other documentary charges or duties in accordance with the laws and practices of the country
where the Notes are transferred or other jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, no official statements of
the tax authorities or court decisions may be available for financial notes such as the Notes. Potential
investors are advised not to rely upon the tax summary contained in this Prospectus but to ask for their
own tax adviser's advice on their individual taxation with respect to the acquisition, sale and
redemption of the Notes. Only these advisors are in a position to duly consider the specific situation
of the potential investor. This investment consideration has to be read in connection with the taxation
sections of this Prospectus.


-----

**EU Savings Directive**

The EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of savings income in the form of
interest payments (the "Savings Directive") requires each Member State of the European Union (the
“Member State(s)”) to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of
interest and other similar income within the meaning of the Savings Directive made by a paying agent
within its jurisdiction to, or under certain circumstances collected for the benefit of a beneficial owner
(within the meaning of the Savings Directive), resident in that other Member State, except that Austria
imposes instead a withholding system for a transitional period unless the beneficiary of interest
payment elects for the exchange of information. The rate of this withholding tax is currently 35 per
cent.

Please refer to the section “Taxation – Savings Directive” of the taxation section of this Base
Prospectus for further details on the applicable withholding tax or reporting obligations under the
Savings Directive.

**The proposed financial transactions tax (EU FTT)**

The European Commission has published a proposal for a Directive for a common financial
transactions tax (the "EU FTT") in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria,
Portugal, Slovenia and Slovakia (the "Participating Member States").

The proposed EU FTT has very broad scope and could, if introduced in its current form, apply to
certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. The
issuance and subscription of Notes should, however, be exempt.

Under current proposals the EU FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the Participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes
where at least one party is a financial institution established in a Participating Member State, and at
least one party is established in a Participating Member State. A financial institution may be, or be
deemed to be, "established" in a Participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances,
including (a) by transacting with a person established in a Participating Member State or (b) where the
financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a Participating Member State.

On December 8, 2015, a joint statement was issued by the participating Member States (excluding
Estonia), indicating an intention to make decisions on the remaining open issues by the end of June
2016. Such implementation is to be progressive with an initial focus on the taxation of shares and
some derivatives.

The EU FTT could therefore apply, if implemented in its current draft form, to transactions involving
the transfer of Notes to persons located both within and outside the Participating Member States.
However, the EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between the Participating Member
States and the scope of such tax may be altered. It may therefore be altered prior to any
implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional Member States may decide to
participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the
EU FTT.

Whilst the Notes are held within Euroclear France, Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. and Clearstream
Banking, société anonyme (together, the “ICSDs”), in all but the most remote circumstances, it is not
expected that FATCA will affect the amount of any payment received by the ICSDs. However,
FATCA may affect payments made to custodians or intermediaries in the subsequent payment chain


-----

leading to the ultimate investor if any such custodian or intermediary generally is unable to receive
payments free of FATCA withholding. It also may affect payment to any ultimate investor that is a
financial institution that is not entitled to receive payments free of withholding under FATCA, or an
ultimate investor that fails to provide its broker (or other custodian or intermediary from which it
receives payment) with any information, forms, other documentation or consents that may be
necessary for the payments to be made free of FATCA withholding. Investors should choose the
custodians or intermediaries with care (to ensure each is compliant with FATCA or other laws or
agreements related to FATCA), provide each custodian or intermediary with any information, forms,
other documentation or consents that may be necessary for such custodian or intermediary to make a
payment free of FATCA withholding. Investors should consult their own tax adviser to obtain a more
detailed explanation of FATCA and how FATCA may affect them. The Issuer’s obligations under the
Notes are discharged once it has made payment to the ICSDs and the Issuer has therefore no
responsibility for any amount thereafter transmitted through the ICSDs and custodians or
intermediaries. Further, foreign financial institutions in a jurisdiction which has entered into an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States (an “IGA”) are generally not expected to be
required to withhold under FATCA or an IGA (or any law implementing an IGA) from payments they
make.

**_(c)_** **_Risks related to the market generally_**

**Market Value of the Notes**

The market value of the Notes will be affected by the creditworthiness of the Issuer and a number of
additional factors, including, but not limited to, market interest and yield rates and the time remaining
to the maturity date. The value of the Notes depends on a number of interrelated factors, including
economic, financial and political events in France or elsewhere, including factors affecting capital
markets generally and the stock exchanges on which the Notes are traded. The price at which a
Noteholder will be able to sell the Notes prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be
substantial, from the issue price or the purchase price paid by such Noteholder.

**An active trading market for the Notes may not develop (liquidity risk)**

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Notes will develop, or, if one does
develop, that it will be maintained. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop or is not
maintained, the market or trading price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. The
Issuer is entitled to buy the Notes for its own account or for the account of others, and to issue further
Notes. Such transactions may favourably or adversely affect the price development of the Notes. If
additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may adversely affect the value
of the Notes.

In addition, exercise of the Put Option, as defined and provided in Condition 8 in respect of any Notes
may affect the liquidity of the Notes in respect of which such put option is not exercised. Depending
on the number of Notes in respect of which the put option is exercised, any trading market in respect
of any outstanding Notes may become to varying degrees less liquid.

**Long-term securities**

The Notes will be redeemed on the Maturity Date. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the
Notes at any time before this date other than and as provided below for certain tax reasons (see
Condition 5 of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes - "Redemption and Purchase"). The
Noteholders have no right to call for their redemption except upon the occurrence of a Put Event as
provided in Condition 8 or upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as provided in Condition 9.
The Notes may, and in certain circumstances shall, be redeemed, in whole but not in part, at their
principal amount together with accrued interest in the event that certain French taxes are imposed as
provided in Condition 5.


-----

If 80 per cent. or more in initial nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding have been redeemed
pursuant to Condition 5(d) of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes - "Residual Maturity Call
Option", the Issuer may, on not less than 30 or more than 60 calendar days' notice to the Noteholders
given within 30 calendar days after the Put Date, redeem, at its option, the remaining Notes as a whole
at the Put Amount.

**Exchange rate risk**

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in euro. This presents certain risks relating to
currency conversions if an investor’s financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or
currency unit other than euro (the "Investor’s Currency"). These include the risk that exchange rates
may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of Euro or revaluation of the
Investor’s Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor’s Currency may
impose or modify exchange controls. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than
expected.

**Fixed Rate**

The Notes bearing interest at a fixed rate, investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent
changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**Rating**

The Notes have been assigned a rating of [BB-] by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. Nexans is
currently rated BB- (with outlook stable) by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services.

The rating may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional
factors discussed above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes.

As at the date of this Prospectus, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services is established in the European
Union, registered under the CRA Regulation and included in the list of registered credit rating
agencies published by the European Securities and Markets Authority on its website
(http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs) in accordance with the CRA
Regulation.

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be suspended, revised
or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time without notice.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES**

The issue outside the Republic of France of the €[] [] per cent. Notes due [] (the "Notes") by
Nexans (the "Issuer") has been authorised pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors
(Conseil d’administration) of the Issuer dated [12] May 2016 and a decision of its Chief Executive
Officer dated [] [May] 2016. The Notes are issued with the benefit of an agency agreement dated

[] May 2016 (the "Agency Agreement") between the Issuer, Société Générale as fiscal agent and
principal paying agent (the "Fiscal Agent", which expression shall, where the context so admits,
include any successor for the time being as Fiscal Agent), as calculation agent (the “Calculation
**Agent”, which expression shall, where the context so admits, include any successor for the time being**
as Calculation Agent) and as put agent (the "Put Agent", which expression shall, where the context so
admits, include any successor for the time being as Put Agent). Copies of the Agency Agreement are
available for inspection during normal business hours at the specified offices of the Paying Agents.
References below to "Conditions" are, unless the context otherwise requires, to the numbered
paragraphs below. In these Conditions, "holder of Notes", "holder of any Note" or "Noteholder"
means the person whose name appears in the account of the relevant Account Holder as being entitled
to such Notes.

**1.** **Form, Denomination and Title**

The Notes are issued in dematerialised bearer form (au porteur) in the denomination of €100,000
each. Title to the Notes will be evidenced in accordance with Article L.211-3 et seq. of the French
_Code monétaire et financier by book entries (inscription en compte). No physical document of title_
(including _certificats_ _représentatifs pursuant to Article R.211-7 of the French_ _Code monétaire et_
_financier) will be issued in respect of the Notes._

The Notes will, upon issue, be inscribed in the books of Euroclear France, which shall credit the
accounts of the Account Holders. For the purpose of these Conditions, "Account Holders" shall mean
any authorised financial intermediary institution entitled to hold, directly or indirectly, accounts on
behalf of its customers with Euroclear France, and includes Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. ("Euroclear")
and the depositary bank for Clearstream Banking, société anonyme ("Clearstream, Luxembourg").

Title to the Notes shall be evidenced by entries in the books of Account Holders and will pass upon,
and transfer of Notes may only be effected through, registration of the transfer in such books, and
only in the denomination of €100,000.

**2.** **Status**

The principal and interest in respect of the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank and will at all times rank _pari passu without any_
preference among themselves and (subject to such exceptions as are from time to time mandatory
under French law) equally and rateably with any other present or future unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of the Issuer.

**3.** **Negative Pledge**

The Issuer undertakes, until all the Notes have been redeemed, not to grant any mortgage
(hypothèque) over its present or future real property assets or interests, nor any pledge (nantissement),
charge (gage), or any other security interest (sûreté réelle) on its present or future assets or incomes, to
holders of other notes (obligations) issued or guaranteed by the Issuer, which are, or are capable of
being, admitted to trading on a regulated market, unless at the same time the Notes are equally and
rateably secured therewith.

Such undertaking is given only in relation to security interests given for the benefit of holders of notes
(obligations) which are, or are capable of being, admitted to trading on a regulated market and does


-----

not affect in any way the right of the Issuer to dispose of its assets or to grant any security in respect
of such assets in any other circumstance.

**4.** **Interest**

**_(a)_** **_Interest Payment Dates_**

The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from time to time from, and including,

[May]2016 (the “Issue Date”) to but excluding [] (the “Maturity Date”) at the rate of [] per
cent. per annum payable annually in arrear on [] in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date")
commencing on [●]. **[There will be a first [short/long] coupon in respect of the first payment of**
interest on [●] for the period from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, [].] The amount
of interest payable on each Note in the event there has been no partial redemption of the Notes
pursuant to Condition 5(c) below, will be [€[●] in respect of the first Interest Payment Date and] €[●]
in respect of each Interest Payment Date [thereafter], subject to adjustment in the event of a reduction
of the principal amount of the Notes pursuant to Condition 5(c).

**_(b)_** **_Interest Payments_**

Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption, unless payment of principal is
improperly withheld or refused on such date. In such event, interest on the outstanding principal
amount of such Note from time to time shall continue to accrue at such rate until, and including,
whichever is the earlier of (i) the day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are
received by or on behalf of the relevant holder and (ii) the day of receipt by or on behalf of Euroclear
France of all sums due in respect of all the Notes.

Interest shall be calculated on an Actual/Actual - ICMA basis, as follows:

(i) if the Accrual Period is equal to or shorter than the Determination Period during
which it falls, the Actual/Actual-ICMA basis will be the number of days in the
Accrual Period divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such
Determination Period and (y) the number of Determination Periods normally ending
in any year; and

(ii) if the Accrual Period is longer than one Determination Period, the Actual/ActualICMA basis will be the sum of:

(a) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the Determination
Period in which it begins divided by the product of (1) the number of days in
such Determination Period and (2) the number of Determination Periods
normally ending in any year; and

(b) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the next Determination
Period divided by the product of (1) the number of days in such
Determination Period and (2) the number of Determination Periods normally
ending in any year

where

"Accrual Period" means the relevant period for which interest is to be calculated (from and
including the first such day to but excluding the last); and

"Determination Period" means the period from, and including, the Issue Date to, but
excluding, the first Interest Payment Date and each successive period from, and including, an
Interest Payment Date to, but excluding, the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.


-----

**5.** **Redemption and Purchase**

The Notes may not be redeemed otherwise than in accordance with this Condition and with
Conditions 8 and 9.

**_(a)_** **_Final Redemption_**

Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as provided below, the Notes will be
redeemed by the Issuer at their outstanding principal amount on the Maturity Date.

**_(b)_** **_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_**

(i) If, by reason of a change in any law or regulation of the Republic of France or any political
subdivision or authority therein or thereof having power to tax, or any change in the official
application or interpretation of such law or regulation (including a holding by a competent
court), becoming effective after the Issue Date, the Issuer would, on the occasion of the next
payment of principal or interest due in respect of the Notes, not be able to make such payment
without having to pay additional amounts as specified in Condition 7, the Issuer may, at its
sole discretion, at any time, subject to having given not more than 60 nor less than 30
calendar days' prior notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (which notice
shall be irrevocable), redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes outstanding at their
outstanding principal amount, together with all interest accrued to the date fixed for
redemption, provided that the due date for redemption of which notice hereunder may be
given shall be no earlier than the latest practicable date on which the Issuer could make
payment of principal or interest without withholding for French taxes.

(ii) If the Issuer would on the next payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes be
prevented by French law from making payment to the Noteholders of the full amount then
due and payable, notwithstanding the undertaking to pay additional amounts contained in
Condition 7, then the Issuer shall forthwith give notice of such fact to the Fiscal Agent and
the Issuer shall, subject to having given not less than seven calendar days' prior notice to the
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (which notice shall be irrevocable), redeem all,
but not some only, of the Notes at their outstanding principal amount, together with all
interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption of which notice hereunder may be given,
provided that the due date for redemption shall be no earlier than the latest practicable date on
which the Issuer could make payment of the full amount of principal or interest payable in
respect of the Notes or, if such date has passed, as soon as practicable thereafter.

**_(c)_** **_Make-whole redemption at the option of the Issuer_**

The Issuer may, subject to compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and directives and to having
given not more than 30 nor less than 15 calendar days' notice to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 12 (which notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption (a
"Make-whole Redemption Date")), on one or more occasions redeem all, or a specified percentage
(the “Specified Percentage”) (which Specified Percentage shall be specified in such notice) of the
principal amount of each of the Notes, at any time prior to the Maturity Date at an amount per Note
(rounded to the nearest cent with 0.005 cents being rounded upwards) calculated by the Calculation
Agent and equal to the greater of:

(a) 100 per cent. of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes or, as the case may be, the
relevant Specified Percentage; or

(b) the sum of the then current values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and
interest relating to then outstanding principal amount of the Notes or, as the case may be, the
relevant Specified Percentage (not including any interest accrued on such outstanding


-----

principal amount of the Notes or, as the case may be, Specified Percentage, from, and
including, the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date or, as the case may be, the Issue
Date to, but excluding, the relevant Make-whole Redemption Date) discounted to such Makewhole Redemption Date on an annual basis (based on the actual number of days elapsed
divided by 365 or (in the case of a leap year) by 366) at the Reference Rate (as defined below)
plus [●] per cent.,

plus, in each case (a) or (b) above, any interest accrued on such outstanding principal amount of the
Notes or, as the case may be, Specified Percentage from, and including, the immediately preceding
Interest Payment Date or, as the case may be, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the relevant Makewhole Redemption Date.

The Reference Rate will be published by the Issuer in accordance with Condition 12 as soon as
possible prior to, and in any case not later than the second Business Day prior to the relevant Makewhole Redemption Date.

The Reference Rate is the average of the four quotations given by the Reference Dealers of the midmarket annual yield of the Reference Bund on the fourth Business Day (as defined in below)
preceding the Make-whole Redemption Date at 11.00 a.m. (Central European Time ("CET")).

If the Reference Bund is no longer outstanding, a Similar Security will be chosen by the Calculation
Agent at 11.00 a.m. (CET) on the third Business Day preceding the Make-whole Redemption Date,
quoted in writing by the Calculation Agent.

Where:

"Business Day" has the meaning given to it in Condition 6(b) below;

"Reference Bund" means [●];

"Reference Dealers" means each of the four banks selected by the Calculation Agent which are
primary European government security dealers, and their respective successors, or market makers in
pricing corporate bond issues;

"Similar Security" means a reference bond or reference bonds issued by the German Federal
Government having an actual or interpolated maturity comparable with the remaining term of the
Notes that would be utilised, at the time of selection and in accordance with customary financial
practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity to the remaining
term of the Notes.

All notifications, opinions, determinations, certifications, calculations, quotations and decisions given,
expressed, made or obtained for the purposes of this Condition 5(c) by the Calculation Agent shall (in
the absence of wilful default, bad faith or manifest error) be binding on the Issuer and the Noteholders
and (in the absence as aforesaid) no liability to the Issuer or the Noteholders shall attach to the
Calculation Agent in connection with the exercise or non-exercise of its powers, duties and
discretions.

**_(d)_** **_Residual maturity call at the option of the Issuer_**

The Issuer may, subject to compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and directives, (i) on giving
not less than 15 nor more than 30 calendar days' irrevocable notice in accordance with Condition 12
to the Noteholders redeem, at any time as on any date during the period from, and including, the date
falling three (3) months before the Maturity Date to, but excluding, the Maturity Date, the Notes, in
whole (but not in part), at their outstanding principal amount together with interest accrued to, but
excluding, the date fixed for redemption or (ii) if 80 per cent. or more in initial nominal amount of the


-----

Notes then outstanding have been redeemed pursuant to the Condition 8, the Issuer may, on not less
than 30 nor more than 60 calendar days' notice to the Noteholders given within 30 calendar days after
the Put Date, redeem, at its option, the remaining Notes in whole at the Put Amount.

**_(e)_** **_Purchase_**

The Issuer may at any time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise at any price. Notes so
purchased by the Issuer may be held and resold in accordance with Articles L.213-1-A and D.213-1-A
of the French Code monétaire et financier in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

**_(f)_** **_Cancellation_**

will have the option (the “Put Option”) (unless, prior to the giving of the Put Event Notice (as
defined below), the Issuer gives notice of its intention to redeem the Notes under Conditions 5(b), 5(c)

redeem or, at the Issuer's option, to procure the purchase of that Note on the Optional Redemption
Date (as defined below) at the Put Amount (as defined below).

A "Put Event" shall be deemed to have occurred at each time (i) a Change of Control occurs and (ii)
within the Change of Control Period a Rating Downgrade occurs in respect of that Change of Control
or, as the case may be, potential Change of Control.

A "Change of Control" in respect of the Issuer shall be deemed to have occurred at each time
(whether or not approved by the Issuer) that any Relevant Person(s), at any time following the Issue
Date of the Notes, acquire(s) Control of the Issuer unless such Relevant Person(s) is (are) under the
Control of Nexans immediately prior to such Change of Control.

cent. of the voting rights exercisable in ordinary or extraordinary shareholders’
general meetings of the Issuer where no other shareholder of such entity, directly or

percentage of the voting rights exercisable in such general meetings which is higher
than the percentage of voting rights attached to the number of shares held by such
Relevant Person.

"Put Amount" means in respect of any Note an amount equal to 101 per cent. of its then outstanding
principal amount together with (or, where purchased, together with an amount equal to) accrued

(i) within the Change of Control Period:

(a) any investment grade credit rating (Baa3/BBB-, or equivalent, or better) assigned to
the Notes by any Rating Agency is (x) either downgraded to a non-investment grade
credit rating (Ba1/BB+, or equivalent, or worse) or withdrawn and (y) is not within
the Change of Control Period subsequently (in the case of a downgrade) upgraded or
(in the case of a withdrawal) reinstated to an investment grade credit rating by such
Rating Agency; or

(b) any non-investment grade credit rating (Ba1/BB+, or equivalent, or worse) assigned
to the Notes by any Rating Agency is (x) downgraded by one or more notches (for


-----

illustration, Ba1/BB+ to Ba2/BB being one notch) or withdrawn and (y) is not within
the Change of Control Period subsequently (in the case of a downgrade) upgraded or
(in the case of a withdrawal) reinstated to its earlier credit rating or better by such
Rating Agency; or

Control Period an investment grade credit rating to the Notes,

provided that if on the Relevant Announcement Date the Notes carry a credit rating from
more than one Rating Agency, at least one of which is investment grade, then sub-paragraph
(a) will apply; and

(ii) in making the relevant decision(s) referred to (a) and (b) above, the relevant Rating Agency
announces publicly or confirms in writing to the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent or the holder of any
Note, that such decision(s) resulted directly, in whole or to a significant degree, from the
occurrence of the Change of Control or, as the case may be, potential Change of Control,

_provided that if the rating designations employed by any Rating Agency are changed from those in_
force at the time of the Issue Date, the Issuer shall determine the rating designations of such Rating
Agency as are most equivalent to the prior rating designations of such Rating Agency and this
Condition 8 shall (in the absence of manifest error) be read accordingly.

Issuer, any actual or potential bidder or any advisor thereto relating to any potential Change of
Control where within 180 calendar days following the date of such announcement or statement, a
Change of Control occurs.

Immediately upon the Issuer becoming aware that a Put Event has occurred, the Issuer shall, give
notice (a "Put Event Notice") to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 specifying the
nature of the Put Event and the procedure for exercising the Put Option contained in this Condition 8.

To exercise the Put Option to require the redemption or, as the case may be, purchase of a Note under
this Condition 8, the holder of that Note must transfer or cause to be transferred by its Account Holder
its Notes to be so redeemed or purchased to the account of the Put Agent specified in the Put Event
Notice for the account of the Issuer (or any relevant purchaser) within the period of 120 calendar days
after the Put Event Notice is given (the "Put Period"), together with a duly signed and completed

Optional Redemption Date via the relevant Account Holder.

**9.** **Events of Default**

The Representative (as defined in Condition 11 below), acting on behalf of the Masse (as defined in

payment of any other financial indebtedness or guarantee of financial indebtedness in
a total amount at least equal to €40 million on its due date or, as the case may be, at

good faith before a competent tribunal, in which case an early redemption of the
Notes will be mandatory only if the tribunal has found against the Issuer and the
Issuer has not complied with the judgement in accordance with its terms; or

    - if any other financial indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries (as
defined below) in an amount in excess of €40 million is declared due and payable due
to an event of default under one of the agreements relating to such indebtedness of the
Issuer or such Principal Subsidiary, unless the Issuer challenges such default in good
faith before a competent tribunal, in which case an early redemption of the Notes will
be mandatory only if the tribunal has found against the Issuer and the Issuer has not
complied with the judgement in accordance with its terms; or

    - in the case where the Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined below) has

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**3 May 2016 Presse release**

2016 First-Quarter Financial Information

  - _Organic sales down by 1.5%.[1]_

  - _Ongoing robust growth in the first quarter for automotive harnesses and LAN cables &_

_systems, offsetting the continued deterioration in the oil and mining sectors._

  - _Sales for the submarine high-voltage business down 14% as expected, due to the effect of_

_project timings._

  - _Start of a recovery in sales of medium- and low-voltage distribution cables to European_

_energy operators._

  - _Satisfactory progress for all of the Group's strategic initiatives._

Today, Nexans announced that its sales for the first quarter of 2016 amounted to 1,433 million euros
(versus 1,601 million euros for first-quarter 2015). At constant metal prices[2] the sales figure came to
1,104 million euros, representing an organic decrease of 1.5% year on year but 2.4% organic growth
compared with the fourth quarter of 2015.

The year-on-year organic growth figure – which is in line with the Group’s expectations – is mainly
due to the anticipated effect of project timings in the submarine high-voltage business. Invoiced sales
for this business were 14% lower than in the first quarter of 2015 but up 13% on the fourth quarter of
2015.

The general trends seen in late 2015 continued into the first three months of 2016, with ongoing
mixed pictures across the various businesses:

  - In high added-value businesses (automotive harnesses, LAN cables and systems), sales

remained strong despite an unfavorable basis of comparison which resulted in weaker yearon-year organic growth rates than in 2015. For the submarine high-voltage business, the first
quarter of 2016 was a pivotal moment between the end of existing contracts and the start-up
of new contracts won in 2015.

  - For businesses that were already in a negative growth phase in 2015 sales were once again

very low, with Australia and the oil & gas sectors experiencing further reductions in business
volumes. In Brazil, however, despite the country's persistent economic difficulties, the Group
felt the positive impacts of new financed overhead power line contracts, which drove sharp
sales growth of 32% compared with first-quarter 2015 and 13% versus fourth-quarter 2015.

  - The Group's other cable businesses continued to gradually recover in Europe and North

America, and reported brisk momentum in the Middle East, Russia and Africa Area.

1 The first-quarter 2015 sales figure used for like-for-like comparisons corresponds to sales at constant
non-ferrous metal prices adjusted for the effects of exchange rates and changes in the scope of
consolidation. The currency effect on sales at constant non-ferrous metal prices for the first quarter of
2016 amounted to a negative 40 million euros and changes in the scope of consolidation had a negative
10 million euro impact.

2 To neutralize the effect of fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices and therefore measure the
underlying sales trend, Nexans also calculates its sales using a constant price for copper and aluminum.


-----

**Commenting on the Group's performance for the first quarter of 2016, Arnaud Poupart-**
**Lafarge, Nexans' Chief Executive Officer, said:**

"The Group's performance for the first quarter of 2016 does not reflect any surprises in terms of
_trends and developments in our sales or markets._

_As we are still operating in the same lackluster market environment as in 2015, our key aim now is to_
_deliver the expected results of our strategic initiatives, particularly in relation to their three main_
_objectives: reducing fixed and variable costs and optimizing margins._

_We are therefore confident that by continuing to implement our current action plan, the operating_
_margin as a percentage of sales should considerably be pushed up, even if sales volumes do not_
_increase."_

**Distributors & Installers**

The Distributors & Installers division posted sales of 279 million euros for the first quarter of 2016.
This figure represented a slight organic decrease of 0.6% on the comparable prior-year period,
following on from the 2.7% year-on-year contraction recorded for 2015.
Sales of LAN cables and systems (which represent around one-quarter of the division's business)
continued the steady increase begun five quarters ago. At end-March 2016, this upward trend had
reached all geographic areas, especially the United States, Europe and China, where demand for data
center projects is still high.
Sales of low-voltage power cables retreated 3.4% year on year on an organic basis, but remained
stable compared with the fourth quarter of 2015 (down 0.9%).
In Europe, the division pursued its measures to selectively streamline its portfolio against a backdrop
of stable sales in the Group's main markets since the fourth quarter of 2015.
Markets remained flat in North America, Brazil and Australia, but were buoyant in the rest of South
America and in the Middle East, Russia and Africa.
In all of the Distributors & Installers division’s geographic areas, sales teams are being mobilized and
measures implemented to optimize the customer/product portfolio with a view to offering customers
higher value-added solutions.

**Industry**

Sales for the Industry division amounted to 301 million euros in the first quarter of 2016, down 5.2%
year on year on an organic basis but up 2.2% on the fourth quarter of 2015.

The automotive harnesses segment continued to perform well, although at 3% its year-on-year growth
rate slowed by base effect.

Sales for the wind farm and aeronautical segments also continued to trend upwards thanks to an order
book that is still very solid.

Conversely, business volumes contracted in the division's other segments. In particular, the persistent
marked decline in the price of crude oil that began in the second half of 2015 resulted in a sharp drop
in sales of cables for the oil industry. Consequently, the Group’s US subsidiary, AmerCable, reported
an organic year-on-year decrease of around 30% in first-quarter 2016 although sales for the period
were stable compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The oil price crunch, which continued to
impact the oil & gas sector's entire value chain (notably exploration), also drove down business for
Asian shipyards involved in cabling oil platforms. This situation weighed heavily on the Group's sales
in this sector in China and South Korea.
Against this backdrop of negative growth for the division, the Group is pursuing its policy of reducing
fixed costs, optimizing margins and moving towards a more favorable product mix in order to
improve its margins.

**Transmission, Distribution & Operators**

Sales generated by the Transmission, Distribution & Operators division came to 449 million euros in
the first quarter of 2016, representing an organic decrease of 1.6% compared with the same period of
2015 but a 1.2% organic increase versus the fourth quarter of 2015.

_Distribution_

Sales of distribution cables rose by 6.5% on an organic basis in the first three months of 2016, with
higher business volumes in all geographic areas apart from the Asia-Pacific Area.

In Europe year-on-year growth came to 5.2%, in line with the gradual improvement seen in late 2015
and reflecting the slightly better trends in the Group’s main domestic markets in the area. The Group
continued to apply a selective commercial approach in the first quarter of 2016 and lower aluminum
premiums had a positive effect on costs during the period.

Sales in the Middle East, Russia and Africa Area jumped 41%, primarily led by (i) the Lebanese
market, which only began to pick up towards the end of the second quarter of 2015, (ii) particularly
high demand for cables for transformers in Morocco during first-quarter 2016, and (iii) successful
measures taken in Russia to streamline the customer/product portfolio.

Sales in South America were also up significantly (by 29.5%), reflecting the completion of a largescale overhead power line project in Brazil for which pre-financing was obtained in late 2015.

In North America, sales held firm but nonetheless remained at a low level.

Sales declined once again in the Asia-Pacific Area, driven down by the difficult operating contexts in
both Australia and China. In Australia, the Distribution segment’s sales fell at a faster pace than in
2015 as it continued to suffer from the weak capital expenditure levels of local energy operators, and
in China, the Group decided to adopt a more restrictive credit policy, which resulted in a reduction in
volumes.

_Operators_

Sales to telecommunications operators are mainly generated in Europe. In first-quarter 2016, the
Operators segment reported a 2.2% year-on-year decrease in this area, reflecting a slow start-up of


-----

business at the beginning of the year in countries where the Group still has a copper cable offering for
telecommunications networks (Sweden, Norway and Switzerland).

Conversely, the production of optical fiber cables rose sharply and sales of connection accessories for
telecommunications networks also increased.

_Land high-voltage cables_

The land high-voltage business delivered slight year-on-year growth in first-quarter 2016, with sales
up 3.2%. Its order book was strengthened during the period, which is expected to lead to an increase
in volumes as from the second quarter. The North American plant in Charleston is still under capacity
but its workload rose during the first three months of 2016.

_Submarine high-voltage cables_

Sales of submarine high-voltage cables were 14.1% lower than in first-quarter 2015.

This figure reflects the fact that NSN and Nordlink – the two major contracts won by the Group in
2015 – had not yet entered the production phase in first-quarter 2016. In addition, there were no major
installation phases for the business's other contracts during the period, unlike in the first quarter of
2015 when there was a significant amount of installation work for projects such as the ItalyMontenegro, Malta-Sicily, and Mallorca-Ibiza power links. Consequently, maintenance was carried
out on the Group's cable-laying ship (Skagerrak) during first-quarter 2016, immobilizing it for part of
the period.

Despite the slowdown in capital spending in the oil & gas sectors, which negatively affected the order
book, invoicing levels for umbilical cables remained strong in the first three months of 2016 (relating
to new contracts won in 2015).

**Other Activities**

The "Other Activities" segment – which essentially corresponds to external sales of copper wires –
reported sales of 76 million euros, up 11.8% on the first quarter of 2015. All of the segment's
geographic areas contributed to this increase.

**Additional Information**

During the three months ended March 31, 2016 the Group continued its program to selectively
streamline its operations portfolio and as a result has decided to close, in the near future, its plant
specialized in the production of wires and cables for the US defense sector.

Lastly, the plan announced in June 2015 to reduce the Group’s support functions and decrease
capacity for medium-voltage cables in Europe has now been launched and the related measures are
being implemented as expected.

Nexans is a partner in the "ENSURE" project for the development of sustainable grid solutions

_The ENSURE project, funded by the German BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)_
_will see a consortium of 21 companies and institutions working on reducing grid conversion costs_
_through a combination of locally and centrally produced electricity_

Earlier this month in Berlin, the Federal Minister of Education and Research Johanna Wanka
announced the projects selected as "Copernicus projects for the energy turnaround". These projects,
funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, will develop technological and economic
solutions for the conversion of the energy system. "By 2025, we will be providing new energy
_concepts that can be used on a large technical scale – and which will also be socially beneficial", said_
Wanka. Out of all the applicants, the ENSURE consortium, whose project partners include Nexans,
delivered the most convincing proposal for the development of new grid structures.

Alongside the consortium leader, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and the management
committee members RWTH Aachen, the energy supplier E.ON, grid operator TenneT TSO GmbH
and the technology groups Siemens AG and ABB, Nexans, together with the Leibniz University of
Hanover, qualified as a project partner for TenneT. A total of 21 partners from the fields of education,
research and industry are participating in ENSURE.

The aim of the ENSURE project is to develop and test an effective energy grid structure that uses an
efficient combination of locally and centrally produced electricity. The project will also consider
economic, technical and social aspects. It plans to show how energy from fluctuating renewable
sources can be locally integrated into the grid and that reliable interaction with the transmission grid
can be guaranteed. Nexans will focus particularly on increasing the reliability of long-distance energy
transmission systems, especially in the face of external disruptions.

The ENSURE project is planned in three phases. Initially, the basic principles will be researched;
work on the research project will begin this year. There will then be a pilot, and in the final phase up
to 2025, a large-scale demonstrator will show how new urban systems can be efficiently connected to
the transmission grid.

According to Volker Gauler, Product Manager of the Land High Voltage group at Nexans, "TenneT's
_selection of Nexans as an industry project partner is evidence of our good relationship and their high_
_level of trust in our research and development expertise. We are delighted to be contributing our_
_expertise to the ENSURE project's development and testing of ground-breaking transmission grids"._

Nexans Cables to bring Internet to Amazon Rainforest

_Nexans Norway is supplying fibre optic cables to the Connected Amazonia Program in Brazil to_
_connect 4 million people to the Internet_

Brazil’s Connected Amazonia Program will include Nexans submarine fibre optic cables. The project
aims to bring Internet to 4 million people in the Amazon Rainforest. The project comprises 7,700 km
of cables to connect 52 municipal areas through five separate cable routes on and beneath riverbeds
because of the unique environment in the Amazon.

For Brazil’s Connected Amazonia Program, one of largest submarine fibre projects in the world, the
275 km of Nexans cables will be installed in riverbeds between Coari and Tefé. The entire network
will be made up of five data highways: Upper Negro river, Upper Solimões, Madeira, Purus and
Juruá.

For this project, Nexans recommended using high performance cables that have a minimal
environmental impact. This allows the project to serve the needs of local communities while
preserving the fragile Amazon Rainforest ecosystem. Nexans supplied cables that will not release
harmful substances into the delicate river ecosystem and therefore have no negative impact on the
environment. The fibre optic cables from Nexans’ URC-1 family of cables meet all international
standards for submarine cables.

To handle the strong currents in the river that occur throughout the year, a flat-bottomed barge will be
used as the cable-laying vessel. For additional security, five support vessels will accompany the cablelaying barge. In the future, local teams with specialist tools can maintain the cables.

The Connected Amazonia Program aims to bring a high quality Internet connection to the State of
Amazonas, not only to connect residents to the Internet, but also to enable telemedicine, distance
learning and greater interconnection between health, security and traffic services. The Program aims
to do this while minimising the environment impact of the installation.

Brazil is ranked fourth in the world for the number of users accessing the Internet and this will only
grow with this project, which connects native and riverside communities in the Amazon to the
Internet. In order to provide a premium service, the cables were manufactured at Nexans Norway, a
specialist plant focussing on high performance Ethernet solutions, and shipped to Brazil for
installation.

Ragnar Vogt, Director at Nexans Norway said, “This project will do more than connect native people
_to the Internet. It will bring investment, improved healthcare and better access to education to_
_traditionally isolated regions. We are proud to be helping to bring technology to the Amazon_
_Rainforest. Nexans is looking forward to the challenge of working in such a unique environment. To_
_ensure the Program got all the expertise we could offer, the Norwegian and Brazilian teams worked_
_together to combine technological and local area knowledge.”_

G2 Mobility Nexans bpifrance innovacom

_Nexans and G2mobility sign a strategic partnership for EV charging solutions. The agreement is_
_backed by a €2.7 million round of funding from Nexans and its established shareholders, Bpifrance_
_and Innovacom._

G2mobility, a French leader in smart charging solutions for electric vehicles (EV), has signed an
industrial and commercial partnership with the Nexans Group, a global leader in cables and cabling
solutions, to accelerate the deployment of EV charging infrastructure in France and around the world.
The agreement is backed by a €2.7 million round of funding from Nexans and its established
shareholders, Bpifrance and Innovacom.


-----

Based on the current trend, there will be
nearly three million electric vehicles on roads
around the world by 2018, compared with
500,000 units in 2014, according to a forecast
by market analyst Frost & Sullivan.
The market is also flourishing in France,
where EV ownership tripled between 2012
and 2015 (see graph). A growing number of
new models on the market should further
accelerate this growth among private users.
Against this backdrop, there is huge global
demand for smart charging infrastructure.
Nexans and G2mobility already offer
comprehensive solutions to match these new
mobility trends, as well as a means to
overcome challenges in energy management
for related infrastructure.

In addition to investment, the partnership takes into account industrial and commercial considerations.
It combines the versatility of G2mobility—a start-up specializing in IT technology for charging
stations—with the resources of Nexans—a key player in cable and cabling solutions that has
commercial and logistics expertise in the global market.
The partnership provides a unique value chain that incorporates connection infrastructure, charging
stations, energy management and monitoring systems to facilitate the deployment of EV charging
infrastructure. As part of the deal, the G2mobility range of charging stations will be made at the
Nexans site in Donchery, in France's Ardennes region, starting in June 2016.
**Pierre Clasquin, CEO of G2mobility: "We are in a fast-growing sector and the e-mobility market is**
_booming. Our future success in building on what we have already accomplished requires global reach_
_and significant industrial resources. Working with a global leader like Nexans will allow us to_
_accelerate this process to reach the next phase.”_
**Thierry Costerg, General Manager at Nexans Network Solutions N.V.: "The synergy between our**
_respective areas of expertise—Nexans in the global cable market and G2mobility in smart charging—_
_makes our collaboration particularly well-suited. Through this partnership, Nexans and G2mobility_
_will aim to establish a position at the forefront of the growing market for charging stations and help_
_to promote EV deployment around the world.”_
**Mathieu Rouget, Investment Director, Bpifrance: "This is a key step for G2mobility: a start-up**
_which has, in barely four years, successfully positioned solutions that now handle more than 6,000_
_charging stations in the French market alone. This symbolic partnership between a small start-up and_
_a major corporation, backed by new funding will allow G2mobility to satisfy even more customers in_
_a booming market. The investment represents Bpifrance's commitment to support the energy and_
_environmental transition."_
**Jérôme Faul, Managing Partner at Innovacom: "Synergy between start-ups and established**
_manufacturers is vital to turn a fruitful beginning into a lasting success. With its charging stations,_
_connection technology, energy management capabilities and cloud-based solutions to manage and_
_operate infrastructure, G2mobility will be in a position to offer a comprehensive response to market_
_challenges in France and around the world. The involvement of Nexans confirms our initial_
_assessment of G2mobility's ability to make the smart charging revolution a reality."_
As part of this round of funding, G2mobility has received the support of investment banking firm
Philippe Hottinguer Finance (Philippe Hottinguer, Aubert Vernier) and law firm Joffe & Associés
(Thomas Saltiel, Charlotte Viandaz).

Nexans to close its cable factory dedicated to Defense Market in the US

_Elm City factory in North Carolina will cease production on June 30 2016_

Nexans has announced that its US Subsidiary based in Elm City, North Carolina has decided to close
its cable factory focused on the production of defense wires and cables. The decision has been taken
in response to both a lack of profitability for the factory combined with the generally unfavourable
mid to long term prospects for the defense cable market in the region.

Employees at the Elm City factory have been notified of the closure and production will cease on June
30 2016.

The Nexans Group will continue to service the aerospace and defense cable markets, from the
Group’s existing factories in other locations.

**TAXATION**

_The following is a summary limited to certain tax considerations in France and, as the case may be,_
_the European Union relating to the Notes as of the date of this prospectus, subject to any changes in_
_law or in interpretations, and is included herein solely for information purposes. It does not purport_
_to be a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations which may be relevant to a decision to_
_purchase, own or dispose of the Notes. Each prospective holder or beneficial owner of Notes should_
_consult its tax advisor as to the tax consequences of any investment in or ownership and disposition of_
_the Notes._

**Savings directive**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income (the "Savings
**Directive"), each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State,**
inter alia, details of payments of interest or other similar income, within the meaning of the Savings
Directive, paid by a paying agent within its jurisdiction to, or under certain circumstances collected to
the benefit of, a beneficial owner (within the meaning of the Savings Directive) resident in that other
Member State; however, for a transitional period, Austria may instead apply a withholding system in
relation to such payments. The rate of this withholding tax is currently 35%. The transitional period is
to terminate at the end of the first full fiscal year following agreement by certain non-EU countries to
the exchange of information relating to such payments.

Also with effect from 1 July 2005, a number of non-EU countries, and certain dependent or associated
territories of certain Member States, have agreed to adopt similar measures (either provision of
information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a paying agent within its
jurisdiction to, or under certain circumstances collected to the benefit of, a beneficial owner (within
the meaning of the Savings Directive) resident in a Member State. In addition, the Member States
have entered into reciprocal provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with
certain of those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a paying agent in a
Member State to, or under certain circumstances collected to the benefit of, a beneficial owner (within
the meaning of the Savings Directive) resident in one of those territories.

On 9 December 2014, the Council adopted Directive 2014/107/UE which amended Directive
2011/16/EU to extend the mandatory automatic exchange of information to a wider range of income
in accordance with the Global Standard released by the OECD Council in July 2014 and ensured a
coherent, consistent and comprehensive Union-wide approach to the automatic exchange of financial
account information in the internal market. This Directive 2014/107/UE prevails on the provisions set
forth in the previous Directives on savings.

To ensure the seamless continuation of automatic reporting of financial account information, the
Directive 2015/2060 dated 10 November 2015 provides the repeal of Directive 2003/48/EC with
effect on 1 January 2016 subject to the following transitional arrangements:

(i) Without prejudice to the provisions set forth in paragraph (ii), the following obligations of

**_Investors who are in any doubt as to their position should consult their professional advisors._**

**France**

_The following specifically contains information on withholding taxes levied on the income from the_
_Notes held by Noteholders (i) who are not tax residents in France (other than individuals), (ii) who do_
_not hold their Notes through a fixed base or a permanent establishment in France and (iii) who do not_
_otherwise hold shares of the Issuer or are not otherwise affiliated with the Issuer within the meaning_
_or Article 39-12 of the French Code Général des Impôts._

The Savings Directive has been implemented in French law under Article 242 ter of the French Code
général des impôts and Articles 49 I ter to 49 I sexies of Annex 3 to the French Code général des
impôts, which imposes on paying agents based in France an obligation to report to the French tax
authorities certain information with respect to interest payments made to beneficial owners domiciled
in another Member State, including, among other things, the identity and address of the beneficial
owner and certain detailed information on the different categories of interest paid to that beneficial
owner.

Payments of interest and other securities income made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes will not
be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French _Code général des_
_impôts unless such payments are made outside France in a non-cooperative State or territory (Etat ou_
_territoire non coopératif) within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the French_ _Code général des_
_impôts (a "Non-Cooperative State") (notably made to a bank account opened in a financial_
institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State), in which case a 75% withholding tax is


-----

applicable subject to exceptions, certain of which being set forth below, and to more favourable
provisions of any applicable double tax treaty. The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective of
the tax residence of the Noteholder. The list of the Non-Cooperative States is published by a
ministerial executive order, which is updated on a yearly basis.

Furthermore, in application of Article 238 A of the French Code général des impôts, interest and other
revenues on such Notes are not deductible from the Issuer's taxable income inter alia if they are paid
or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid to a bank account
opened in a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State (the "Deductibility
**Exclusion"). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest and other revenues may be**
recharacterised as deemed distributions pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the French _Code général_
_des impôts, in which case such non-deductible interest and other revenues may be subject to the_
withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the French _Code général des impôts, at a rate of_
30% or 75% (subject to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A III of the
French _Code général des impôts nor the Deductibility Exclusion nor the withholding tax set out in_
Article 119 bis 2 of the French Code général des impôts will apply in respect of the issue of the Notes
if the Issuer can prove that the relevant interest or revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not
in an abnormal or exaggerated amount and that the principal purpose and effect of such issue of Notes
was not that of allowing the payments of interest or other revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative
State (the "Exception").

In addition, pursuant to French administrative guidelines (Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques –
Impôts) BOI-RPPM-RCM-30-10-20-40, n°70 and BOI-INT-DG-20-50, n° 990 dated 11 February
2014 and BOI-IR-DOMIC-10-20-20-60, n°10 dated 20 March 2015, the issue of the Notes will
benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any proof of the purpose and effect of
the issue of the Notes if such notes are, inter alia:

(i) offered by means of a public offer within the meaning of Article L. 411-1 of the French Code
monétaire et financier or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State other than a NonCooperative State. For this purpose, an “equivalent offer” means any offer requiring the
registration or submission of an offer document by or with a foreign securities market
authority; or

(ii) admitted to trading on a regulated market or on a French or foreign multilateral securities
trading system provided that such market or system is not located in a Non-Cooperative State,
and the operation of such market is carried out by a market operator or an investment services
provider, or by such other similar foreign entity, provided further that such market operator,
investment services provider or entity is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; or

(iii) admitted, at the time of their issue, to the clearing operations of a central depositary or of a
securities clearing and delivery and payments systems operator within the meaning of
Article L.561-2 of the French Code monétaire et financier, or of one or more similar foreign
depositaries or operators provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a NonCooperative State.

The Notes, which will be admitted to listing and to trading on Euronext Paris, and cleared through
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, will fall under the Exception. Consequently, payments of
interest and other revenues made by the Issuer under the Notes will be exempt from the withholding
tax set out under Article 125 A III of the French Code général des impôts.

Pursuant to Article 125 A of the French _Code général des impôts and subject to certain limited_
exceptions, interest and other revenues received under the Notes by individuals who are fiscally


-----

domiciled in France are subject to a 24% withholding tax, set out under Article 125 A I and III bis of
the French Code général des impôts. This withholding tax is an advance payment made in respect of
the personal income tax of the individual receiving the interest or revenue, which is deductible from
his personal income tax liability in respect of the year during which the withholding has been made.
Social contributions (CSG, CRDS and other related contributions) are also levied by way of
withholding at an aggregate rate of fifteen point five per cent. (15.5%) on interest and similar
revenues paid by the Issuer under the Notes, to individuals who are fiscally domiciled in France.
