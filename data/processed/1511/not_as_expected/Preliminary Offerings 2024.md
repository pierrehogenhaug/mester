retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of Directive (EU) No. 2014/65 (as amended, "MiFID II"); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus
Regulation. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as
amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available
to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise

by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes

Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "Distributor") should take into

The holder of each Note will have the option, following a Put Event to request the Issuer to redeem or propose the purchase of that

**_PRIIPS regulation / prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors – The Notes are not intended to be_**
_offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available_
_to any retail investor in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For these purposes, a retail investor_
_means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive_

_No. 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018_

_2000, as amended (the "FSMA") and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement_
_Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in_

**_MIFID II product governance / professional investors and ecps only target market – Solely for the_**

**_UK MIFIR product governance / professional investors and ecps only target market – Solely for_**
_the purposes of the manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in respect_
_of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible_
_counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook ("COBS"), and_
_professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by_
_virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 ("UK MiFIR"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of_
_the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently_
_offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "UK Distributor") should take into consideration the_
_manufacturer’s target market assessment; however, a UK Distributor subject to the FCA Handbook_
_Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the "UK MiFIR Product Governance_
**_Rules") is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either_**
_adopting or refining the manufacturer’s target market assessment) and determining appropriate_
_distribution channels._

**_Suitability of investment in the Notes_**

_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors. Each potential investor in the Notes must_
_determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular, each potential_
_investor should:_

_(a)_ _have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the_
_merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by_
_reference in this Prospectus or any applicable supplement;_

_(b)_ _have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its_
_particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on_
_its overall investment portfolio;_

_(c)_ _have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the_
_Notes, including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the_
_potential investor's currency or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different_
_from the currency in which such potential investor’s financial activities are principally_
_denominated;_

_(d)_ _understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant_
_financial markets;_

_(e)_ _be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for_
_economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear_
_the applicable risks; and_

_(f)_ _consult their legal advisers in relation to possible legal, tax, accounting, regulatory and related_
_aspects of any investment in the Notes._

**_Consideration relating to credit rating of the Notes and the Issuer_**

_The rating assigned to the Notes by each rating agency is based on the Issuer’s financial situation but_
_takes into account other relevant structural features of the transaction, including, inter alia, the terms of_
_the Notes, and reflects only the views of such rating agency. A rating may not reflect the potential impact_
_of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed in this paragraph, and other factors_
_that may affect the value of the Notes. The rating addresses the likelihood of full and timely payment to_
_the Noteholders of all payments of interest on each interest payment date and repayment of principal on_
_the final payment date. There is no assurance that any such rating will continue for any period of time or_
_that they will not be reviewed, revised, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agency as a result_
_of changes in or unavailability of information or if, in the rating agency’s judgement, circumstances so_

5


-----

_warrant. A credit rating and/or a corporate rating are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities._
_Any adverse change in an applicable credit rating could adversely affect the trading price for the Notes._

_In addition, S&P or any other rating agency may change its methodologies or their application for rating_
_securities with features similar to the Notes in the future. This may include the relationship between_
_ratings assigned to an issuer's senior securities and ratings assigned to securities with features similar_
_to the Notes, sometimes called "notching". If the rating agencies were to change their practices or their_
_application for rating such securities in the future, the ratings of the Notes may be subsequently lowered._

_The Issuer is rated [BB+ (stable outlook)] by S&P. The credit rating of the Issuer is an assessment of its_
_ability to pay its obligations, including those arising from the Notes. Consequently, declines in the credit_

## 1 RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE ISSUER

In an ever-evolving environment, Nexans is dedicated to protecting the safety and health as well
as the interests of its employees, the interests of its shareholders, clients, suppliers, and all of its
stakeholders, while achieving its objectives. To navigate this landscape, Nexans has implemented
a proactive risk management policy to efficiently respond to any internal and external threats likely
to affect its finance, operations, reputation or future prospects. Given Nexans’ global presence, the
competitive nature of the cable industry and the diversity of its businesses, Nexans faced a variety
of risks, both endogenous and exogenous. Nexans diligently manages Strategic, Operational,
Legal and Compliance, and Financial risks to not only minimize their occurrence but also to mitigate
their potential impact. To achieve this, the Group has established and consistently enhances its
risk management processes and organization.

As part of Nexans’ risk management process, the Group has conducted an assessment to identify
the primary risk factors it faces.

Pursuant to the provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament
and of the Council, this section entitled "Risk Factors relating to the Issuer” outlines the main
specific risks that could, on the date of this Prospectus, impact the Group’s business, financial
condition, outlook reputation, operational results or ability to achieve its objectives. The 15 risks
are clustered in four categories (Strategic Risks, Operational Risks, Legal and Compliance Risks,
and Financial Risks). These 15 risks are, however, not exhaustive and other risks or uncertainties,
whether unknown or not considered herein at the date of this Prospectus, could occur or arise and
have a material adverse effect on the Group.

In term of methodology, the 15 identified risks are those which are specifically pertinent to Nexans
and have the most significant net impact. The ranking is based on the assessment of i) the highest
level of criticality (potential impact on the Group multiplied by probability of occurrence), and ii) for
each risk the effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures deployed by the Group to prevent and/or
minimize their impact. Then, the risks are ordered by their level of importance, and within each
category, those with the greatest residual exposure are presented first. The Group classifies the
residual risks on a scale ranging from “low”, “moderate”, “material” to “critical”.

This section entitled "Risk Factors relating to the Issuer” exclusively outlines risks that have been
assessed as either “material” or “critical”.

8


-----

1) Other risks such as health and safety as well as human risks:

− These risks relate to issues of primary and vital importance for Nexans. Although they may
not be categorized as specific to Nexans, the Group constantly deploys and monitors
preventive measures or actions to limit the occurrence of those risks and minimize their
impacts.

− A comprehensive overview of the main non-financial risks and the policies in place to
prevent or mitigate their occurrence are presented in detail in the Non-Financial
Performance Statement.

2) Other risks such as talent scarcity:

− These risks, which are not specific to Nexans, relate to Group’s internal and external
development partly dependent on its ability to hire, integrate and retain new talents in all
the regions in which it operates. More generally, the Group may be face difficulties in hiring
talents and developing the skills and talents of all staff members.

3) Other risks such as market and innovation risks:

− These are risks with medium or long-term trends that may impact the Group’s strategy and
business model.

4) Other financial risks such as risk of internal control and tax risks:

− These risks are considered “moderate risks” in the current context. In addition, measures
are deployed to prevent and/or mitigate their potential impact.

**RECESSION ENVIRONMENT**

Nexans is committed to maintaining and improving its performance, even in the face of geopolitical
and economic uncertainty. In terms of potential risk of recession, Nexans deems it non-specific and
not material for the following reasons:

1) the Generation & Transmission business is minimally affected thanks to its robust backlog

providing visibility, and a surge in demand for high voltage cables, especially within the
renewable energy sector. Any impacts, if at all, might be associated with customers
deferring projects due to cost increase stemming from an inflationary environment;

2) the impacts on the Distribution business is limited thanks to 2 to 3 years frame-agreements

with key customers ensuring committed volumes, as well as the increased demand for
medium voltage cables aiming at strengthening and modernizing the power grid. Any
impacts, if at all, might be associated with customers deferring projects due to cost
increase stemming from an inflationary environment;

3) the Usages segment is more exposed to economic slowdowns. However, Nexans

considers it can mitigate its impacts for the following key reasons:

− Nexans’ business model prioritizes value growth over volumes, providing a resilient
foundation,

− the economic slowdown doesn’t uniformly affect the entire Group and the Group leverages
its presence in different regions. For instance, in 2023, economic slowdowns were
particularly acute in countries such as Ghana, Colombia, Lebanon and China, but lower in
other countries,

9


-----

− the Group actively anticipates risks of slowdown and deploy proactive measures to mitigate
the effects such as cost reductions, or shift to other markets.

⚫ Liquidity risk


(i) Risk description

Certain high-growth regions playing a role in the Group’s strategic are exposed to
significant geopolitical risks. In 2023, around 9% of the Group’s sales at current non-ferrous
metal prices were generated in the Middle East & Africa region and around 2% from
countries classified by the Group’s credit insurer as having “a very unsettled economic and
political environment” or posing a very high risk. With respect to the conflict between Russia
and Ukraine, Nexans maintains a presence in Ukraine through Nexans Autoelectric a unit
specializing in the manufacturing of automotive harnesses, operating three plants in
Western part of Ukraine. The Group’s total assets in Ukraine represent less than 1% of the
consolidated balance sheet of the Group.

A key element of Nexans’ strategy involves expanding in high-growth regions, including
South America and Africa, which may be subject to geopolitical, political and social
instabilities. Early 2023 social instabilities and political tensions in Peru and Ecuador
following respectively destitution of the Peruvian President in December 2022 and
Presidential elections in 2023 might have impacted business activities, and were closely
monitored and managed.

The evolving relations between China and the United States are also factor of risks and
uncertainties, encompassing potential trade policy changes that may affect customs
protection and export controls regulations.

US political approach to windfarm may affect our business activity for G&T business group.

The enduring Gulf crisis continues to alter the export opportunities for the Group’s
subsidiary in Qatar (consolidated by equity method) to the Gulf states, with conditions
remaining uncertain.

With respect to Lebanon, since 2020, persistent political and economic instability has led
in particular to a strict foreign exchange control policy by Lebanese banks, affecting
activities of the subsidiary in Lebanon. Additionally, since October 2023, Lebanon is
affected by the military conflict between Israel and Palestine.

In an environment shaped by chronic budget deficits in emerging countries in the past
several years, governments are tending to introduce stricter tax laws in order to maximize
their income from taxes and levies. Consequently, these governments take positions that
could lead to legal disputes or double taxation issues. In some countries (in particular in

10


-----

non OCDE countries), the Group may face issues of tax instability and uncertainties which
could affect the financial results of Group’s operating entities.

Lastly, economic recession in some countries may lead to economic and social instabilities,
with potential implications materializing in 2024 and subsequent years.

(ii) Risk management response

The Group closely monitors its industrial and commercial operations and its turnkey
projects in countries exposed to geopolitical risks, including but not limited to Ukraine,
Brazil, China, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Qatar, Lebanon, Libya, Tunisia, Philippines,
Nigeria and Turkey.

The systematic and continuous review of the most current geopolitical situation is
embedded in the Group’s investment decision-making processes, including for M&A
initiatives.

To minimize any potential impacts of geopolitical, political and social instability risk, the
Group is i) developing a policy of diversification of suppliers and internal sourcing and ii)
continuously enhancing its Business Continuity Management processes at its industrial
sites.

Finally, for several years, the Group has been vigilant in monitoring export control
regulations.

With respect to the military conflicts between Ukraine and Russia as well as between Israel
and Palestine, since the beginning of the conflicts, the Group has been monitoring the
related risks very closely, focusing first on protecting employees as well as the supply chain
and business continuity. In order to limit its exposure to Russia, end of July 2022, the Group
has divested its minority shareholding in Impex, a company based in Russia.

**Risk related to the competitive environment of the Group’s operating subsidiaries**


RISK RANKING


Potential impacts on the Group Main correlated Risks


⚫ Decrease in sales volumes


⚫ Risks related to M&A operations


⚫ Pressure on the selling price

(i) Risk description

The number and size of competitors of the Group’s operating companies vary depending
on the market, geographical area and product line.

The medium and low voltage cable markets are very competitive, both regionally and
internationally.

In addition to large-scale global competitors, new market players have more recently
emerged, which are drawing on low-cost production equipment and organizational
structures and therefore creating additional capacity and an extremely competitive
environment (both domestically and internationally). These players have emerged over the
last ten years and are growing rapidly, in many regions of the world including in Southern
and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Korea, China but also in South America and
Africa.

11


-----

In the high voltage cable market an escalation in competition both from existing operators
and from new players, not necessarily from the industry but with leaner and more flexible
organizational models, and/or significant financial resources, could have an impact.

(ii) Risk management response

In high voltage markets, throughout the years, Nexans has prioritized on innovative
technologies, investment in differentiating assets such as the Nexans Aurora cable-laying
vessel, building up its EPCI know-how, and consolidating its track record. This focus
ensures smooth project execution, the delivery of high quality product and centricity
customer approach, while always abiding by this risk-reward mindset. Nexans’ risk
management starts at the very earliest stage and as early as the tendering phase. In order
to abide by Nexans commitment to focus and generate value, the Group ensures strict and
comprehensive selectivity criteria. For each project, notably for Interconnections and Wind
Offshore activities representing a value above 5 million euros, Nexans/rigorously applies
its risk and reward analysis, combining three fundamental dimensions: i) financial
modelling, ii) technological risk and iii) the terms and conditions. This holistic approach
ensures the maintenance of a healthy and balanced backlog, aligning with Nexans’
commitment to excellence and risk mitigation.

In medium and low voltage businesses, Nexans relies on its diversified and strong local
presence. As part of its SHIFT Prime program, the Group is strengthening its brand and
customer relationship, and provides a full portfolio of solutions for customers from product
to sub-systems and services.

Nexans also reinforces its offer in selected markets through strategic acquisitions.

**Risk related to M&A**


RISK RANKING


Potential impacts on the Group Main correlated Risks


⚫ Difficulty in realizing identified synergies

⚫ Difficulty of integration endangering operating

performance of the facilities


⚫ Compliance risk

⚫ Risk of liquidity


(i) Risk description

Nexans pursues a strategy to become an electrification pure player, through a portfolio
rotation relying on both acquisitions in electrification markets and the disposal of non-core
activities.

The primary risk associated with this strategy lies in the Group’s effectiveness in
concurrently divesting non-electrification activities while acquiring identified targets in the
electrification sector.

(ii) Risk management response

The Group is conducting detailed market analysis to identify the best merger and
acquisition opportunities aligning with its strategy. Strategic fit of potential targets is closely
evaluated, considering factors such as the market attractiveness of the business, the
potential to create value and potential synergies with Nexans. This diligent approach
ensures that each pursued opportunity not only aligns with the Group’s overarching

12


-----

strategy but also possesses the potential to enhance market positioning, create sustainable
value, and leverage synergies for mutual benefit.

The Group has implemented specific processes and governance structure for each project,
in particular the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee responsible for reviewing and
approving all acquisition and divestment projects.

Each acquisition undergoes a robust due diligence process with the support of internal
specialists and/or external experts or advisors as the case may be. This approach enables
to identify potential risks related to the acquired company and implement mitigation action,
whether by obtaining a price reduction or contractual provisions such as indemnification
clauses. In addition, an integration plan process led by an integration project manager is
executed under the supervision of a member of the Executive Committee.

With respect to disposals, the Mergers & Acquisitions Department leads initiatives with the
support of recognized external advisors to prevent any risks.

Based on the above, the Group has successfully completed the following transactions, and
for acquisitions deployed synergies ahead of plan:

       - Acquisitions:

− on 1 April 2022, Nexans finalized the acquisition of Centelsa, a premium
cable maker in Latin America active in the production of low and medium
voltages cables from Xignux,

− on 26 April 2023, Nexans announced that it has completed the acquisition
of REKA Cables, a Finnish company active in the manufacturing of low and
medium voltages cables for the Usages and Distribution applications. This
acquisition will strengthen Nexans’ position in the Nordics notably in the
segment Distribution and Usages;

       - Disposals:

− on 31 October 2023, Nexans has completed the sale of its Telecom
Systems business, rebranded to Aginode, to Syntagma Capital, a Belgiumbased private equity fund.

(i) Risk description

Nexans’ business fully relies on information technology, systems and infrastructure
(datacenters, servers and networks). Like any organization using information technology,
the Group is exposed to the risk of cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks could originate from within
the Group (system obsolescence, configuration or human errors, lack of infrastructure
maintenance, malicious acts) – or from outside Nexans (criminal organizations acting on
their own behalf or that of State organizations).

Technically advanced in the world of information systems as well as in industrial systems,
benefiting of important means, these attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
can lead to business interruption, theft of know-how or confidential information, fraud
attempts or ransomware with financial and reputational impacts which can be potentially
extremely high. It is important to highlight that any crisis, such as the Covid-19 pandemic,
is capable of exacerbating the risk of cyber-attacks also due to the widespread policies of
remote and home working activities.

Due to the global presence of the Group, Nexans’ business activity requires multiple and
often interconnected information systems, IT applications as well as industrial information
systems. In addition, the implementation of more digital initiatives, new services for
customers and partners, and potentially disruptive technologies increase Nexans’ potential
exposure to cyber security threats, including without limitation, denial of service attacks,
industrial espionage, and ransomware attacks.

Any disruption or interruption of service could potentially affect multiple regions and
businesses, with significant disruption on i) industrial processes (disturbance of production
or distribution activities) and ii) the capacity for internal communication. It could also affect
our business partners, customers and suppliers. Finally, it could also affect Group’s image.

This risk enrolls itself in a context of reinforced regulatory requirements related to protection
and confidentiality of data.

(ii) Risk management response

The cyber security team, led by the Chief Information Security Officer, is a core part of the
Risk Management Department and is fully committed to cyber risk. It outlines and executes
policies and projects pertinent to the cyber security program as well as personal data
protection. It also devises guidelines for the use of information and industrial systems
across the Group. Cybersecurity Incident Management is integral part of cyber risk
management. The cybersecurity team proactively manages alerts of cybersecurity
incidents, conducts detailed investigations of the said alerts, and implements remediation
of identified cybersecurity incidents. Additionally, the cyber security team is tasked with
carrying out regular security audits and testing on the Group’s critical business and
industrial assets, with the support of external service providers.

Operational teams of the Corporate Information System Department and of the Business
Groups Information System Departments in collaboration with the cyber security teams are
continuously strengthening Group’s cyber security processes and tools. This commitment
is structured around the three fundamental axes of cybersecurity: to prevent, detect, and
respond to cyber incidents, in close collaboration with their service providers.

In recent years, cybersecurity governance has been enhanced through the development
of a network of correspondents within Business Groups and factories. This network

14


-----

facilitates the effective dissemination and application of Nexans General Management
Procedure regarding cyber risk management, in synergy with the central cyber team. Cyber
securities issues and measures implemented to safeguard against cyber security are
evaluated annually with the Business Groups EVP and presented on a regular basis to the
Nexans Executive Committee. Besides, with the support of the Risk Management
Department in 2023, central cyber team run a cyber security risk assessment to support
the design of the cyber security action plan.

In addition, Cyber security program and realization of the actions plan are regularly
presented to the Accounts, Audit and Risk Committee.

The cybersecurity team has designed a cyber security program based on 4 pillars:

1) raise awareness and empower Nexans’ employees and contractors to effectively
thwart threats by placing them at the center of its detection and response
capabilities:

− an online training is required for all new employees and any person failing
a phishing campaign,

− monthly communications are published reminding Cybersecurity user’s
best practices. In addition, a Cyber Month is organized in October with
communication tailored to specific targeted populations, such as Industrial
Workers, the Legal Team…,

− phishing campaigns are performed several times per year. In 2023, 7
phishing campaigns were performed,

− Nexans’ Information and Cyber Risk policy is regularly updated, to be
adapted to emerging threats. In 2022 the End-user Security policy has been
updated and communicated during Nexans annual Compliance Week. The
objective of this End-user Security policy is to advise users on key rules to
be applied when using Nexans’ information system tools so that to avoid
cyber incidents;

2) protect key technological assets and among others industrial activities by
controlling access to information and their treatments:

− in particular, any IT project is analyzed to assess the level of business
impacts in case of a security incident. Based on a risk analysis, security
controls – technical, operational as organizational – are defined and their
implementation controlled,

− as part of our Industry 4.0 transformation program, a dedicated stream is
deploying an OT Threat detection and protection solutions in our factories.
This deployment will continue in the coming years to reach all industrial
sites,

− based on an approach of defense, the teams of the Information System
Department have deployed security technologies such as web filtering,
email analysis, endpoint detection and response on workstations and
servers, network segmentation,

− Nexans has implemented access control solutions of last generation
enhancing management of access and their related controls;

15


-----

3) respond to any threat and cyber incident as soon as possible to limit the adverse
impact on the business and industrial operations:

− threats are constantly monitored and security incidents detected thanks to
our enhanced Security Operations Center (SOC), including in the industrial
environment,

− cybersecurity incidents are timely and adequately handled by means of an
internal crisis response team integrating internal and external experts in
cyber security thanks to specialized probes,

− to prevent any situation such as a Cyber security attack whereby Nexans
would forbid its employees access to Nexans IT systems, the Group has
acquired a tool to manage crisis which is independent from Nexans IT
system,

− Nexans has subscribed a cyber security insurance whereby an insurer is
partnering Nexans should the Group was to face cyber incidents or attacks;

4) control the effectiveness of operated security tool and controls and provide means
of continuous improvement:

− cyber penetration tests are performed on a yearly basis on Group’s key
business and industrial systems to identify the main vulnerabilities and
develop mitigation actions,

− specific security acceptance tests are performed in the phase of
development of business, industrial and IT projects before going into
production.

**Risks related to climate change and natural hazards**


RISK RANKING


Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks


⚫ Business impact – Disruption of activity

⚫ Financial impact

⚫ Destruction of physical assets


⚫ Risk related to the safety of Nexans employees

⚫ Assets physical risk

⚫ Business continuity risk


(i) Risk description

With respect to physical risks, some of the Group’s manufacturing sites are located in areas
at risk of natural disasters (earthquakes like in Morocco in 2023, tornadoes, floods, heat
waves, etc.).

For example, the Charleston plant in the United States is located next to a river and enjoys
access to the sea; the area is prone to hurricanes. The site is therefore subject to natural
disaster risks that were taken fully into account at the time of its construction. Although the
Group draws up a systematic audit plan of its sites in cooperation with its property insurer
for the purpose of implementing plant integrity risk management processes, it is impossible
to rule out all risks of production stoppages.

Climate change is creating new sources of risk for the Group by increasing the frequency
and impacts of perils (like floods, droughts, cyclones, etc.). The occurrence of such perils

16


-----

may cause disruption to the Group’s organization or operations which may have a
significant impact on the business.

Lastly, like other international organizations, Nexans activities may be exposed to a risk of
energy transition (which arise from the transition to a low-carbon economy). The Group has
been committed to reducing its environmental impacts. This responsibility applies not only
to the Group’s sites but also to the design of its products as well as to its value chain.

The Group also designs energy efficiency products and solutions. Nevertheless, it may be
unable to meet stakeholders’ expectations in terms of addressing environmental and
climate risks. This may relate to decarbonization efforts and the increasing desire to reduce
energy consumption.

(ii) Risk management response

Nexans is continuously assessing risks related to natural disasters with the support of its
property insurer reviewing in the meantime the mitigations plan to be implemented to better
mitigate the impacts of such risks should a natural disaster occur.

With respect to perils related to climate change, the Group has decided to lead, with the
support of a recognized service provider, a physical risk analysis more detailed compared
to 2021 study and covering this time all industrial sites of Nexans Group. Based on this
physical risk analysis giving the gross risk, the Group has launched with the most exposed
industrial sites an assessment of the adaptation measures already implemented and will
decide in a second stage a further detailed adaptation plan if needed.

When investing in industrial sites especially when exposed to high risks of natural hazards,
the Group ensures technical solutions are defined to reduce impacts of such natural
disaster risks. This has been the case like in Charleston or more recently for the extension
of Halden. For example, In Charleston, several adaptation measures have been
implemented to mitigate the risks:

    - in the facility design: several measures have been taken such as all roof elements
are attached with Hurricane Approved fasteners;

    - in the site design: for illustration, the site was purposely built up to have the Building
Elevation at 15 foot (4.5 meters);

    - with an emergency management plan in particular relate to hurricane where
designated plant personnel follow and coordinate with local county and state
emergency Management Departments when a hurricane has formed in the region.

Additionally, employees are regularly trained to adequately react should natural disaster
event take place. Business continuity plans are developed, and crisis management
processes are in place to manage exceptional natural events.

With respect to transition risk, the Group has led, with the support of a recognized service
provider, in 2023 a further detailed study (aligned with TCFD guidelines) to assess the risks
and opportunities related to climate. From the study, it appears that climate change could
lead to business opportunities for Nexans.

**Risks related to Generation & Transmission turnkey projects**


RISK RANKING


Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks


⚫ Group reputation

⚫ Financial impact


⚫ Risk related to claims and legal proceedings

⚫ Risk related to contractual liability: product liability

⚫ Risk related to the competitive environment of the Group’s


operating subsidiaries

(i) Risk description

The majority of contracts as part of turnkey projects involve both subsea and land highvoltage cable operations. The sales generated on such projects vary from one year to
another and represent approximately 12% of Group consolidated sales at constant nonferrous metal prices.

The individual value of these contracts is often high and they contain penalty and liability
clauses that could be triggered if a Group company does not comply with the delivery
schedule and/or with quality requirements (for example, technical defects requiring major
intervention after installation). The two market segments in which Nexans is mainly
engaged are, on the one hand, the interconnection and electrification projects (land and
subsea), and on the other hand, the offshore wind projects. Trends in these two markets
are i) the increase in the size of projects, and ii) increased technical complexity with
increased water depths, bigger size cables and dynamic applications. In this regard, it is to
be noted that these trends take place in a context where some customers have increased
their requirements as to the level of risk-liability that suppliers must be prepared to assume
in order to be awarded the project.

Risks related to the expansion in the United States

The US market for high voltage cables is expected to show strong growth, driven by the
development of offshore wind farms to support the energy transition. The United States are
targeting 30 GW of installed offshore wind capacities by 2030. For this purpose, the Group
has transformed its high voltage subsea cable plant in Charleston, South Carolina, United
States, to supply the rapidly expanding US offshore wind market. The one-of-a-kind
subsea, sole high voltage cable plant in the United States of America, contributes to the
development of a local supply chain and supports for the offshore wind industry.

The Group is exposed inter alia to the following risks:

    - cancellations and or delays to awarded projects;

    - duration of the permit process dependent of the political context;

    - market dependent of subsidies/financing. For the sake of illustration, New York
Public Service Commission rejected in September 2023 the request for higher rates
from offshore wind developers;

    - costs increase which may render projects less profitable; and

    - regulations changes at Federal State and/or local States level which could incur a
reinforcement of local content regulations and potentially impact Nexans sales in
the US market.

18


-----

Risks related to projects size and complexity

Due to the amplification in complexity and/or size of interconnection subsea projects (such
as Great Sea) as well as of offshore wind projects (Empire Wind 1) together with the
increased volume of backlog, Nexans operating entities have to manage multiple
subcategories of risks such as:

- high value sub-contract packages (in particular off-shore protection, on-shore civil
works) requiring from Nexans operating entities a high level of expertise in such
packages as well as the ability to select robust subcontractors and to manage them;

- technical challenges such as increased voltages and depth of installations;

- potential claims related to delivery schedule and/or with quality requirements;

- price volatility on raw materials and energy costs in particular in a context of
inflation;

- complexity of the costing scheme in the pricing of the turnkey project;

- delays in the manufacturing schedule. The Group might face difficulties in
assessing when final award of turnkey projects will take place as this depend on
several factors, inter alia of the customers’ ability in finding financing. Delays could
impact Nexans forecasts and ability of Nexans to bid for such turnkey projects.

Risk related to human resources

The Group’s internal and external development is partly dependent on its ability to hire,
integrate, train, motivate, promote and retain new talent in all the regions in which it
operates for its high voltage activity (in particular in the US market). Due to the increase in
complexity and size of the projects of interconnection subsea projects as well as of offshore
wind projects, the need to manage important sub-contract portion and the significant
increase in key assets to manage.

Risk of contractual liability

This risk is significative due to i) the increase in the size of the projects and ii) the number
of projects taken which make the cumulative exposure higher.

Risks related to deterioration of key assets

Should Nexans suffer damage and/or deterioration on key assets for the land and subsea
high voltage activities (including vessels or industrial sites), this could result in particular
delays in projects.

Risk in project execution

Projects can depend on and/or be affected by the occurrence of unforeseen events or the
existence of circumstances that were not taken into account during the project preparation
phase. When such events or circumstances arise, the Group company concerned
sometimes are able to agree with the customer to amend the related contractual provisions,
but that company may have to temporarily or permanently carry extra costs.

If a Group company is held liable for a problem in connection with a turnkey contract, this
could have a material adverse effect on the financial position and earnings of the Group as
a whole as (i) heavy penalties may be incurred, (ii) all or some of the cables concerned
may have to be replaced (before or after delivery), (iii) claims may be filed against then

19


-----

Group company involved, (iv) warranty periods may have to be extended, and/or (v) the
liability may result in other more far-reaching consequences such as production delays for
other projects. Should the Group or its companies be subject to any such claims, the Group
takes their impact into account when calculating the margins recognized on the contracts
concerned, as described in Note 1.E.a to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements (as
defined in section entitled “Documents Incorporated by Reference”).

(ii) Risk management response

For US expansion

To address the risks related to US expansion, the following measures are in place:

    - Nexans has signed a framework agreement with Eversource and Ørsted to supply
the first US-made subsea high voltage export cables for the projects and will deliver
up to 1,000 km of cables for Ørsted’s and Eversource offshore wind farms in North
America up until 2027;

    - a dedicated team has been appointed to ensure a timely ramp up of our high
voltage subsea cable plant in Charleston;

    - in addition of the decision to transform its high voltage subsea cable plant in
Charleston, South Carolina, United States, Nexans is closely following and
monitoring any potential evolution of regulations in relation with local content
issues;

    - Nexans will continue the project Empire Wind 1 (the US offshore wind export cables
turnkey contract awarded in 2022). The project is part of the larger Empire Wind
offshore wind farm that will generate enough renewable energy to energize over
one million homes in New York state.

For amplified complexity and size in turnkey projects

To address the risks on turnkey projects, the Group has developed detailed risk
management system for turnkey projects based on the following:

    - all major contracts entered into by the Group’s operating subsidiaries are subject
to a systematic risk-assessment procedure and all bids representing over 25 million
euros for the Business Group Generation & Transmission are submitted to the
Group Tender Review Committee. Particular focus is placed on ensuring that the
Group’s sales and technical teams are able to pinpoint the risks inherent in sales
contracts and that they involve the Legal Department in contractual negotiations;

    - the execution of the projects are directly managed by a Project Director who relies
on specialized teams tasked with delivering the project within budget, with the right
quality and on time. In addition, the teams ensure the proper implementation of the
Group’s risk management policy. In this context, the teams implement a continuous
risk assessment and implementation of actions to identify and mitigate risks which
may appear during project execution;

    - quality policy and control procedures are in place to monitor quality in production;

    - production sites are ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 certified;

    - technology aimed at guaranteeing customers reliable industrial processes as well
as high quality and performance of the products;

20


-----

    - launching of the manufacturing of a new vessel for implementation of new
installation capacity in addition to Skagerrak and Nexans Aurora;

    - the Group has subscribed a Construction All Risk (CAR) insurance program
specifically designed to address turnkey project risks;

    - Nexans is in partnership with Bureau Veritas aimed at certifying Nexans’
organization and risk management processes for the execution of turnkey projects;

    - cables are tested several times: i) before the start of manufacturing, ii) before
delivery subject to factory acceptance tests (FAT) and iii) after installation and
before entry into service (Site Acceptance Test);

    - entering into strategic partnerships with sub-contractors;

    - experienced staff resources to manage early engagement of sub-contractors from
tender stage onwards;

    - the recruitment of qualified human resources via post graduate programs and the
development of retention program.

The Business Group Generation and Transmission continuously review its processes and
organization to better adapt to this change in project size and complexity.

**Risk related to price fluctuations and availability of non-ferrous metals**


RISK RANKING


Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks


⚫ Financial impact (liquidated damages for delay, claims

for damages, etc.)

⚫ Business interruption

⚫ Sales decline


⚫ Metal price risk and hedges of price volatility


(i) Risk description

The cable industry is highly dependent on the supply of core raw materials (in particular
copper, aluminum and lead).

Copper, aluminum and lead are the main non-ferrous metals used by the Group’s operating
companies, with copper and aluminum accounting for the vast majority of their raw material
purchases.

Consequently, price fluctuations and product availability have a direct effect on the Group’s
business. In that respect, the Group is constantly assessing the risks of supply tension on
raw material prices and availability.

Copper purchases in 2023 amounted to around 413,000 tons (versus 460,000 tons in
2022), excluding the approximately 132,000 tons processed on behalf of customers. To
cover their main requirements, Group companies enter into annual contracts with various
copper producers for the purchase of pre-determined amounts. The Group’s aluminum
purchases in 2023 totaled 99,000 tons (versus 108,000 tons in 2022).

21


-----

Risk of shortages

The Group does not rule out the possibility that supply and demand tensions on copper
and aluminum markets could lead to supply shortages and thus have an impact on its
activities.

Global shortages, supply interruptions or the inability to obtain non-ferrous metals at
commercially reasonable prices could have an adverse effect on the Group’s earnings.

Risk of price volatility

With respect to price volatility, should the price of its supplies increase, the Group may not
be able to fully pass on the increases to its customers and may face pressure on credit line
of copper suppliers who will be requiring payments spot. In addition to price risk, due to its
multi-country and multi-zone sourcing policy, the Group has an indirect exposure to foreign
exchange risk on its purchases of oil by-products (plastics, etc.), natural gas and steel,
which together account for a large proportion of total raw materials purchases other than
non-ferrous metals.

Additional risks can also be linked to the fact that non-ferrous metal markets (copper,
aluminum and lead) work on the basis of take or pay contracts.

Finally, apart from cyclical events, the tensions on the commodities market are also due to
structural factors. These elements are linked to an increasing demand for green energy
supply, net zero emissions targets and broader climate issues. They are driving a sharp
increase in the consumption of certain raw materials, while also impelling a search for
substitute raw materials that are more environmentally friendly.

(ii) Risk management response

To reduce risks related to non-ferrous metals, the Group has developed various mitigation
actions including in particular:

    - the Group’s policy is to secure its non-ferrous metals requirements under long-term
contracts including significant upward and downward flexibility in order to make
sure the Group’s requirements are always met;

    - as regards to copper supply, thanks to Nexans’ vertical integration with 4 rodmills
worldwide, the Group enjoys a privileged supply position with the mining industry;

    - as a general principle, risks related to the supply of non-ferrous metal are
specifically monitored by non-ferrous metal management. The supply strategy
based on close relationships with a number of key partners is aimed at reducing
the Group’s exposure to shortages. The Group assesses the financial vulnerability
of its most critical partners and ensures that they have robust business continuity
plans in place. The Group’s policy is to develop alternative sources of supplies for
non-ferrous metal used in the manufacturing of Nexans products (“multi-source
strategy”);

    - the Group has developed alternative sources to Russian origin metal.

The financial instruments used by Group subsidiaries to manage exposure to commodities
risks for copper and aluminum are described in the notes to the 2023 Consolidated
Financial Statements (Note 27 “Financial risks”, paragraph C, Foreign exchange and metal
price risks). The sensitivity of the Group’s earnings to copper prices is described in
paragraph E, Market risk sensitivity analysis of the same note.

Group’s operating subsidiaries


Production sites maintenance and capital expenditure

As the Group’s operating companies carry out manufacturing activities, they are exposed
to the risk of damage to their production sites as well as major machinery breakdown
incidents, which could lead to production stoppages and significant adverse consequences.

Some aging industrial sites require permanent investment to avoid deterioration of the
working conditions and participate actively to workplace safety. In that respect, employee
safety is an absolute priority for the Group and remain an important area of focus of the
management.

In view of the importance to the Group of the subsea high-voltage cables market, the Group
has implemented significant capital expenditure project to support business growth:

- first, to meet the demand of the market for subsea high voltage cable worldwide,
Nexans is making significant capital investments to extend its industrial site of
Halden (Norway) and further enhance the capability of Charleston (USA). The ramp
of the extension of Halden site will be critical for the development of Nexans Norway
activity to meet the high demand of the market;

- second, the Group is launching the manufacturing of a new cable-laying vessel
capable of performing installation contracts within the required timeframes in
addition of its current cable-laying vessels (the Skagerrak and the Aurora which
came in operation on May 2021). The delivery on time of the new vessel targeted
in spring 2026 will be key to meet the increase demand in cable-laying;

- third, in view of the significant increase of the electrification of the grids, the Group
has announced a major investment in Morocco to support the development of the
Distribution segment. This greenfield will be a major asset for the Group to continue
is role in the expansion and renewal of medium voltage grids.

When implementing capital expenditure projects, the Group is exposed to the risk of failing
to achieve its targets in particular should Nexans operating entities fail to fill its increased
production and/or installation capacity or lack ability to deliver cables and services under
the required technical specificities or according to the expected schedule. This could have
a material impact, particularly in the case of new equipment or new plants built with a view
to enabling the Group to break into markets where it does not have an operating presence
or has a limited presence.

Environmental Impacts

As is the case for any industrial player, the Group is subject to numerous environmental
laws and regulations in the countries where it operates. These laws and regulations impose
increasingly strict environmental standards, particularly concerning emissions to air, water

23


-----

and land, wastewater disposal, the emission, use and handling of toxic waste and
materials, waste disposal methods and site clean-up operations. Consequently, the
Group’s operating subsidiaries are exposed to the possibility of liability claims being filed
against them, and of incurring significant costs (e.g., for liability with respect to current or
past activities or related to assets sold).

In the United States, the Group’s operating companies are subject to several federal and
state environmental laws, under which certain categories of entity (as defined by law) can
be held liable for the full amount of environmental clean-up costs, even if no fault against
said entity is determined or even if the relevant operations comply with the applicable
regulations.

The Group may also be subject to certain clean-up obligations (remediations works and/or
monitoring obligations) including when it discontinues operations of a site.

As of 31 December 2023, consolidated provisions for environmental risks amounted to
approximately 5 million euros and mainly included amounts set aside for (i) clean-up costs
for several manufacturing sites and (ii) a dispute with the purchasers of a plot of land and
the local authorities in Duisburg, Germany concerning soil and groundwater pollution. The
Group has also performed surveys at its sites in order to establish whether any
environmental clean-up processes may be required. It estimates that any site clean-up
costs it may incur that have not already been provisioned should not have a material impact
on its earnings in view of the value of the land concerned, which in the past has always
exceeded the amount of any required clean-up costs.

The Group cannot guarantee that future events, in particular changes in legislation or the
development or discovery of new facts or circumstances, will not lead to additional costs
that could have a material adverse effect on its business, earnings or financial position.

Asbestos

The manufacturing processes used by the Group’s various operating subsidiaries do not
involve any handling of asbestos.

In the past (and particularly to comply with French army specifications), asbestos was used
to a limited extent, within the framework of applicable laws and regulatory provisions, to
improve the insulation of certain kinds of cables designed for military purposes. It was also
used in the manufacture of furnaces for enamel wire at two sites in France and in
continuous casting at one site in France. The manufacture of furnaces for enamel wire
activity was discontinued a long time ago. Several claims and lawsuits have been filed
against the Group by current and former employees, in France and abroad, concerning
alleged exposure to asbestos.

In March 2015 the site concerned was classified by the French government as a site that
could entitle workers to retire early as a result of their exposure to asbestos (known as
ACAATA sites). In 2020, the Administrative Court of Appeal confirmed a decision of
administrative court to cancel the classification by the French government.

As of the date of this Prospectus, only 3 judicial proceedings remain regarding 3 plaintiffs.

Similar proceedings are also under way in France for other industrial sites for three Nexans’
employees among which two judicial proceeding concern employees who alleged to have
suffered exposition to asbestos in industrial sites which were not at the time under Nexans
responsibility.

24


-----

In addition, for historical reasons, in some buildings built before asbestos bans adopted
locally country by country, there can be presence of asbestos.

(ii) Risk management response

    - As regards capital expenditure, the Group has designed internal procedure to
assess risks related to capital expenditure projects and assess return of
investment. With the implementation of such capital expenditure projects, the
Group defines actions plan to ensure the new assets will be properly used under
formalized and detailed industrial processes as well as properly maintained.
Prevention plans are defined to mitigate identified risks and vulnerabilities.

    - To mitigate risks of obsolescence regular investments are made in modernization
and maintenance of industrial facilities.

    - Regarding safety, the Group has developed a strategy for safety based on 4
initiatives : i) provide safe equipment and work conditions for employees; ii)
eliminate risks using tools for detection, observations (JSA, Safety Walk for
managers), and risk identification (SUSA Cards, Take 5 for employees); iii)
implement operational discipline, positive recognition, and consequences
management; and iv) create conditions to guide teams towards a 'independent' or
even 'interdependent' safety culture (Bradley curve).

    - Industrial sites are continuously developing business continuity plans with the aim
to secure ability of the industrial sites to identify risks and define back up/mitigation
actions plan should a risk materialize.

    - With respect to capital expenditures in Halden plant and with the new laying vessel,
dedicated teams have been designed to ensure respectively a smooth ramp up of
the site extension to meet expected return on investment in due time (the same
process was implemented in relation with the capital expenditure made in
Charleston site). In addition, a robust planification and quality, health and safety
monitoring of the new laying vessel construction has been designed to meet
expected delivery date and technical specifications.

    - In relation with the environmental risk, the Group ensures that its manufacturing
sites have sufficient resources to identify and track regulatory requirements that
concern them, as well as changes in those regulations, and also that they have the
financial resources they need to ensure regulatory compliance. Environmental due
diligence Phase 1 or initial soil pollution diagnosis have been run in all its Nexans
sites. Environmental due diligence Phase are run by international recognized
specialized service providers.

    - In the meantime with respect to environmental risks, Nexans is leading on an
annual basis, a detailed survey to identify and define all potential risks and assess
the means of prevention for each. This risk assessment is based on a series of
steps, including i) the identification of risks, ii) the assessment of the risks criticality
and iii) the definition of potential complementary actions required to reduce the risk.
It also enable a better follow-up of the implementation of the defined mitigation
actions as well as of the assessment of the results. The above also participates to
the spread of risk culture within the operating entities and in particular to a proactive
industrial risk management across the Group.

25


-----

    - In relation with asbestos risk, monitoring to check compliance with local regulations
is lead under the responsibility of industrial business unit managers. In addition,
industrial business unit managers develop and keep up to date elimination plans.

**Risk related to contractual liability: product liability**


RISK RANKING

Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks

⚫ Financial impacts ⚫ Risks related to Claims and litigations

⚫ Risks related to turnkey projects


(i) Risk description

The manufacturing and commercial activities of the Group’s operating companies expose
them to potential product quality issues and possible claims for damage to property or third
parties allegedly caused by its products. In particular, supplying Group’s products to certain
sectors such as the automotive or the aerospace industries, could expose the Group’s
operating companies to possible product recalls or grounding campaigns as a result of
serial product defects that can affect a large number of vehicles or aircrafts.

Also, industry and market practices and trends have been evolving over the past years,
and customers push for longer product warranty periods, and more stringent contract
conditions (in particular related to liabilities). In the meantime, the warranties extended to
the Group’s various companies by their suppliers of materials and components used in
these companies’ products may remain shorter or be less extensive than the warranties
granted by the Group’s subsidiaries to their own customers (for example PVC materials
and others).

In some countries such as in South America and Europe (like in France and Italy), utilities
are imposing their terms and conditions whereby no limitation of liability is accepted for
some categories of cables. In the same spirit, in certain industries such as in the automotive
business, customers are imposing their terms and conditions with no limitation of liability.

(ii) Risk management response

To limit these risks related to product liability, the Group has developed the following control
systems:

    - all major contracts entered into by the Group’s operating subsidiaries are subject
to a systematic risk-assessment procedure and bids representing over 5 million
euros for businesses other than high-voltage business are submitted to a Group
Tender Review Committee. Particular focus is placed on ensuring that the Group’s
sales and technical teams (i) are able to pinpoint the risks inherent in sales
contracts and (ii) involve the Group’s Legal Department in contractual negotiations;

    - a sales contract policy aiming at limiting the overall liability exposure of the Group’s
operating companies towards their clients in case of occurrence of a contract
execution issue (such as delay, quality problem);

    - in order to mitigate product liability risk, the Group has set up stringent product
quality control procedures. The majority of its units are ISO 9001-certified. Many of

26


-----

them also hold certifications that are specific to their business (e.g. IRIS for rolling
stock, ISO 9100 for aerospace…). In addition, each unit tracks a set of indicators
on a monthly basis in order to assess progress made in terms of quality and
customer satisfaction. The Group currently has third party liability insurance that
covers product liability, which it considers to be in line with industry standards and
whose coverage amounts largely exceed any past claims. However, the Group
cannot guarantee that its insurance policies would provide sufficient coverage for
all forms of liability claims and if several entities suffer claims in the same year as
although the coverage amounts are high, they are capped at annual levels and the
policies contain standard exclusion clauses, notably concerning the cost of the
product itself and late-delivery penalties. The Group currently has third party liability

(i) Risk description

In late January 2009, the European Commission launched an antitrust investigation against
various cable manufacturers including Group companies in relation to alleged
anticompetitive behavior in the subsea and underground high-voltage power cables sector.
Several similar investigations were subsequently launched in other jurisdictions.

On 2 April 2014, the European Commission adopted a decision addressed inter alia to
Nexans France SAS and the Company (the “EC Decision”), which found that Nexans
France SAS had participated directly in an infringement of European antitrust legislation in
the subsea and underground high-voltage power cable sector. The Company was held
jointly liable for the payment of a portion of the fine imposed on Nexans France SAS by the
European Commission.

In early July 2014, Nexans France SAS paid the 70.6 million euro fine imposed on it by the
European Commission. Nexans France SAS and the Company appealed the EC Decision
to the General Court of the European Union. The appeal was dismissed on 12 July 2018.
Nexans France SAS and the Company appealed the General Court’s judgment before the
European Court of Justice, which, in turn, dismissed the appeal on 16 July 2020.

27


-----

In the period following the decision, several customers alleged they had suffered loss as a
result of the conduct subject of the EC Decision. However, only in around 2019, did certain
customers issue legal proceedings against Group entities claiming damages for alleged
losses. Most of these claims have been filed before the courts in the United Kingdom, Italy
and the Netherlands against Nexans and other defendants.

In the UK, Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) lodged a claim against the Company and
Nexans France SAS and certain companies of the Prysmian Group. In September 2019,
the claim against the Company and Nexans France SAS was discontinued, with no
payment to SSE and each party bearing their own costs of the proceedings.

Prysmian was one of the main defendants in certain antitrust damages claims initiated in
the UK by National Grid and Scottish Power in 2015. Contribution claims have been brought
by Prysmian against Nexans France SAS and the Company in these cases. Prysmian and
the other main defendants have now reached a settlement with National Grid and Scottish
Power.

In March 2017, Vattenfall initiated a claim for alleged antitrust damages against Prysmian
and NKT before the High Court in England. On 12 June 2020, Nexans France SAS and the
Company were notified of a contribution claim brought by Prysmian. Both the main claim
and the contribution claim were transferred from the High Court to the UK Competition
Tribunal (a specialist competition court).

Italian company Terna S.p.A. launched an antitrust damages claim in the Court of Milan.
Nexans Italia filed a defense on 24 October 2019 focusing on Nexans Italia’s lack of
standing to be sued. Following an initial hearing on 13 November 2019, the judge ruled
Terna’s claim to be null for lack of clarity on 3 February 2020. Terna supplemented its claim
on 11 May 2020. On 26 January 2021, the judge ruled that the decision on jurisdiction and
other preliminary issues will be rendered along with that on the merits. A hearing took place
on 4 May 2022, at which the parties discussed their evidentiary requests, in which all parties
restated the main arguments and evidentiary requests that they had previously raised. A
final outcome is expected in 2024.

The claim in the Netherlands was made jointly by Electricity & Water Authority of Bahrain,
GCC Interconnection Authority, Kuwait Ministry of Electricity and Water and Oman
Electricity Transmission Company, against certain companies of the Prysmian Group and
its former shareholders, and companies in the Nexans Group and ABB Groups. This action
has been brought before the District Court of Amsterdam. On 18 December 2019, Nexans
and other defendants filed a motion contesting jurisdiction. The court issued its judgment
on 25 November 2020, declaring itself incompetent with regard to the claims against the
non-Dutch defendants, including certain Group entities. The court also ordered the
claimants to pay the costs of the proceedings. The claimants appealed this ruling and the
case on the merits against the Dutch defendants is stayed pending the appeal judgment.
The Dutch courts are considering whether to refer certain questions to the European Court
of Justice (ECJ) for a ruling, which would delay the hearing of the substantive issues in the
Netherlands by at least two years. On 19 September 2023, the Amsterdam Court of Appeal
made a preliminary reference to the ECJ on issues relating to the jurisdiction of the Dutch
courts. The referral judgment means that the main proceedings before the Dutch courts are
suspended pending the ECJ’s ruling Investigations carried out by the American, Japanese,
New Zealand and Canadian authorities in the high-voltage power cable sector were closed
without sanctions. During investigations led by the Australian antitrust authority (ACCC),
the Australian courts dismissed ACCC’s case and refused to sanction Nexans and its

Australian subsidiary in the high-voltage power cable sector in a case pertaining to the sale
of low- and medium- voltage cables.

An investigation in Brazil by the General Superintendence of the antitrust authority “CADE”
in the high-voltage power cable sector was concluded on 11 February 2019. On 15 April
2020 the Administrative Tribunal of CADE condemned the Company, together with other
cable manufacturers. Nexans has paid the 1 million euro (BRL equivalent) fine and has
appealed the decision. The case is ongoing.

An investigation by the antitrust authority in South Korea (“KFTC”) in the high-voltage
power cable sector has not been officially closed but Nexans understands that the relevant
limitation periods should be considered expired.

Nexans’ local Korean subsidiaries have cooperated with the KFTC in investigations initiated
between 2013 and 2015 in businesses other than the high-voltage. As a result, full leniency
(zero fine) was granted by KFTC in 15 cases, and for two other cases the Nexans Korean
subsidiaries were granted a 20% reduction on the fines imposed and were ordered to pay
the KFTC a total of approx. 850,000 euros. All such investigations are now closed, and the
risks associated with the majority of claims brought by customers in connection with them
are now all concluded.

On 24 November 2017 in Spain, Nexans Iberia and the Company (in its capacity as Nexans
Iberia’s parent company) were notified of a decision by the Spanish competition authority
(“CNMC”), which found that Nexans Iberia had participated directly in an infringement of
Spanish competition laws in the low- and medium-voltage cable sectors. The Company
was held jointly liable for the payment of part of the fine levied on Nexans Iberia by the
CNMC. In early January 2018, Nexans Iberia settled the 1.3 million euro fine levied by the
CNMC. Nexans Iberia and the Company have appealed the CNMC’s decision. Appeal
decision is expected in 2023.

On 27 July 2020, Nexans Iberia was served with a claim filed by Iberdrola before the
Commerce Court of Barcelona, on the basis on the CNMC’s decision (which also
sanctioned one of Iberdrola’s subsidiaries). Iberdrola is seeking a total of 9.4 million euros
in damages from the defendants, including Prysmian and several local Spanish producers.
Nexans filed preliminary defense arguments and the case is pending.

On 20 January and 10 May 2022, the German Federal Cartel Office (FCO) carried out
searches at three of Nexans’ sites in Germany. The searches are part of an investigation
on cable manufacturers concerning alleged coordination of industry-standard metal
surcharges in Germany. The FCO also conducted inspections at the premises of other
companies in Germany. Nexans successfully challenged the validity of the searches at its
premises. However, the investigation is still ongoing and on 20 February 2024, the FCO
carried out searches at another Nexans site in Germany.

In May 2022, an application for a “collective proceedings order” was made in the UK,
seeking approval to bring an opt-out claim on behalf of millions of UK consumers (as well
as an opt-in claim for non-UK domiciled customers who paid for electricity in the UK). This
case is at a very early stage and a hearing on certification is expected to take place in 2024
which, if granted, will lead to lengthy proceedings over the next few years.

On 8 July 2022, London Array Limited and other participants in the London Array
consortium commenced a claim in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal for antitrust
damages in relation to the EC Decision. The Company and Nexans France are the
defendants in this claim. The claim is ongoing.

29


-----

As of 31 December 2022, and following a reassessment of risks in July 2022, the Group
has a recorded contingency provision of 66.5 million euros to cover all the investigations
mentioned above as well as the direct and indirect consequences of the related rulings that
have been or will be handed down and in particular the follow-on damages claims by
customers (existing or potential claims). The amount of the provision is based on
management’s assumptions that take into account the consequences in similar cases and
currently available information. There is still considerable uncertainty as to the extent of the
risks related to potential claims and/or fines. The final costs related to these risks could
therefore be significantly different from the amount of the provision recognized.

The Group’s risk prevention systems and compliance program have been strengthened
regularly and significantly in recent years and are at the core of the Group continuous
improvement efforts. However, the Group cannot guarantee that all risks and problems
relating to practices that do not comply with the applicable rules of ethics and business
conduct will be fully controlled or eliminated. As consistently communicated by the
Company in the past, unfavorable outcomes for antitrust proceedings and/or investigations
as well as the associated consequences could have a material adverse effect on the results
and thus the financial position of the Group.

(ii) Risk management response

Policy

As a complement to the section of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct dedicated to
fair competition, the Group’s Antitrust Guidelines provide guidance on the application of
basic competition law rules. The Antitrust Guidelines are applicable to all affiliates and
subsidiaries everywhere Nexans does business.

Training

All top executives, managers and key personnel throughout the Group must complete the
Compliance Week training every year. The training includes an antitrust section with test
questions based on realistic business cases.

In addition, more in-depth/spot trainings are conducted to most exposed positions (sales &
purchasing managers as well as members of a Trade association) and/or when a specific
issue is identified.

Specific mitigation measures subsequent to the risk mapping

The Group has integrated all competition law aspects to the compliance risk mapping
carried out pursuant to the “Sapin II” legislation.

These antitrust risks identified are managed through centrally monitored mitigation and
remediation measures, including the use of dedicated digital tools which facilitate second
and third level control.

Whistleblowing

Employees are encouraged, through internal communication and trainings, to use the
Group’s incident report system to raise concerns including about any breach of business
ethics and anticorruption rules, whether within Nexans or by business partners.

The incident report system is also available, in 17 languages, to anyone outside the Group,
by phone, through an application, or remotely through the website www.nexans.com. In

    - the Gifts and Hospitality Policy, also governing invitations, charity and donations;

    - the Conflicts of Interests Policy explaining how to identify, disclose and manage
potential and actual conflict of interest situations;

    - the Tender Review and Contract Risk Management Policy ensures that sales offers,
bids, quotations submitted or sales contracts signed by all Nexans subsidiaries are
compliant with the Group ground rules, notably the Corruption Prevention Policy;

31


-----

- the Charter for Responsible Public Advocacy issued end of 2021 which lays down
the main commitments applicable to all Nexans employees and in particular those
in charge of public advocacy activities.

These Guidelines are applicable to all affiliates and subsidiaries, everywhere Nexans does
business.

Training

Nexans has developed a 3 year strategy regarding compliance trainings and has identified
key categories of population: (i) online strategy and (ii) offline strategy.

For online trainings, yearly all employees with a Nexans e-mail address – hence top
executives, managers and key personnel as well as administrators – are invited to complete
compliance e-learnings launched during the annual Compliance Week. These courses are
robust trainings on anti-bribery and corruption, conflict of interests, gifts and hospitalities,
sponsorship and donations or trade sanctions. The courses may also include reminders on
Human Rights, Inclusion & Diversity, Data Privacy or Cybersecurity governing principles.

New joiners are also assigned to the recently developed “Living the Code of Ethics at
Nexans” course when joining the Group, to ensure full understanding and adherence to
Nexans working principles.

For offline strategy, colleagues working on lines and all over the globe must receive the
“Living the Code of Ethics at Nexans”, adapted for face-to-face, course.

In addition, high exposure employees as identified by Business Groups in key functions
must conduct more in-depth trainings face-to-face. Over a three year period, high exposure
employees must therefore follow anti-bribery and corruption, antitrust and trade sanctions
trainings.

It has to be stressed that face-to-face trainings can occur as a mitigation measure when a
specific issue is identified.

Specific mitigation measures

As part of its continuous improvement process, the Group is currently further enhancing
the anti-bribery and corruption risk mapping. A fully digitalized exercise has been launched
in 2023 across the Group. This exercise will further allow the Group to ensure robustness
of its process to mitigate risk adequately.

As an example, through past risk mapping exercise conducted by the Group, sales
representatives were identified as representing a potential anti-bribery and corruption risk.
Specific risk mitigation activities, including specific due diligence, have been introduced
through a dedicated online platform, enabling the Group to have a centralized tool to
mitigate risk that sales intermediaries could represent.

In addition, all relevant employees who find themselves in a potential conflict of interest
situation or are politically exposed have an obligation to disclose their situation through a
centralized and automated digital tool. The system allows a harmonized management of
cases, facilitating second and third level controls.

Furthermore, managers, similarly to new joiners, must sign a compliance certificate
pledging to comply with Nexans’ Code of Ethics and Business Conduct.

32


-----

The Group also performs compliance due diligence in the framework of contemplated
Merger and Acquisitions transactions so as to be able to identify compliance issues with
potential acquisition targets early on.

Finally, in 2023, the Group has further defined its vigilance plan which includes a
strengthened compliance due diligence for the categories of purchasers identified as most
at risk.

Whistleblowing

Employees are encouraged, through internal communication and trainings, to use the
Group’s incident report system to raise concerns about any breach of business ethics and
anticorruption rules, whether within Nexans or by business partners.

The incident report system is also available, in 17 languages, to anyone outside the Group,
by phone, through an application, or remotely through the website www.nexans.com. In
addition, a simple search “Nexans alert” on any Internet search engine will direct to the
incident report system portal.

Internal controls and internal audit

The implementation of the Group Compliance Program is audited regularly by the Internal
Audit Team to ensure robustness of controls. The Group Audit Department also controls
compliance with anticorruption rules in the framework of the regular audits of operational
entities and performs missions specifically dedicated to anticorruption issues.

**(d)** **Financial risks**

This paragraph entitled “Financial risks” should be read in conjunction with Note 27 “Financial risks”
to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements, which also sets out a sensitivity analysis for 2022.

Please also refer to Note 1.F.c to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements as well as Note 7
“Net asset impairment”, which sets out the assumptions used for the purpose of impairment testing.

**Metal price and hedging risk**


RISK RANKING


Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks

⚫ Financial impact on EBITDA and financial results ⚫ None

(i) Risk description

The nature of the Group’s business activities exposes it to volatility in non-ferrous metal
prices (copper and, to a lesser extent, aluminum and lead) as non-ferrous metal represent
a significative portion of the cables. For illustration purposes, during the last years 2022
and 2023, the price of copper has been subject to high volatility in a range of 3,000 USD/ton
between the lowest and the highest prices. With respect to aluminum and lead, the Group
may face lack of liquidity to secure a long term hedging.

Besides, for the sake of illustration, at the end of 2021, the low liquidity on the futures
markets for metals generated high volatility on forward quotations and on the renewal of

33


-----

hedges. This phenomenon was probably linked to an increase in the demand. It is currently
difficult to know whether this level of liquidity is a cyclical or structural phenomenon.

In the recent years, numerous banks exited the metal market as it mobilized too many
resources compared to the level of risk. In 2022, new players strengthened their capacity
to offer commodity hedges allowing the Nexans Group to secure access to the metal
derivatives market.

(ii) Risk management response

In line with general practice in the cable industry, the policy of the Group’s operating
subsidiaries concerned is to pass on metal prices in their own selling prices and to hedge
the related risk either through a natural hedge or by entering into futures contracts on metal
exchange market. In addition, a dedicated team at Group level is fully monitoring the risk
of volatility of non-ferrous metal prices.

Despite this general policy, the Group remains exposed to non-ferrous metal price volatility
risk due to the nature of activities of the Group (such as long-term contracts…).

In that respect, the Group’s strategy for managing non-ferrous metal price risks, the
potential impact of fluctuations in copper prices and the hedges put in place are described
in Notes 27.C and 27.E to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements.

Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks

⚫ Financial impact on EBITDA and financial results ⚫ None

(i) Risk description

Main part external debts (bonds, EIB) approximately 800 million euros are on fix rates.
Recent evolution of the economic environment (inflation and interests rates hikes) will have
an impact on Group structure financing. A sensitivity analysis concerning changes in
interest rates is provided in Note 27.E to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements.

(ii) Risk management response

This risk is monitored closing by the Group Treasury and Metal Direction with a regular
update to Group CFO during the monthly Financing Committee.

The renewal of long term debts will be done through fixed debt (bond or loans) in order to
have a limited percentage of gross debt with floating interest rates.

(i) Risk description

The Group’s main liquidity risk relates to:

    - its obligation to repay or redeem its existing debt, primarily corresponding to (i) one
issue of bond maturing in 2024, (ii) trade receivables securitization programs used
within the Group, (iii) to a lesser extent, short-term debt taken out by a number of
the Group’s subsidiaries and (iv) commercial papers programs (NEU CP); and

    - the Group’s future financing requirements (including working capital fluctuations).

(ii) Risk management response

To mitigate the liquidity risk of the Group, the Group has:

    - extended the maturity of Nexans syndicated loan signed on 26 October 2022 (for
an amount of 800 million euros – see Note 27.A to the 2023 Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details) to October 2028 and for an amount of 800 million
euros; and

    - a commercial papers program for an amount up to 600 million euros (see Note 27.A
to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements for further details);

Details of the Group’s cash requirements and resources (especially cash surpluses and
credit facilities), together with its policy for managing and monitoring liquidity are described
in Note 27 to the 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements.

**Currency risk**


RISK RANKING


Potential effects for the Group Main correlated Risks

⚫ Financial impact on EBITDA and financial results ⚫ None

(i) Risk description

The foreign exchange risk to which the Group is exposed is described in Note 27.C to the
2023 Consolidated Financial Statements. Apart from in relation to non-ferrous metal
transactions, the Group considers its exposure to foreign exchange risk on operating cash
flows to be limited for the Group as a whole, due to its underlying operational structure
whereby most subsidiaries primarily operate in their domestic markets, with the main
exception being export contracts in the high-voltage business.

On account of its international presence, the Group is also exposed to foreign currency
translation risk on the net assets of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the
euro. It is Group policy not to hedge these risks.

(ii) Risk management response

Currency hedges are set up by a dedicated team of the Group in order for operating units’
cash flows to remain denominated in their functional currency. This is notably the case for
the Group’s subsidiaries in Brazil (BRL vs USD), Canada (CAD vs USD), Norway (NOK vs
EUR, GBP, JPY and USD), Switzerland (CHF vs EUR) and Turkey (TRY vs EUR, USD).

A sensitivity analysis concerning fluctuations in the two main currencies that present a
foreign exchange risk for the Group (the US dollar and the Norwegian krone) is provided in
Note 27.E.

## 2 RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE NOTES

**(a)** **Risks related to particular structure of the Notes**

**Credit Risk**

As contemplated by Condition 2, the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and
(subject to the provisions of Condition 3) unsecured obligations of the Issuer. However, an
investment in the Notes involves taking credit risk on the Issuer. Credit risk refers to the risk that
the Issuer may be unable to meet its financial obligations under the Notes. If the creditworthiness
of the Issuer deteriorates and notwithstanding Condition 9 which enables the Noteholders to
request through the Representative of the Masse the redemption of the Notes, it may not be able
to fulfil all or part of its payment obligations under the Notes, which could materially and negatively
impact the Noteholders, who may lose all or part of their investment.

**The Notes are not protected by restrictive covenants and do not prevent the Issuer from**
**incurring additional indebtedness**

The negative pledge provided in Condition 3 prohibits the Issuer from granting any mortgage over
its present or future real property assets or interests, nor any pledge, charge, or any other security
interest on its present or future assets or incomes, to holders of other notes (obligations) issued or
guaranteed by the Issuer, which are, or are capable of being, admitted to trading on a regulated
market.

Subject to this negative pledge, the Issuer may incur significant additional indebtedness that could
rank equally with the Notes. Accordingly, if the Issuer incurs significant additional indebtedness
ranking equally with the Notes, it will increase the number of claims that would be entitled to share
rateably with Noteholders in any proceeds distributed in connection with an insolvency, bankruptcy
or similar proceeding and increase the risk for the Noteholders to lose all or part of their investment
in the Notes.

**The Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity**

In the event that the Issuer would be obliged to pay additional amounts in respect of any Notes due
to any withholding as provided in Condition 7 or in the case of an event of default as provided in
Condition 9, the Issuer may and, in certain circumstances shall, redeem all, but not some only, of
the Notes then outstanding at their then outstanding principal amount together with any interest
accrued in accordance with Condition 5(b) and such Conditions.

In addition, subject to the conditions set out in Condition 5(c), on any Make-Whole Redemption
Date, the Issuer may redeem all, or a specified percentage of, the outstanding principal amount of
the Notes as calculated in such Condition 5(c). Depending on the aggregate nominal amount of
Notes so redeemed, any trading market in respect of the Notes may become illiquid. As a result, a
Noteholder may not be able to resell its Notes without incurring a significant discount from the
nominal value of the Notes.

Furthermore, the Issuer may at its option redeem the Notes in whole (but not in part) at their
outstanding principal amount together with any interest accrued up to (but excluding) the date fixed
for redemption during the period from, and including, [the date falling three (3) months] to, but
excluding, the Maturity Date, as provided in Condition 5(d).

36


-----

If 75 per cent. or more in initial principal amount of the Notes have been redeemed or purchased
and cancelled, the Issuer may, on not less than 15 or more than 45 calendar days' notice to the
Noteholders, redeem all the remaining Notes at their then outstanding principal amount together
with any accrued interest as set out in Condition 5(e).

Any early redemption of the Notes may result, for the Noteholders, in a yield that is considerably
lower than anticipated. In addition, Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the moneys they
receive upon such early redemption in securities with the same yield as the redeemed Notes.

**Change of Control – Put Option**

Condition 8 provides that in the event of a Put Event, the holder of each Note will have the option
to require the Issuer to redeem or procure the purchase of that Note at its then outstanding principal
amount together with any accrued interest. Furthermore, if a potential Change of Control and a
Rating Downgrade in respect of such potential Change of Control Period occur, a holder of Notes
will not be able to exercise its Put Option unless within 180 calendar days following the date of
such announcement or statement relating to any potential Change of Control, a Change of Control
occurs. Any trading market in respect of those Notes in respect of which such Put Option is not
exercised may become illiquid. In addition, Noteholders may not be able to reinvest the moneys
they receive upon such early redemption in securities with the same yield as the redeemed Notes.
Therefore, Noteholders not having exercised their Put Options may not be able to sell their Notes
on the market and may have to wait until the Maturity Date to obtain redemption of their investments
in the Notes, which may reduce the profits anticipated by the Noteholders at the time of the issue.

**Interest rate risks**

The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from time to time at the rate of [●]
per cent. per annum, from, and including, the Issue Date to (but excluding) the Maturity Date and
will be payable in Euro annually in arrear on [●] in each year, commencing on [●], in accordance
with Condition 4. Investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market
interest rates may adversely affect the value and the yield of the Notes and Noteholders may
receive lower return on the Notes than anticipated at the time of the issue and lose a portion of the
capital invested if they decide to sell their Notes.

**(b)** **Risk related to legislation**

**French Insolvency Law**

The Issuer is a _société anonyme with its corporate seat in France. In the event that the Issuer_
becomes insolvent, insolvency proceedings will be generally governed by the insolvency laws of
France to the extent that, where applicable, the "centre of main interests" (as construed under
Regulation (EU) 2015/848, as amended) of the Issuer is located in France.

The Directive (EU) 2019/1023 on preventive restructuring frameworks, on discharge of debt and
disqualifications, and on measures to increase the efficiency of procedures concerning
restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt, and amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 has been
transposed into French law by the _Ordonnance 2021-1193 dated 15 September 2021. Such_
_ordonnance, applicable as from 1[st] October 2021, amends French insolvency laws notably with_
regard to the process of adoption of restructuring plans under insolvency proceedings. According
to this ordonnance, "affected parties" (including notably creditors, and therefore the Noteholders)
shall be treated in separate classes which reflect certain class formation criteria for the purpose of
adopting a restructuring plan. Classes shall be formed in such a way that each class comprises
claims or interests with rights that reflect a sufficient commonality of interest based on verifiable
criteria. Noteholders will no longer deliberate on the proposed restructuring plan in a separate

37


-----

assembly, meaning that they will no longer benefit from a specific veto power on this plan. Instead,
as any other affected parties, the Noteholders will be grouped into one or several classes (with
potentially other types of creditors) and their dissenting vote may possibly be overridden by a crossclass cram down.

The commencement of insolvency proceedings against the Issuer would have a material adverse
effect on the market value of notes issued by the Issuer, including the Notes. As a consequence,
any decisions taken by a class of affected parties could negatively and significantly impact the
Noteholders and cause them to lose all or part of their investment, should they not be able to
recover all or part of the amounts due to them from the Issuer.

**Modification of the Terms and Conditions of the Notes**

Holders of Notes will be grouped automatically for the defense of their common interests in a
_Masse, as defined in Condition 11, and a General Assembly of Noteholders can be held_ or a Written
Resolution can be taken. The Terms and Conditions of the Notes permit in certain cases defined
majorities to bind all Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant General Assembly or
did not consent to the relevant Written Resolution and Noteholders who voted in a manner contrary
to the majority. If a decision is adopted by a majority of Noteholders and such modifications were
to impair or limit the rights of the Noteholders, this may have a negative impact on the market value
of the Notes and hence Noteholders may lose part of their investment.

The Noteholders may, subject to the provisions of Condition 11 and the limitation provided by
French law, deliberate on any proposal relating to the modification of the Terms and Conditions of
the Notes, notably on any proposal, whether for arbitration or settlement, relating to rights in
controversy or which were subject of judicial decisions.

Condition 11 provides that the provisions of Article L.228-65 I. 1° and 4° of the French Code de
_commerce (respectively providing for a prior approval of the General Meeting of any change in_
corporate purpose or form of the Issuer, or of an issue of notes benefiting from a security (sûreté
_réelle) which does not benefit to the_ _Masse) and the related provisions of the French_ _Code de_
_commerce shall not apply to the Notes. As a result of these exclusions, the prior approval of the_
Noteholders will not have to be obtained on any such matters which may affect their interests
generally.

**(c)** **Risks related to the market generally**

**Market Value of the Notes**

The Notes [are expected to be/have been] rated [●] by S&P. The market value of the Notes will be
affected by the creditworthiness of the Issuer and a number of additional factors, including, but not
limited to, market interest and yield rates and the time remaining to the maturity date. The value of
the Notes depends on a number of interrelated factors, including economic, financial and political
events in France or elsewhere, including factors affecting capital markets generally and the stock
exchanges on which the Notes are traded. The price at which a Noteholder will be able to sell the
Notes prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be substantial, from the issue price or
the purchase price paid by such Noteholder. Accordingly, all or part of the capital invested by the
Noteholder may be lost upon any transfer of the Notes, so that the Noteholder in such case would
receive significantly less than the total amount of capital invested.

**No active secondary or trading market for the Notes**

Application has been made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris as from the
Issue Date. An active trading market for the Notes may not develop and, if one does develop, it
may not be maintained. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop or is not

38


-----

maintained, the market or trading price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected.
Therefore, Noteholders may not be able to sell their Notes in the secondary market (in which case
the market or trading price and liquidity may be adversely affected) or may not be able to sell their
Notes at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a
developed secondary market and Noteholders could lose a significant part of their investments in
the Notes.

In addition, exercise of the Put Option, as defined and provided in Condition 8 in respect of any
Notes may affect the liquidity of the Notes in respect of which such Put Option is not exercised.
Depending on the number of Notes in respect of which the Put Option is exercised, any trading
market in respect of any outstanding Notes may become to varying degrees less liquid.

**TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES**

The issue of the EUR [●] [●] per cent. Notes due [●] (the "Notes") by Nexans (the "Issuer") has been
authorised pursuant to the resolution of the Board of Directors (Conseil d’administration) of the Issuer
dated [●] 2024 and was decided by [Mr Christopher Guérin, Chief Executive Officer (Directeur général)] of
the Issuer on [●] 2024. The Issuer entered into an agency agreement dated [●] 2024 (the "Agency
**Agreement") with Société Générale as fiscal agent, paying agent and calculation agent (the "Fiscal**
**Agent", the "Paying Agent" and the "Calculation Agent", which expressions shall, where the context so**
admits, include any successor for the time being as fiscal agent and/or paying agent and/or calculation
agent) and as put agent (the "Put Agent", which expression shall, where the context so admits, include
any successor for the time being as put agent). References below to "Conditions" are, unless the context
otherwise requires, to the numbered paragraphs below. In these Conditions, "holder of Notes", "holder
**of any Note" or "Noteholder" means the person whose name appears in the account of the relevant**
Account Holder as being entitled to such Notes.

## 1 Form, Denomination and Title

The Notes are issued in dematerialised bearer form (au porteur) in the denomination of EUR
100,000 each. Title to the Notes will be evidenced in accordance with Article L.211-3 et seq. and
R.211-1 et seq.of the French Code monétaire et financier by book entries (inscription en compte).
No physical document of title (including certificats représentatifs pursuant to Article R.211-7 of the
French Code monétaire et financier) will be issued in respect of the Notes.

The Notes will, upon issue, be inscribed in the books of Euroclear France, which shall credit the
accounts of the Account Holders. For the purpose of these Conditions, "Account Holders" shall
mean any authorised financial intermediary institution entitled to hold, directly or indirectly,
accounts on behalf of its customers with Euroclear France, and includes Euroclear Bank SA/NV
("Euroclear") and the depositary bank for Clearstream Banking, S.A. ("Clearstream").

Title to the Notes shall be evidenced by entries in the books of Account Holders and will pass upon,
and transfer of Notes may only be effected through, registration of the transfer in such books.

## 2 Status 

The principal and interest in respect of the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated
and (subject to the provisions of Condition 3) unsecured obligations of the Issuer and rank and will
at all times rank _pari passu_ without any preference among themselves and (subject to such
exceptions as are from time to time mandatory under French law) equally and rateably with any
other present or future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer.

## 3 Negative Pledge

So long as any of the Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer undertakes not to grant any mortgage
(hypothèque) over its present or future real property assets or interests, nor any pledge
(nantissement), charge (gage), or any other security interest (sûreté réelle) on its present or future
assets or incomes, to holders of other notes (obligations) issued or guaranteed by the Issuer, which
are, or are capable of being, admitted to trading on a regulated market, unless at the same time
the Notes are equally and rateably secured therewith.

Such undertaking is given only in relation to security interests given for the benefit of holders of
notes (obligations) which are, or are capable of being, admitted to trading on a regulated market
and does not affect in any way the right of the Issuer to dispose of its assets or to grant any security
in respect of such assets in any other circumstance.

48


-----

For the purposes of these Conditions, "outstanding" means, in relation to the Notes, all the Notes
issued other than: (a) those which have been redeemed on their due date or otherwise in
accordance with the Conditions, (b) those in respect of which the date for redemption in accordance
with the Conditions has occurred and the redemption monies (including all interest accrued on such
Notes to the date for such redemption and any interest payable under Condition 4 after such date)
have been duly paid to the Fiscal Agent, (c) those which have been purchased and cancelled as
provided in Condition 5 and (d) those in respect of which claims have become prescribed under
Condition 10.

## 4 Interest

**(a)** **Rate of Interest**

The Notes will bear interest from, and including, [●] 2024 (the "Issue Date") to, but
excluding, [●] (the "Maturity Date"), at the rate of [●] per cent. per annum payable annually
in arrear on [●] in each year (each an "Interest Payment Date") commencing on [●]. [There
will be a [short/long] first coupon in respect of the period from, and including, the Issue Date
to, but excluding, [●] which will amount to EUR [●] per Note of EUR 100,000 denomination.]

The period from, and including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, the first Interest Payment
Date and each successive period from and including an Interest Payment Date to, but
excluding, the next Interest Payment Date is called an "Interest Period".

**(b)** **Interest Calculation**

Where interest is to be calculated in respect of a period which is equal to or shorter than
an Interest Period (as defined under Condition 4(a) above), the day-count fraction used will
be the Actual/Actual-ICMA method being the number of calendar days in the relevant
period, from and including the date from which interest begins to accrue to but excluding
the date on which it falls due, divided by the number of calendar days in the Interest Period
in which the relevant period falls (including the first such day but excluding the last).

**(c)** **Interest Accrual**

Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption, unless payment of
the full amount due in respect of the Notes is improperly withheld or refused on such date.
In such event, interest on the outstanding principal amount of such Note from time to time
shall continue to accrue at such rate until, and including, whichever is the earlier of (i) the
day on which all sums due in respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on
behalf of the relevant Noteholder and (ii) the day of receipt by or on behalf of Euroclear
France of all sums due in respect of all the Notes.

## 5 Redemption and Purchase

The Notes may not be redeemed or purchased and cancelled otherwise than in accordance with
Conditions 5, 8 and 9.

Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as provided below, the Notes will
be redeemed by the Issuer at their outstanding principal amount on the Maturity Date.

political subdivision or authority therein or thereof having power to tax, or any
change in the official application or interpretation of such law or regulation (including
a holding by a competent court), becoming effective after the Issue Date, the Issuer
would, on the occasion of the next payment of principal or interest due in respect
of the Notes, not be able to make such payment without having to pay additional
amounts as specified in Condition 7, the Issuer may, at its sole discretion, at any
time, subject to having given not more than 45 nor less than 15 calendar days' prior
notice to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (which notice shall be
irrevocable), redeem in whole, but not in part, the Notes outstanding at their
outstanding principal amount, together with all interest accrued to the date fixed for
redemption, provided that the due date for redemption of which notice hereunder
may be given shall be no earlier than the latest practicable date on which the Issuer
could make payment of principal or interest without withholding for French taxes.

(ii) If the Issuer would on the next payment of principal or interest in respect of the
Notes be prevented by French law from making payment to the Noteholders of the
full amount then due and payable, notwithstanding the undertaking to pay additional
amounts contained in Condition 7, then the Issuer shall forthwith give notice of such
fact to the Fiscal Agent and the Issuer shall, subject to having given not less than
7 (seven) calendar days' prior notice to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 12 (which notice shall be irrevocable), redeem in whole, but not in part,
the Notes at their outstanding principal amount, together with all interest accrued
to the date fixed for redemption of which notice hereunder may be given, provided
that the due date for redemption shall be no earlier than the latest practicable date
on which the Issuer could make payment of the full amount of principal or interest,
payable in respect of the Notes or, if such date has passed, as soon as practicable
thereafter.

**(c)** **Make-whole redemption at the option of the Issuer**

the latest on the business day in Paris and Frankfurt immediately succeeding the
Determination Date, the mid-market Bloomberg Generic Price (or any successor thereto)
for the Reference Benchmark Security at 11.00 am (Central European Time (CET)) (or, if
no such price is available at 11.00 am, the mid-market Bloomberg Generic Price (or any
successor thereto) which is next available on such date) as appearing on Bloomberg page

financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities of comparable maturity
to [3 months before the Maturity Date], or (ii) (where (i) does not apply) has the maturity

**(g)** **Cancellation**

All Notes which are redeemed or purchased for cancellation by, or on behalf of, the Issuer
pursuant to this Condition 5 will forthwith be cancelled (together with rights to interest any
other amounts relating thereto).

Any Notes so cancelled may not be resold and the obligations of the Issuer in respect of
any such Notes shall be discharged.

**(h)** **Partial redemption**

In the case of a partial redemption of the Notes in accordance with Condition 5(c), such
redemption will be effected by reducing the principal amount of each Note on such date in

Noteholders to the Account Holders and all payments made to such Account Holders in
favour of Noteholders will be an effective discharge of the Issuer and the Fiscal Agent, as
the case may be, in respect of such payment.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts in respect of the Notes will be made

**(b)** **Payments on Business Days**

If any due date for payment of any amount of principal or interest, in respect of any Note
is not a Business Day (as defined below), payment shall not be made of the amount due

## 7 Taxation

**(a)** **Withholding Tax Exemption**

Issuer in respect of the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding or
deduction for or on account of, any taxes or duties of whatever nature imposed, levied or
collected by or on behalf of France or any authority therein or thereof having power to tax,
unless such withholding or deduction is required by law.

**(b)** **Additional Amounts**

If French law or regulation should require that payments of principal of, or interest on, any
of the Notes be subject to deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or
future taxes or duties of whatever nature, the Issuer shall, to the extent permitted by law,
pay such additional amounts as will result in the receipt by the Noteholders of the amounts
which would have been receivable by them in the absence of such requirement to deduct
or withhold; provided, however, that the provisions mentioned above shall not apply to
payment of interests and other revenues to, or to a third party on behalf of, a Noteholder,
in respect of such Notes which are subject to taxes by reason of his having some
connection with France other than the mere holding of such Notes.

## 8 Change of Control

If at any time while any Note remains outstanding there occurs a Put Event, the holder of each
Note will have the option (the "Put Option") (unless, prior to the giving of the Put Event Notice (as

Issuer to redeem or, at the Issuer's option, to procure the purchase of that Note on the Optional
Redemption Date (as defined below) at its principal amount together with any interest accrued to,
but excluding the date set for redemption.

A "Put Event" shall be deemed to have occurred at each time (i) a Change of Control occurs and
(ii) within the Change of Control Period a Rating Downgrade occurs in respect of that Change of
Control or, as the case may be, potential Change of Control.

A "Change of Control" in respect of the Issuer shall be deemed to have occurred at each time
(whether or not approved by the Issuer) that any Relevant Person(s), at any time following the
Issue Date of the Notes, acquire(s) Control of the Issuer unless such Relevant Person(s) is (are)
under the Control of Nexans immediately prior to such Change of Control.

of such entity where no other shareholder of such entity, directly or indirectly, acting alone
or in concert with others, holds a number of shares carrying a percentage of the voting
rights exercisable in such general meetings which is higher than the percentage of voting
rights attached to the number of shares held by such Relevant Person.

A "Rating Downgrade" shall be deemed to have occurred in respect of a Change of Control if:

(i) within the Change of Control Period:

(a) any investment grade credit rating (Baa3/BBB-, or equivalent, or better) assigned
to the long-term debt of the Issuer by any Rating Agency is (x) either downgraded
to a non-investment grade credit rating (Ba1/BB+, or equivalent, or worse) or
withdrawn and (y) is not within the Change of Control Period subsequently (in the
case of a downgrade) upgraded or (in the case of a withdrawal) reinstated to an
investment grade credit rating by such Rating Agency; or

(b) any non-investment grade credit rating (Ba1/BB+, or equivalent, or worse) assigned
to the long-term debt of the Issuer by any Rating Agency is (x) downgraded by one
or more notches (for illustration, Ba1/BB+ to Ba2/BB being one notch) or withdrawn
and (y) is not within the Change of Control Period subsequently (in the case of a
downgrade) upgraded or (in the case of a withdrawal) reinstated to its earlier credit
rating or better by such Rating Agency; or

(c) the long-term debt of the Issuer has no credit rating, and no Rating Agency assigns
within the Change of Control Period an investment grade credit rating to the Notes,

provided that if on the Relevant Announcement Date the long-term debt of the Issuer is
assigned a credit rating from more than one Rating Agency, at least one of which is
investment grade, then sub-paragraph (a) will apply; and

(ii) in making the relevant decision(s) referred to (a) and (b) above, the relevant Rating Agency
announces publicly or confirms in writing to the Issuer that such decision(s) resulted
directly, in whole or to a significant degree, from the occurrence of the Change of Control
or, as the case may be, potential Change of Control,

_provided that if the rating designations employed by any Rating Agency are changed from_
those in force at the time of the Issue Date, the Issuer shall determine the rating
designations of such Rating Agency as are most equivalent to the prior rating
designations of such Rating Agency and this Condition 8 shall (in the absence of manifest
error) be read accordingly.

"Rating Agencies" means S&P Global Ratings, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
and/or Moody's Investor Services and/or Fitch Ratings and their respective successors or affiliates

Usage) declined by -1.5% organically reflecting (i) the exit from the Umbilical activity in the Generation &
Transmission segment, (ii) the focus on profitability and product mix toward higher value-added solutions
despite some normalization in the Usage segment, and (iii) excellent momentum in the Distribution
segment on the back of buoyant utilities demand. The Non-electrification business was up +13.7%
reflecting new developments in Auto-harnesses, recovery in Aerospace and solid momentum in Mining,
while Other activities continued to be downsized by a strong -17.9% organically compared to 2022.

The scope effect included the positive contribution of two acquisitions in the Distribution and Usage
businesses, partly offset by the divestment of the Telecom Systems business, Aginode, finalized in October
2023. After successfully acquiring Centelsa in Colombia in 2022, and achieving over €12 million in
synergies one year ahead of schedule thanks to the SHIFT programs roll-out, Nexans is continuing its
strategy of expansion in Electrification markets. On April 26, 2023, the Group completed the acquisition of
Reka Cables in Finland. Nexans anticipates €11 million in recurring synergies after full ramp-up, meaning
+€4 million run-rate synergies to be delivered 6 to 12 months ahead of the initial plan. These two
acquisitions add €500 million current sales in Electrification and enhance Nexans' global portfolio in key
segments.

**Adjusted EBITDA reached €665 million in 2023, up by a strong +8.2% versus €616 million in 2022.**

**Adjusted EBITDA margin was strong at 10.2% versus 9.1% in 2022, supported by cable businesses and**
illustrating Nexans’ value-driven model and embedded focus on performance. Electrification achieved a
record adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.5% in 2023 thanks to the product mix shift toward innovative, higher
value-added solutions, and structural profitability improvements in the Distribution and Usage segments,
more than offsetting the decline in the Generation & Transmission segment affected by one-offs in the first
half of the year.

In 2023, specific operating items included €13 million related to share-based payment expenses, and
€40 million in relation to additional costs on long-term projects impacted by past reorganizations. These
additional costs led to subsequent losses at completion which are not representative of the actual business
performance. In 2022, EBITDA included €16 million of specific operating items related to share-based
payment expenses.

**EBITDA (including share-based payment expenses) amounted to €652 million in 2023, above the**
guidance upgraded in July, versus €599 million in 2022.
**ROCE pursued its record-high trajectory, reaching 20.7% for the Group (20.5% in 2022), and 26.4% for**
the Electrification businesses.

**Operating margin totaled €432 million in 2023, representing 6.6% of sales at standard metal prices**
(versus 6.2% in 2022).

The Group ended 2023 with operating income of €374 million, compared with €395 million in 2022. The
main changes were as follows:

- **Reorganization costs amounted to €49 million in 2023 versus €39 million in 2022. In 2023, this**
amount mainly included costs for the on-going termination of Umbilical projects in Norway,
restructuring actions to implement a leaner organization, as well as costs related to new
transformation actions launched during the period.

- The core exposure effect was a negative €12 million in 2023 versus a negative €30 million in
2022.

- **Other operating income and expenses represented net income of €1 million in 2023, versus €46**
million in 2022, of which:

-----

    - **Net asset impairment for €23 million in 2023, versus zero in 2022. In 2023, the reversal**
of impairment was related to Australia and to the Amercable unit in the United States, both
on the back of the continued stronger performance.

    - **Net losses on asset disposals** amounted to €9 million in 2023, mainly related to the
disposal of the Telecom Systems business and of an equity investment. In 2022, the net
gain of €54 million was mainly related to the sale of the Hanover property in Germany.

The net financial expenses amounted to €(83) million in 2023, compared with €(57) million during the
same period last year. The decrease is mainly related to the higher cost of net debt, as well as a negative
currency impact.

**Income tax expense stood at €68 million, down from €90 million in 2022. The tax rate amounted to 18%**
of operating income in 2023 as a result of higher deferred tax assets recognition.

**Net income thus amounted to €223 million in 2023, versus €248 million in 2022, representing €5.1 per**
share.

**CASH FLOW AND NET DEBT AT 31 DECEMBER 2023**

**Normalized free cash flow grew by a strong 16% year-on-year to €454 million, in line with the Group’s**
solid operating performance and reflecting the strict management of working capital. Cash from operations
was a strong €511 million in 2023. Change in working capital amounted to €287 million on the back of high
Generation & Transmission project related advance payments. Thus, operating working capital
represented 0.3% of the Group’s annual sales at December 31, 2023 (2.7% at December 31, 2022), below
its normative level of ≤6%. The Normalized free cash flow also included a reorganization cash impact of
€98 million in 2023, up year-on-year, mainly due to a non-recurring loss at completion in a Generation &
Transmission project. Recurring capital expenditure amounted to €178 million (€141 million in 2022),
representing 2.7% of Group standard sales in 2023. Normalized free cash flow also included financial
interest for €73 million (€48 million in 2022), and other investing impacts for a negative €23 million (vs a
positive €13 million in 2022).

Calculated based on normalized free cash flow, the adjusted EBITDA to cash conversion rate was 68%.

**Free cash flow before M&A reached €234 million for the year (€271 million in 2022), and included**
strategic capital expenditure in the Generation & Transmission business of €199 million (€157 million in
2022), corresponding mainly to the expansion of the Halden plant in Norway, and the investment in a third
cable-laying vessel. Thus, for full-year 2023, total capital expenditure amounted to €377 million. On top of
strategic capital expenditure, the other items differing between normalized free cash flow and free cash
flow before M&A corresponded to Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible
assets of €6 million in 2023 (€60 million in 2022) and normative project tax cash-out for €28 million (€25
million in 2022).

Net cash flow from M&A amounted to a net outflow of €79 million in 2023 and mainly included the
acquisition of Reka Cables in Finland, as well as the divestment of Aginode. In 2022, this figure was a net
outflow of €255 million related to the acquisition of Centelsa.

Equity operations included the payment of the 2022 dividend of €2.10 per share for a total amount of €93
million, and share buybacks for €6 million. There was a net outflow of €87 million related to unfavorable
foreign exchange fluctuations and new leases liabilities.

**Net debt remained well under control at €214 million at December 31, 2023, from €182 million at December**
31, 2022, representing a 0.4x leverage ratio as per covenant definition[5].

The Board of Directors decided that, at the Annual General Meeting of May 16, 2024, it will recommend a
**dividend payment of €2.30 per share in respect of 2023, a 9.5% increase versus the prior year, in line**
with the policy of increasing progressively the dividend as a mark of its confidence in the Group’s prospects.

**SUSTAINABILITY**

Committed to electrifying the future with impact, the Group is recognized by rating agencies as one of the
best industry performers in terms of social responsibility. Nexans improved its Ecovadis score which
reached 80 out of 100 (Top 1%), and increased its CDP Climate rating to A, joining the prestigious Climate
“A list”. The Group was also included in the CAC® SBTi 1.5 index. These results demonstrate Nexans’
commitments to sustainability and the Group’s continued improvement over many years. Notable
developments in 2023 included:

− The accelerated deployment of the E3 performance model to ensure the convergence of Economic,
Engagement and Environment pillars. Some 300 managers were onboarded across the Group and
for the first time, business leaders for Electrification sites were set Economic and Environmental
targets.

− The reinforcement of Nexans’ commitments to fight global warming with the presentation of its
updated Climate plan at its Annual General Meeting. In line with the expectations of the Paris
Agreement to contain global warming at 1.5°C above preindustrial levels by the end of the century,
the Group has set itself an ambitious target, based on the SBTi (Science Based Target initiative)
approach targeting a 46% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 2030 compared to 2019,
and a 30% decrease in Scope 3 emissions by 2030. The company is also committed to achieving
Net Zero by 2050 for all scopes.

− Expansion of the Group’s sustainable offering with the launch of a new range of low-carbon medium
voltage cables. By adopting a holistic approach all along the value chain, the Group reduced the
greenhouse gas emissions of its low- and medium-voltage cables by 35% to 50% versus standard
cables. Furthermore, the Group made significant progress with Trimet in their joint development
project to improve the eco-balance of power cables by incorporating recycled aluminum content in
the production of aluminum rods used.

**2023 PERFORMANCE BY SEGMENT**

**| GENERATION & TRANSMISSION (13% OF TOTAL GROUP SALES)**

(in millions of euros) **2022[6]** **2023**

**Sales at standard metal prices** **958** **870**

_Organic growth_ _+11.6%_ _+0.8%_

**Adjusted EBITDA** **159** **83**

_Adjusted EBITDA as a % of standard sales_ _16.6%_ _9.5%_

Generation & Transmission standard sales came in at €870 million in 2023, up +0.8% organically
compared to 2022, and +17% excluding the Umbilicals activity which the Group is currently discontinuing.
Business was strong in the fourth quarter due to the execution of Sunrise Wind, Empire Wind 1 in the
United States and the Tyrrhenian Link projects.

Despite the rebound initiated in the second half of 2023, the segment’s **adjusted** **EBITDA reached**
€83 million in 2023, down -48% compared to 2022. The **adjusted** **EBITDA margin was 9.5% in 2023,**
versus 16.6% in 2022. The gradual margin upturn in the second half of 2023 to 10.8% (versus 7.8% in the
first half) came from improved project execution, and the US-based Charleston plant being fully rampedup, partially offsetting the dilutive impact of the execution of legacy projects and unfavorable currency
effect.

Customer activity remained robust, and in line with its risk-reward selectivity approach, the segment’s
**adjusted backlog reached €6.1 billion at December 31, 2023, up by 74% compared to December 31,**
2022, boosted by the fourth-quarter order for the Great Sea Interconnector (formerly EuroAsia) and the
Orkney project in the United Kingdom. On December 22, 2023, Nexans received an advance payment
from IPTO as part of the First Notice to Proceed of the Great Sea Interconnector. This marked the first
significant step in the contract signed last July.

The robust visibility of manufacturing and installation asset loads has been extended through 2030.
Strategic investments continued as planned throughout the year, with the completion of the Halden plant
extension in Norway early 2024 and the launch of an investment for a third cable-laying vessel to address
substantial backlog growth.

**| DISTRIBUTION (18% OF TOTAL GROUP SALES)**

(in millions of euros) **2022[6]** **2023**

_Organic growth_ _+12.2%_ _+4.5%_

**Adjusted EBITDA** **88** **156**

_Adjusted EBITDA as a % of standard sales_ _8.1%_ _13.2%_

**Standard sales** in the Distribution segment rose organically by +4.5% compared with 2022 to
€1,186 million. Demand was solid reflecting secular megatrends, including grid modernization and
renewable energy projects in Europe and North America. South America and Asia Pacific were slower due
to the timing of orders, while the Middle East and Africa remained strong. In this context, the Group
announced the signing of an MoU to build a new plant in Morocco the expand its production capacities.

**Adjusted** **EBITDA rose by a sharp 78% year-on-year to €156 million, supported by new**
frame-agreements, operational excellence and the contribution from the Reka Cables acquisition
completed in April 2023. In this context, the adjusted **EBITDA** **margin reached a record 13.2%, compared**
with 8.1% in 2022.

**Standard sales in the Usage segment amounted to €1,679 million in 2023. Sales were down -6.3%**
organically compared with the prior year, reflecting the normalization of volumes mainly in Canada as
anticipated. The Group benefited from a continued product mix improvement toward higher value-added
solutions, driven by the accelerated pace of adoption of fire safety cables and the launch of new products
and solutions. In this context, the Group announced the launch of a €40 million investment program over
the next three years at its Autun site in France, in order to accelerate its industry 4.0 and fire safety offer.
Europe was resilient despite the construction slowdown in some areas and destocking in the fourth quarter.
Demand was weak in Asia Pacific, while Middle East and Africa remained well-oriented.

**Adjusted** **EBITDA reached €229 million, up by 3.7% year-on-year, supported by sustained strength in**
pricing by higher value-added solutions, and the contribution from Reka Cables starting April 30, 2023,
offset by a negative currency effect mainly reflecting the depreciation of Canadian currency and the
devaluation of the Turkish currency. In this context, adjusted **EBITDA margin reached the high level of**
13.6% (vs 12.0% in 2022).

_Adjusted EBITDA as a % of standard sales_ _8.6%_ _10.6%_

**Standard sales** in the Industry & Solutions segment were €1,750 million in 2023, representing strong
organic year-on-year growth of +13.7% supported by solid momentum in Auto-harnesses, Shipbuilding,
Rail and Mining, as well as a recovery in Aerospace. Automation witnessed a slowdown in the second half
reflecting weakening orders after a period of solid execution.

**Adjusted** **EBITDA rose by +37% to €185 million, with an** **adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.6%, versus**
8.6% last year, reflecting operational improvements and product mix.

The Other Activities segment – corresponding for the most part to copper wire and telecom sales, and
including corporate structural costs that cannot be allocated to other segments – reported standard sales
of €1,026 million in 2023. Sales were down -17.9% organically year-on-year, mainly linked to the Group’s
strategy to reduce copper wire external sales through tolling agreements in order to mitigate their dilutive
effect.

The segment’s adjusted **EBITDA was stable at €13 million in 2023, versus €13 million in 2022, reflecting**
profitability enhancement within the Metallurgy activity, more than offsetting the divestment of Aginode

which marked the exit of the Group from the Telecom System business. Starting 2023, the segment’s
adjusted EBITDA excluded share-based payment expenses amounting to €16 million in 2022 and €13
million in 2023.

**2024 OUTLOOK**
In 2024, Nexans expects to benefit from continued buoyant market demand, supported by global
megatrends in electrification, as well as its structural transformation and value-added solutions to support
its growth and profitability improvements. The Distribution market is currently entering a hyper cycle of
investment. The record risk-reward backlog in Generation & Transmission provides solid visibility, and the
Group will benefit from the contribution of the ramp-up of the Halden plant in Norway.

At the beginning of the year, the macroeconomic context is marked by ongoing weak demand in some
geographies in construction. Countries affected in 2023, proved to be resilient thanks to value-added offers,
customer selectivity and the strong focus on cash generation. In this demanding context, some initiatives
are already in place and Nexans will draw on the agility and commitment of its teams to adapt to changes
and continue to focus on cash generation. A progressive improvement is expected throughout the year and
datacenters, industrial and mobility markets are expected to remain resilient.

In this context for 2024, assuming there are no conjunctural effects and excluding non-closed acquisitions
and divestments, Nexans expects to achieve:

- Adjusted EBITDA of between €670 and 730 million;

- Normalized Free Cash Flow of between €200 and 300 million.

Moreover, the Group is confirming its 2024 Capital Markets Day targets and will continue the
implementation of its strategic roadmap and priorities.

**SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SINCE THE END OF DECEMBER**
**On February 9[th]** – Nexans announced the signing of a landmark agreement to acquire the iconic La
Triveneta Cavi, with recognized excellence within the European medium- and low-voltage segments.
Based in Italy, La Triveneta Cavi primarily manufactures low-voltage cables for building, infrastructure, fireretardant cable systems and renewable applications across 30 countries. The company employs a
workforce of approximately 700 people and generated current revenues of more than 800 million euros
over the last twelve months.

Financing is secured through a bridge-to-bond agreement signed on February 8[th], 2024. The transaction
will be financed by cash and debt with limited impact on net debt to adj. EBITDA ratio enabling the Group
to maintain strong credit metrics. After financing of the transaction, net debt to adj. EBITDA ratio is expected
to not exceed 1.0x. Closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other
customary closing conditions.

**On February 2[nd]** – Nexans was awarded a major contract to supply a leading Italian utility with 6,000 km
of low- and medium-voltage power distribution cables and services to support the energy transition in Italy,
beginning in February 2024 and for a duration of 16 months.

**4.** The issue of the Notes has been authorised pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors
(Conseil d’administration) of the Issuer dated [●] 2024 and was decided by [Mr. Christopher Guérin,
Chief Executive Officer (Directeur général)] of the Issuer on [●] 2024.

**5.** The yield of the Notes is [●] per cent. per annum, as calculated at the Issue Date on the basis of
the issue price of the Notes. It is not an indication of future yield.

**6.** Save for any fees payable to the Managers, as far as the Issuer is aware, no person involved in the

performance or trading position of the Issuer or the Group since 31 December 2023.

**8.** [Save as disclosed in this Prospectus, t/T]here has been no material adverse change in the
prospects of the Issuer or the Group since 31 December 2023.

**9.** Save as disclosed in this Prospectus, there are no governmental, administrative, legal or arbitration

purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially
the Notes. The Managers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or
