**RISK FACTORS**

_Prior to making an investment decision, prospective investors should consider carefully all of the information set_
_out and incorporated by reference in this Prospectus, including in particular the following risk factors._
_Prospective investors should be aware that this section is not intended to be exhaustive and that the risks_
_described herein may combine and thus modify one another. They should make their own independent_
_evaluations of all risk factors and should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus._
_Terms defined in "Terms and Conditions of the Notes" below shall have the same meaning in the following_
_section._

**RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE ISSUER**

**Risk identification and management**

In addition to regular business reviews of the subsidiaries by headquarters and monthly reporting by
area managers, Nexans has implemented procedures designed to identify and manage risks. For further
information in this regard, see the Chairman’s report on the Board of Directors’ Operations and the
Company’s Internal Control Procedures on pages 206 to 218 of this Prospectus.

The most important risks identified which apply to Nexans’ operations and to the Group are described
below.

**Financial risks**

Risks related to fluctuations in interest rates, exchange rates, metal prices, and counterparty credit are
discussed in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 150 to 153 of this Prospectus,
and in Section 6.2 of the Board of Directors’ Management Report on page 78 of this Prospectus.

Risks related to liquidity and customer credit are discussed in Sections 6.3 and 6.4 of the Board of
Directors’ Management Report on pages 78 to 81 of this Prospectus.

**Risks related to the seasonal nature of Nexans’ business**

Nexans’ business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Consequently, income generated during the first
six months of the year is generally lower than in the second half of the year. Historically, this
difference can largely be explained by the following factors:

- a large number of Nexans’ products are linked to the construction of outdoor infrastructure. Orders
relating to these products therefore tend to be placed when climatic conditions are more favorable,
particularly in the second and third quarters of the year;

- customers generally place major orders for delivery during the fourth quarter, at the end of the
annual budget year, particularly for public works projects;

- Nexans’ working capital requirements increase significantly during the first quarter of each year
due to the increase in inventories needed to fulfill orders already placed or expected during the second
and third quarters. The increase in working capital requirements during the first and second quarters
generally leads to an increase in debt levels and thus financial expenses. During the third and fourth
quarters, a decrease in Nexans’ working capital requirements and debt levels is generally observed.

**Risks related to contractual liability**

The nature of Nexans’ business exposes it to claims for product liability and claims for damage to
property or third parties allegedly caused by its products. Nexans provides warranties relating to the
performance of its products which may cover a considerable period of time.


-----

In addition, warranties given to Nexans pursuant to contracts for the supply of the materials and
components used in its products may be less extensive than the warranties Nexans gives to its
customers, for example, in the optical fiber sector.

9 to 10% of Nexans’ consolidated sales (based on constant non-ferrous metal prices) derive from
contracts for the supply and installation of cables as part of turnkey infrastructure projects. These
contracts relate primarily to high-voltage landbased and undersea cables. Individual contracts often
have a high value and contain penalty and liability clauses in the event Nexans is unable to comply
with the delivery schedule or with quality requirements (for example, technical defects requiring
intervention after installation due to product non-conformity resulting from production anomalies).

If these clauses are invoked, the amount of penalties involved, the size of claims for damages or the
financial impact on the project due to delays could have a significant negative impact on Nexans’
financial situation and income.

The Group has put in place a stringent product quality control system to limit these risks. A large
number of Nexans’ units are ISO 9001 or 9002 certified, as appropriate. Overall quality is a driving
force behind the continuous improvement plan that is part of the Group’s Corporate Program +
initiative.

Methodologies used in Program + are strictly aligned with ISO 9000-2000 certification criteria. Every
month, units monitor a set of indicators used to evaluate progress made in terms of quality and
customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction surveys are also used throughout the Group.

In addition, large contracts are subjected to a systematic risk evaluation procedure.

Particular focus is placed on raising the awareness of the Group's sales teams in relation to the risks
inherent in sales contracts and on the negotiation of standard contract terms, with the involvement of
the Group’s Legal Department.

Furthermore, Nexans currently has liability insurance coverage that it considers to be in line with
industry standards, but it cannot guarantee this insurance offers sufficient coverage for all of the
liability claims filed against the Group (see page 188 of this Prospectus).

**Risks related to dependence on customers**

Nexans’ activities are spread across a variety of businesses (energy, telecommunications, electrical
wires), and it has many different types of final customer (distributors, equipment manufacturers,
industrial operators, public operators) in a wide range of countries. This diversity acts as a safeguard
for the Group as a whole and no customer accounts for more than 3% of consolidated sales.
Nonetheless, given the level of operating income involved and the difficult market conditions, the loss
of one customer, particularly in niche markets such as automobiles, shipbuilding and aerospace, which
are more concentrated, could have an impact on Nexans’ income. In addition, the demand for certain
products is affected by the economic environment of the related business sector, such as in the oil
industry for example.

**Risks related to raw materials and supplies**

Copper, aluminum and plastic are the main raw materials used by Nexans. Therefore, price
fluctuations and the availability of products have a direct effect on the Group’s business. Nexans has
so far always been able to obtain adequate supplies at reasonable prices. A global copper shortage or
interruptions of supplies could have an adverse effect notwithstanding that Nexans has diversified its
sources of supply as much as possible in order to reduce these risks. The situation is to some extent
similar for petroleum byproducts such as polyethylene, PVC and plasticizers. The inability to source
raw materials at reasonable prices could therefore adversely affect Nexans’ business and income.


-----

The Group’s policy is always to have at least two suppliers for any raw material or component used in
manufacturing its products. There are nonetheless certain isolated cases where the Group uses a sole
supplier, particularly for the materials used to make high voltage cables.

An increase in raw material, energy or transportation costs could have a significant impact on Nexans’
business or income.

As part of its strategic purchasing policy to secure the supply of certain raw materials in terms of both
volume and price (i.e., the LME price plus a premium), Nexans – which uses around 800,000 metric
tons/year of copper – signed copper cathode purchasing contracts with two suppliers extending until
2009. The annual volume purchased under these contracts is fixed in November of the preceding year,
and for 2007 amounted to approximately 400,000 metric tons. The Group has also signed copper
cathode purchasing contracts with other suppliers incorporating fixed annual volumes.

In addition, the Group uses around 140,000 metric tons/year of aluminum. To secure its supplies of
aluminum wirerod and in view of the market for aluminum, the Group has placed firm purchase orders
for amounts sufficient to cover its needs in 2007 and given firm purchase commitments for
50,000 metric tons/year for 2008 through 2012.

As these products are listed on regulated markets, the Group could sell any quantities that are
purchased but not subsequently used, although it may incur a loss related to the bid/offer spread.

In addition, in view of the Group’s prominent role in the undersea high-voltage and umbilical cables
market, it needs a cable-laying vessel capable of performing the Group’s installation contracts within
the timeframes required. As there is a limited market for such vessels, in November 2006, Nexans
acquired the cable laying vessel, _Bourbon Skagerrak,_ from Bourbon Cable AS, a Norwegian
subsidiary of the French group Bourbon. This vessel – which has been renamed Nexans Skagerrak – is
one of the few in the world specially designed to transport and lay umbilical cables and high-voltage
subsea cables. Before the acquisition, Nexans had operated this vessel through an exclusive long-term
chartering contract.

**Geopolitical risks in high-growth areas**

High-growth countries are one of the Group's avenues for expansion but certain of these areas
represent significant geopolitical risks. In 2006, Nexans generated between 2% and 3% of its
consolidated sales (at current non-ferrous metal prices) in countries classified by Coface as having a
very uncertain economic and political climate or representing a very high risk that could result in a
deterioration or aggravation of payment behavior.

**Risks related to the Group’s competitive environment**

The cable industry remains relatively fragmented both regionally and internationally, and the cable,
wire and cabling system markets are highly competitive. The number and size of Nexans’ competitors
vary depending on the market, the geographical area and product line concerned. Consequently, the
Group has several competitors in each of its businesses. Furthermore, for certain businesses and in
certain regional markets, Nexans’ main competitors may have a stronger position or have access to
greater know-how or resources than Nexans.

In recent years, cable makers have had to contend with a global crisis in the telecommunications
markets and the steady increase in trade of certain types of low value- added cable among countries in
a given region. This has led a number of market players to launch restructuring programs to reduce
excess production capacity. Apart from these corrective measures however, there have been no radical
changes to the structure of the industry and it remains relatively fragmented both regionally and
globally.


-----

Conditions have become more favorable for the industry since 2005 and capacity is being better used.
New actors are coming onto the scene encouraged by the development of new markets, especially in
emerging countries.

As certain of its products (cables, wires and accessories) must comply with industry specifications and
are interchangeable with the products of its main domestic and international competitors, Nexans faces
stiff competition in most of its markets in terms of price, delivery time and service. In the industrial
sector, OEM customers (“Original Equipment Manufacturers”) are shifting away from standardized
products, meaning that Nexans must be increasingly flexible and develop new solutions so as to
accommodate ever more demanding specifications and functionality requirements.

The principal competitive factors in the cable industry are cost, service, product quality and
availability, geographical coverage and the range of products offered.

In this environment, Nexans must constantly invest and improve its performance in order to retain any
competitive advantages it may have in certain markets. In addition, the Group is continuing its efforts
in R&D, logistics, and marketing in order to differentiate itself from the competition. At the same
time, faced with constant downward pressure on prices, Nexans is focused on reducing costs through
continuously streamlining its production processes as well as plans to boost its manufacturing
performance. These restructuring measures are expected to cost approximately 30 million euros per
year.

**Risks related to technologies used**

In order to remain competitive, Nexans must anticipate advances in technology when developing its
own products and manufacturing processes. The demand for products that consume less energy, are
recyclable and less polluting, and especially better value products, require the creation of innovative
manufacturing processes, the use of new materials and the development of new wires and cables. Most
of the markets in which Nexans has a presence tend to favor the use of highly technological products;
it is therefore important that Nexans undertakes research providing it with access to the technologies
necessary and valued by the market.

Moreover, despite its Research and Development efforts and the ongoing monitoring of potentially
competing technologies, there is no guarantee that the technologies currently used by Nexans will not
ultimately be replaced by new technologies developed by its leading competitors, or that its
competitors will not allege infringement, or that Nexans will be able to successfully launch new
products that respond perfectly to customer demand.

**Risks related to environmental regulations**

Nexans is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the environment in each of the
countries where it operates, in particular in the European Union, the United States and Canada.

These laws and regulations impose increasingly strict environmental standards, particularly in relation
to atmospheric pollution, wastewater disposal, the emission, use and handling of toxic materials and
waste, waste disposal methods, site cleanups and treatment. These standards expose Nexans to the
possibility of liability claims being filed against it, and to significant costs (e.g. for liability with
respect to current or past activities or related to assets sold).

The Group has a voluntary internal environmental management system that has been operational for
several years. This system is intended to lead to the EHP label being awarded, denoting the Group’s
compliance with the highest environmental standards. For further information in this regard, see
Section 16.1 of the Management Report on pages 89 to 94 of this Prospectus.


-----

In France, the government department responsible for the environment has published a national
directory of potentially polluted sites and launched a program to examine and clean up these sites. As a
result, Nexans has started investigations or remediation activities at four of its sites.

In the United States, Nexans is subject to several federal and state environmental laws, which could
make certain categories of entity defined by law liable for the full amount of cleanup costs relating to
environmental pollution, even if no fault is determined and the relevant operations comply with
applicable regulations. Nexans has often been cited, together with others, as potentially liable for
pollution pursuant to the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability
Act. Nexans has been joined to these proceedings although the pollution referred to is associated with
waste dumps and did not arise on its manufacturing or production sites. The potential liability of
Nexans in relation to these proceedings has not adversely affected its financial position or income in
the past but it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no negative effects in the future.

In general, various types of environmental claims are made against the Group in the normal course of
business. Based on the amounts claimed and the status of the proceedings concerned, together with its
evaluation of the risks involved and its provisioning policy, Nexans believes that there is little risk that
these claims will significantly affect its financial position or income. The main environmental claim
currently outstanding against the Group concerns a dispute in Duisburg, Germany, brought by the
purchasers of a site and a city council relating to soil and ground water contamination. This soil
contamination is long-standing and Nexans’ full liability has not been established although analyses
are currently underway. Nexans has, however, recorded provisions to cover any responsibility it may
have for cleanup costs.

Nexans applies the following rules when recognizing provisions in relation to environmental matters.
A provision is recognized when the information and documents available indicate that a future
outgoing of economic resources is likely, significant and quantifiable. If these criteria are not met, any
such potential outgoings of economic resources are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial
statements where the amount concerned is material. Where such an outgoing is unlikely no provision
is recognized and no disclosure is made in the notes to the financial statements. Nexans estimates
environmental remediation or cleanup costs on a case-by-case basis and as accurately as possible,
based on the information available.

At December 31, 2006, the amount of provisions recorded for environmental risks was 6.446 million
euros. These provisions include amounts relating to the above-mentioned dispute in Duisburg, the
cleanup of a waste dump on the site of its Swedish subsidiary and others costs related to current or
planned soil cleanup operations after the use of products such as solvents or oil, at sites including
Bramsche in Germany and Buizingen in Belgium. In addition, additional expenses may be incurred for
the clean-up of sites that have been closed and are likely to be sold. However, the Company expects
that these expenses will represent less than the market value of the sites in question.

Nexans believes that unprovisioned costs for the cleanup of sites that have not yet been audited should
not have a significant impact on its earnings.

Nexans cannot guarantee that future events, in particular changes in legislation or the development or
discovery of new facts or conditions, will not lead to additional costs that could have a significant
adverse effect on its business, financial position or income.

**Nexans’ position on asbestos**

The manufacture of Nexans products does not involve any handling of asbestos.
In the past (and particularly to comply with French army specifications), asbestos was used to a
limited extent to improve the insulation of certain kinds of cables to be used for military purposes. It
was also used in the manufacture of enameled ovens at two sites in France, but this activity was
discontinued several decades ago.


-----

To date, 41 people in France have been classified as suffering from an occupational disease, of which
8 have filed proceedings against their employer (TLM ). In addition, some 84 employees (44 at
Nexans Wires and 40 at SCCC) are subject to medical monitoring.

Management does not believe that this risk is likely to have a significant impact on the Group’s
financial position or earnings.

**Insurance coverage**

In addition to local mandatory insurance coverage and individual insurance taken out directly by the
Group’s various units, Nexans has had a Group insurance program in place since 2003. Companies in
which Nexans has more than a 50% stake are eligible to participate in this program.
The overall coverage under this program changed little during 2006 compared to the previous year and
was renewed on January 1, 2007 at similar levels, with the exception of coverage for space industry
products which was, as in 2006, less than the coverage obtained through 2004.

The main types of insurance coverage under this program are as follows:

– property and casualty and business interruption,
– general civil operating and product liability,
– transportation,
– contractor’s all risk insurance for land-based projects,
– aeronautic and space civil liability,
– short-term credit risk to secure accounts receivable from certain domestic and export
customers, Directors’ liability.

The limits on these policies are based on a historical analysis of the company’s claims experience and
on the advice of its brokers. They generally exceed the maximum amount of insured claims
experienced by the Group in the past.

These policies are, however, subject to coverage exclusions that result in limitations on the transfer of
risk.

The property and casualty and business interruption policy is subject to limitations applicable to
certain units.

Certain countries or regions are currently excluded from the Group’s insurance program (e.g. Nigeria)
and certain geographical areas have more limited coverage for risks related to natural catastrophes,
including areas with high seismic risk such as Greece, Italy, and Turkey.

The short-term credit risk policy has been rolled out country by country as part of a global, multi-year
program renewed in 2006 for two years. At the end of 2006, companies in the Group’s scope of
consolidation that had subscribed to this policy made up 80% of Nexans consolidated sales.

With respect to civil liability resulting from aeronautic or space products, coverage for damages
caused to third parties is limited to the occurrence of severe accidents or decisions to ground aircraft
made by domestic or international civil aviation authorities, and excludes all other kinds of liability. It
is possible that very infrequent yet highly serious claims may considerably exceed the related sales
generated and significantly affect Nexans’ operating income.

Finally, there is a trend among third parties, customers and suppliers, as well as in the insurance
market, towards increased litigation to limit or expand the scope of contractual undertakings. The
possibility of legal action being taken creates further uncertainties as to the amount of risk transferred.


-----

With respect to political risk, the Group has no coverage for financial assets shown on the balance
sheet. Risks related to acts of terrorism are covered by the insurance legally required in certain
countries.

Nexans does not have any captive insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries. However, in December 2006,
the Accounts and Audit Committee authorized the creation of a reinsurance subsidiary so as to better
manage the Group’s risk retention. This subsidiary should be operational in 2008, and will become
progressively more involved in Nexans’ insurance program in line with opportunities and limitations
in the insurance market.

The Group relies on the expertise of a global network of insurance brokers to assist it in the control
and management of the risks to which it is exposed in all the countries where it operates.

Nexans has strengthened its commitment to reducing industrial risks by putting in place a specific 3year investment program for 2005 through 2007. This program was designed in close cooperation
between the Industrial Management Department and experts from the Group’s property and casualty
insurer. These experts visit the industrial sites on an annual basis, making very specific
recommendations on how to improve risk prevention and safety, and they monitor the implementation
of these recommendations.

**Applicable law and regulations**

As far as the Company is aware, there are no laws or regulations specific to the cable industry that
apply in addition to general industry in regulations. The Group’s various sites comply with the
applicable national laws and regulations relating in particular to emissions into the air, water and soil,
which vary according to the country where the sites are located.

**RISK FACTORS RELATING TO THE NOTES**

**Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors**

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of such
investor’s own circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes,
the merits and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or
incorporated by reference in this Prospectus;
(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context
of its particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such
investment will have on its overall investment portfolio;
(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in
the Notes;
(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes; and
(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios
for economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to
bear the relevant risks.

**Market Value of the Notes**

The market value of the Notes will be affected by the creditworthiness of the Issuer and a number of
additional factors, including, but not limited to, market interest and yield rates and the time remaining
to the maturity date. The value of the Notes depends on a number of interrelated factors, including
economic, financial and political events in France or elsewhere, including factors affecting capital


-----

markets generally and the stock exchanges on which the Notes are traded. The price at which a
Noteholder will be able to sell the Notes prior to maturity may be at a discount, which could be
substantial, from the issue price or the purchase price paid by such Noteholder.

**An active trading market for the Notes may not develop (liquidity risk)**

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Notes will develop, or, if one does
develop, that it will be maintained. If an active trading market for the Notes does not develop or is not
maintained, the market or trading price and liquidity of the Notes may be adversely affected. The
Issuer is entitled to buy the Notes for its own account or for the account of others, and to issue further
Notes. Such transactions may favourably or adversely affect the price development of the Notes. If
additional and competing products are introduced in the markets, this may adversely affect the value
of the Notes.

In addition, exercise of the Put Option, as defined and provided in Condition 8 in respect of any Notes
may affect the liquidity of the Notes in respect of which such put option is not exercised. Depending
on the number of Notes in respect of which the put option is exercised, any trading market in respect
of any outstanding Notes may become to varying degrees less liquid.

**Redemption Risk**

The Notes may at the option of the Issuer, and shall in certain circumstances, be redeemed, in whole
but not in part, at their principal amount together with accrued interest for certain tax reasons (see
"Terms and Conditions of the Notes – Redemption and Purchase"). There can be no assurance that, at
the relevant time, Noteholders will be able to reinvest the amounts received upon redemption at a rate
that will provide the same return as their investment in the Notes.

**Long-term securities**

The Notes will be redeemed on 2 May 2017. The Issuer is under no obligation to redeem the Notes at
any time before this date. The Noteholders have no right to call for their redemption except upon the
occurrence of a Put Event as provided in Condition 8 or upon the occurrence of an Event of Default as
provided in Condition 9. The Notes may, and in certain circumstances shall, be redeemed, in whole but
not in part, at their principal amount together with accrued interest in the event that certain French
taxes are imposed as provided in Condition 5.

**Exchange rate risk**

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in euro. This presents certain risks relating to
currency conversions if an investor’s financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or
currency unit other than euro (the "Investor’s Currency"). These include the risk that exchange rates
may significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of Euro or revaluation of the
Investor’s Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor’s Currency may
impose or modify exchange controls. As a result, investors may receive less interest or principal than
expected.

**Fixed Rate**

The Notes bearing interest at a fixed rate, investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent
changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the value of the Notes.

**No Legal and Tax Advice**

A Noteholder's effective yield on the Notes may be diminished by the tax impact on that Noteholder of
its investment in the Notes.


-----

A Noteholder's actual yield on the Notes may be reduced from the stated yield by transaction costs.

Each prospective investor should consult its own advisers as to legal, tax and related aspects of an
investment in the Notes.

**2.** **Status**

The principal and interest in respect of the Notes constitute direct, unconditional, unsecured and
unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank and will at all times rank _pari passu without any_
preference among themselves and (subject to such exceptions as are from time to time mandatory
under French law) equally and rateably with any other present or future unsecured and unsubordinated
obligations of the Issuer.

**3.** **Negative Pledge**

The Issuer undertakes, until all the Notes have been redeemed, not to grant any mortgage (hypothèque)
over its present or future real property assets or interests, nor any pledge (nantissement), charge
(gage), or any other security interest (sûreté réelle) on its present or future assets or incomes, to
holders of other bonds (obligations) issued or guaranteed by the Issuer, which are, or are capable of


-----

being, admitted to trading on a regulated market, unless at the same time the Notes are equally and
rateably secured therewith.

Such undertaking is given only in relation to security interests given for the benefit of holders of bonds
(obligations) which are, or are capable of being, admitted to trading on a regulated market and does
not affect in any way the right of the Issuer to dispose of its assets or to grant any security in respect of
such assets in any other circumstance.

**4.** **Interest**

**_(a)_** **_Interest Payment Dates_**

The Notes bear interest from, and including, 2 May 2007 to but excluding 2 may 2017 at the rate of
5.75 per cent. per annum payable annually in arrear on 2 May in each year (each an "Interest
**Payment Date"). The first payment of interest will be made on 2 May 2008 for the period from, and**
including, the Issue Date to, but excluding, 2 May 2008.

**_(b)_** **_Interest Payments_**

Each Note will cease to bear interest from the due date for redemption, unless payment of principal is
improperly withheld or refused on such date. In such event, interest on such Note shall continue to
accrue at such rate until, and including, whichever is the earlier of (i) the day on which all sums due in
respect of such Note up to that day are received by or on behalf of the relevant holder and (ii) the day
of receipt by or on behalf of Euroclear France of all sums due in respect of all the Notes.

Interest shall be calculated on an Actual/Actual - ICMA basis, as follows:

(i) if the Accrual Period is equal to or shorter than the Determination Period during which
it falls, the Actual/Actual-ICMA basis will be the number of days in the Accrual Period
divided by the product of (x) the number of days in such Determination Period and (y)
the number of Determination Periods normally ending in any year; and

(ii) if the Accrual Period is longer than one Determination Period, the Actual/ActualICMA basis will be the sum of:

(a) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the Determination Period
in which it begins divided by the product of (1) the number of days in such
Determination Period and (2) the number of Determination Periods normally
ending in any year; and

(b) the number of days in such Accrual Period falling in the next Determination
Period divided by the product of (1) the number of days in such Determination
Period and (2) the number of Determination Periods normally ending in any
year

subdivision or authority therein or thereof having power to tax, or any change in the official
application or interpretation of such law or regulation (including a holding by a competent
court), becoming effective after the Issue Date, the Issuer would, on the occasion of the next
payment of principal or interest due in respect of the Notes, not be able to make such payment
without having to pay additional amounts as specified in Condition 7, the Issuer may, at its sole
discretion, at any time, subject to having given not more than 60 nor less than 30 days' prior

redeem all, but not some only, of the Notes outstanding at their principal amount, together with
all interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption, provided that the due date for redemption
of which notice hereunder may be given shall be no earlier than the latest practicable date on
which the Issuer could make payment of principal or interest without withholding for French
taxes.

(ii) If the Issuer would on the next payment of principal or interest in respect of the Notes be

Issuer shall, subject to having given not less than seven days' prior notice to the Noteholders in

only, of the Notes at their principal amount, together with all interest accrued to the date fixed

If any French law or regulation should require that any payment of principal or interest in respect of
the Notes be subject to deduction or withholding with respect to any present or future taxes, duties,
assessments or other governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of
the Republic of France or any political subdivision or authority therein or thereof having power to tax,

liable to pay any such additional amounts in respect of any Note to a holder (or beneficial owner
(ayant _droit)):_

(i) who is subject to such taxes, duties, assessments or other governmental charges, in respect of
such Note by reason of his having some connection with the Republic of France other than the
mere holding of such Note;

(ii) more than 30 days after the Relevant Date (as defined below), except to the extent that the
holder thereof would have been entitled to such additional amounts on the last day of such
period of 30 days;

with Condition 12 to Noteholders that such moneys have been so received.


-----

Any reference in these Conditions to principal and/or interest shall be deemed to include any
additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition 7.

**8.** **Change of Control**

If at any time while any Note remains outstanding there occurs a Put Event, the holder of each Note
will have the option (the “Put Option”) (unless, prior to the giving of the Put Event Notice (as defined
below), the Issuer gives notice of its intention to redeem the Notes under Condition 5(b)) to require the
Issuer to redeem or, at the Issuer's option, to procure the purchase of that Note on the Optional
Redemption Date (as defined below) at the Put Amount (as defined below).

A "Put Event" shall be deemed to have occurred at each time (i) a Change of Control occurs and (ii)
within the Change of Control Period a Rating Downgrade occurs in respect of that Change of Control
or, as the case may be, potential Change of Control.

A "Change of Control" in respect of the Issuer shall be deemed to have occurred at each time
(whether or not approved by the Issuer) that any Relevant Person(s), at any time following the Issue
Date of the Notes, acquire(s) Control of the Issuer unless such Relevant Person(s) is (are) under the
Control of Nexans immediately prior to such Change of Control.

"Relevant Person" means any person or persons acting in concert (as defined in Article L.233-10 of
the French Code de commerce) or any person or persons acting on behalf of any such person(s).

Person of:

total voting rights normally exercisable at an ordinary or extraordinary shareholders’
general meeting of the Issuer; or

(c) a number of shares in the ordinary share capital of such entity carrying at least 40 per cent.
of the voting rights exercisable in ordinary or extraordinary shareholders’ general meetings
of the Issuer where no other shareholder of such entity, directly or indirectly, acting alone or
in concert with others, holds a number of shares carrying a percentage of the voting rights
exercisable in such general meetings which is higher than the percentage of voting rights
attached to the number of shares held by such Relevant Person.

"Put Amount" means in respect of any Note an amount equal to 101% of its principal amount together
with (or, where purchased, together with an amount equal to) accrued interest to but excluding the
Optional Redemption Date.

(i) within the Change of Control Period:

(a) the investment grade credit rating (Baa3/BBB-, or equivalent, or better) assigned to the
Notes by any Rating Agency is (x) either downgraded to a non-investment grade credit
rating (Ba1/BB+, or equivalent, or worse) or withdrawn and (y) is not within the Change of
Control Period subsequently (in the case of a downgrade) upgraded or (in the case of a
withdrawal) reinstated to an investment grade credit rating by such Rating Agency; or


-----

(b) the non-investment grade credit rating (Ba1/BB+, or equivalent, or worse) assigned to the
Notes by any Rating Agency is (x) downgraded by one or more notches (for illustration,
Ba1/BB+ to Ba2/BB being one notch) or withdrawn and (y) is not within the Change of
Control Period subsequently (in the case of a downgrade) upgraded or (in the case of a
withdrawal) reinstated to its earlier credit rating or better by such Rating Agency; or

(c) the Notes have no credit rating, and no Rating Agency assigns within the Change of Control
Period an investment grade credit rating to the Notes, provided that if on the Relevant
Announcement Date the Notes carry a credit rating from more than one rating agency, at
least one of which is investment grade, then sub-paragraph (a) will apply; and

(ii) in making the relevant decision(s) referred to (a) and (b) above, the relevant Rating Agency
announces publicly or confirms in writing to the Issuer, the Fiscal Agent or the holder of any
Note, that such decision(s) resulted directly, in whole or to a significant degree, from the
occurrence of the Change of Control or, as the case may be, potential Change of Control,

_provided that if the rating designations employed by any Rating Agency are changed from those in_
force at the time of the Issue Date, the Issuer shall determine the rating designations of such Rating
Agency as are most equivalent to the prior rating designations of such Rating Agency and this
Condition 8 shall be read accordingly.

"Rating Agencies" means Standard & Poor's Rating Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill
Companies, Inc. and/or Moody's Investor Services and/or Fitch Ratings and their respective successors
or affiliates and/or any other rating agency of equivalent international standing specified from time to
time by the Issuer which has a current rating of the Notes at any relevant time (each a "Rating
**Agency").**

"Change of Control Period" means the period commencing on the Relevant Announcement Date and
ending 180 days after the Change of Control, or such longer period for which the Notes are under
consideration (such consideration having been announced publicly within the period ending 180 days
after the Change of Control) for rating review or, as the case may be, under consideration for rating by
a rating agency, such period not to exceed 90 days after the public announcement of such
consideration.

"Relevant Announcement Date" means the earlier of (x) the date of the first public announcement of
the relevant Change of Control; and (y) the date of the first public announcement or statement by the
Issuer, any actual or potential bidder or any advisor thereto relating to any potential Change of Control
where within 180 days following the date of such announcement or statement, a Change of Control
occurs.

Immediately upon the Issuer becoming aware that a Put Event has occurred, the Issuer shall, give
notice (a "Put Event Notice") to the Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 specifying the
nature of the Put Event and the procedure for exercising the Put Option contained in this Condition 8.

To exercise the Put Option to require the redemption or, as the case may be, or purchase of a Note
under this Condition 8 the holder of that Note must transfer or cause to be transferred by its Account
Holder its Notes to be so redeemed or purchased to the account of the Put Agent specified in the Put
Event Notice for the account of the Issuer within the period of 120 days after the Put Event Notice is
given (the "Put Period"), together with a duly signed and completed notice of exercise in the form
(for the time being current) obtainable from the specified office of any Paying Agent (a "Put Option
**Notice") and in which the holder may specify a Euro-denominated bank account to which payment is**
to be made under this Condition 8.

The Issuer shall redeem or, at the option of the Issuer, procure the purchase of the Notes in respect of
which the Put Option has been validly exercised as provided above, and subject to the transfer of such


-----

Notes to the account of the Put Agent for the account of the Issuer as described above, on the date
which is the tenth Business Day following the end of the Put Period (the "Optional Redemption
**Date"). Payment in respect of any Note so transferred will be made in Euro to the holder to the Euro-**
denominated bank account specified in the relevant Put Option Notice on the Optional Redemption
Date via the relevant Account Holder.

If 80 per cent. or more in nominal amount of the Notes then outstanding have been redeemed pursuant
to this Condition 8, the Issuer may, on not less than 30 or more than 60 days' notice to the Noteholders
given within 30 days after the Put Date, redeem, at its option, the remaining Notes as a whole at the
Put Amount.

**9.** **Events of Default**

The Representative (as defined in Condition 11 below), acting on behalf of the Masse (as defined in
Condition 11 below), may, upon written notice to the Issuer (copy to the Fiscal Agent) before all
defaults shall have been cured, cause all, but not some only, of the Notes to become immediately due
and payable, at their principal amount together with any accrued interest thereon:

  - if any amount of principal of, or interest on, any Note is not paid on the due date thereof and
such default is not remedied within a period of 7 days from such due date; or

  - if any other obligations of the Issuer under the Notes is not complied with or performed within
a period of 30 days after receipt by the Issuer of written notice of such default given by the
Representative (as defined in Condition 11); or

  - if the Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined below) defaults in the payment of
any other financial indebtedness or guarantee of financial indebtedness in a total amount at
least equal to €35 million on its due date or, as the case may be, at the end of any applicable
grace period, unless the Issuer challenges such default in good faith before a competent
tribunal, in which case an early redemption of the Notes will be mandatory only if the tribunal
has found against the Issuer and the Issuer has not complied with the judgement in accordance
with its terms; or

  - if any other financial indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined
below) in an amount in excess of €35 million is declared due and payable due to a failure to
pay of the Issuer or such Principal Subsidiary (including any failure to comply with financial
ratios provided in the agreements relating to such indebtedness), unless the Issuer challenges
such default in good faith before a competent tribunal, in which case an early redemption of
the Notes will be mandatory only if the tribunal has found against the Issuer and the Issuer has
not complied with the judgement in accordance with its terms; or

  - in the case where the Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries (as defined below) has applied
to enter into a conciliation procedure (procédure de conciliation) or into a safeguard
procedure (procédure de sauvegarde), or a judgment is issued for the judicial liquidation
(liquidation judiciaire) or for the transfer of the whole of the business (cession totale de
_l’entreprise) of the Issuer, or if the Issuer is subject to any other similar measure or_
proceeding.

For the purposes of this provision, “Principal Subsidiary” shall mean a company in which the Issuer
holds, directly or indirectly more than 50% of the share capital or voting rights and which represents
more than 5% of (i) the consolidated revenues of the Issuer, or (ii) the consolidated assets of the
Issuer, calculated by reference to the latest audited consolidated financial statements of the Issuer.


-----

**10.** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer for the payment of principal and interest in respect of the Notes shall become
prescribed 10 years (in the case of principal) and 5 years (in the case of interest) from the due date for
payment thereof.

**11.** **Representation of the Noteholders**

The Noteholders will be grouped automatically for the defence of their respective common interests in
a masse (hereinafter referred to as the "Masse").

The Masse will be governed in accordance with Article L. 228-90 of the Code de Commerce (French

The _Masse will be a separate legal entity, by virtue of Article L.228-46 of the Code, acting in part_
through a representative (the "Representative") and in part through a general assembly of
Noteholders.

The _Masse alone, to the exclusion of all individual Noteholders, shall exercise the common rights,_
actions and benefits which now or in the future may accrue with respect to the Notes.

**_(b)_** **_Representative_**

The office of Representative may be conferred on a person of any nationality. However, the following

With energy as the basis of its development, Nexans, the worldwide leader in the cable industry, offers

industry and building markets. Nexans addresses a series of market segments from energy, transport
and telecom networks to shipbuilding, oil and gas, nuclear, automotive, electronics, aeronautics,
handling and automation.
Its products meet the most demanding requirements in terms of performance, quality, and the
environment. Its services cover the entire value chain, from upstream to downstream: research, design,
manufacturing, installation and maintenance.
With its technological leadership, global expertise, and local presence, Nexans operates around the
world to satisfy essential needs while maintaining the highest levels of safety and performance.
Nexans is listed on the Paris stock exchange.

**MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN**

_“Our goals are to accelerate Nexans’ business growth and make the company more profitable, more_
_resistant, and more streamlined. And our recent performance proves that we can translate these goals_
_into tangible results.”_

**AHEAD OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN**

**Excellent 2006 results**
2006 was the company’s best year by far, with healthy sales growth and a sharp jump in profits. These
results reflect a buoyant economic climate, especially in our energy cables business which is enjoying
vibrant demand across the globe. These results are also the fruit of our aggressive, targeted growth
strategy designed to boost the company’s profitability and increase sales faster than the sector average.
We have made Nexans a more resistant company, cut its fixed costs, made its plants more efficient,
and expanded its product range. We also enlarged its footprint by expanding into the most dynamic,
lucrative markets in rapidly-developing regions such as South America, i.e. in Brazil, and the Middle
East. We increased our presence in Asia-Pacific substantially with the acquisition of Olex, the region’s
leading cable manufacturer. We created organizations that are closer to our customers and stepped-up
our R&D spending. And perhaps most significantly, we were able to maintain margins despite the


-----

skyrocketing prices of copper and plastics that make up over half of the manufacturing costs of our
cables – by passing on those increases and continuously lowering our costs.
We achieved the goals of our 2005-2007 strategic plan one year ahead of schedule. Nexans’ sales grew
an average of 6.7% between 2005 and 2006, the operating margin climbed to 5.8%, and the after-tax
ROCE improved substantially.

**A new Strategic Plan for 2007-2009**
In 2007 we will embark on a new three-year strategic plan that was approved by the Board of
Directors on January 17, 2007. This new plan will allow Nexans to accelerate its business growth, and
become more profitable, more resistant, and more streamlined.
Energy will be at the core of our business development, and our strategy is built around our energy
infrastructure, industry, and building businesses. We will be more targeted in the telecom activity by
focusing on higher value-added cables and systems. In the electrical wires and wire rods activities, we
plan to shift towards manufacturing to supply only the company’s own needs.
We target consolidated sales approaching 5 billion euros by 2009 (at constant metal prices), which
corresponds to an average annual growth rate of 6%, excluding acquisitions and scaled-down
businesses.
This sales growth will require an increasing amount of financial and human resources. We plan to
invest in capacity upgrades, enrich our product range, and penetrate new markets. 500 million euros
will be allocated to manufacturing capital expenditures between 2007 and 2009, of which 80% will be
spent on three priority areas: energy infrastructure, industry, and buildings.
Our operating margin target for 2009 is 7.5%, with a ROCE close to 13% (at 2006 copper prices). To
get there, we plan to focus on driving sales from higher-margin businesses, growing sales to the
industrial markets, boosting profitability, and striving to better understand and meet our customers’
needs.

**A well-understood, well-received strategy**
Our strategy has met with support from investors. Nexans’ share price soared 142% in 2006, making it
the best performers in the SBF 120. Our business outlook is very positive. There is still substantial
room to progress, and our sound financial structure puts us in a position to seize promising
opportunities.
Nexans operates in an industry oriented towards the future, with large, diversified, and sustainably
profitable markets. We aim to make the most of this, while serving the best interests of our
shareholders, employees and customers.

_** Yves Lyon-Caen notified the Board of Directors Meeting on March 27, 2007 of his decision to step_
_down from the Board in order to pursue other opportunities outside the Group. His departure will take_
_effect at the conclusion of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting on May 10, 2007._

**Proposals submitted to the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on May 10, 2007**
**(held upon second call)**

**Renewal of Directors term of office**
A resolution will be presented to the Shareholders for the renewal of Gianpaolo Caccini, Jean-Marie
Chevalier, Georges Chodron de Courcel, Jacques Garaïalde and Ervin Rosenberg as Directors for a 4
year term to terminate on the holding of the Shareholders’ Meeting convened to consider the accounts
for the financial year ending on 31[st] December 2010.

**Election of new Directors**
A resolution will also be presented to the Shareholders for the election of Jérôme Gallot, Jean-Louis
Gerondeau and Nicolas de Tavernost (whose details are provided below) as Directors for a 4 year
term, to terminate on the holding of the Shareholders’ Meeting convened to consider the accounts for
the financial year ending on 31[st] December 2010. Nexans does not have any significant business
relationships with these nominees or with the groups of which they are also Directors. The nominees
are therefore considered to be independent with regard to Nexans.

During the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, shareholders will be asked to renew the Board
Member terms of office of Gianpaolo Caccini, Georges Chodron de Courcel, Jacques Garaïalde, Ervin
Rosenberg, and Jean-Marie Chevalier for another four years, and to appoint the following three Board

**Operations of the Board of Directors**
Since its listing on the stock exchange, Nexans has adopted a number of rules relating to corporate
governance with a view to ensuring transparency of information with respect to both its directors and
its shareholders.
The Board of Directors is currently made up of 11 members. They come from diverse backgrounds
and were selected for their expertise and experience in industry, banking, or consultancy, enabling
them to give informed opinions and advice in the best interests of the Company.
The Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of June 3, 2004 decided to reduce the length of Directors’ term
of office from six years to four years, starting with terms beginning during the 2004 financial year.
No category of shareholder is represented on the Board of Directors, and no Director is elected by the
employees.
Once again this year, the Board of Directors has followed the recommendations of the combined
Viénot-Bouton Report of June 2003, and at its January 30, 2007 meeting reviewed the situation of
each of its members with regard to the criteria governing independence defined in the Report as
reflected in the Company’s Internal Regulations. The latter specifies in particular that in the Group’s
relations with businesses and banks in which any of its directors have an interest, independence will be
determined according to the level of sales made to such companies, which is fixed at 10%, or in
respect of investment banks and financial share of business given to them. The aim is to determine
whether these relationships are of an importance and nature such that they could affect the
independence and freedom of judgement of the directors concerned.
Based on these criteria, the Board of Directors determined that Gianpaolo Caccini, Jean-Marie
Chevalier, Jacques Garaïalde, Colette Lewiner, Yves Lyon-Caen, Patrick Puy, François Polge de
Combret, and Jean-Louis Vinciguerra should be considered to be independent Directors.
The Board of Directors determined that the other Directors were not independent: Gérard Hauser, in
view of his position as Chairman and CEO of the Company, and Georges Chodron de Courcel and
Ervin Rosenbrg, owing to their positions within BNP Paribas and La Compagnie Financière Edmond
de Rothschild Banque, which are two banks with whom the Group has business relationships.
Eight out of the eleven directors are therefore independent, representing more than half of the Board
members, a proportion in accordance with the recommendations of the Viénot-Bouton Report.
There are no family links between the Board members, and there are no service contracts between any
of the Board members and the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
No loans or guarantees have been granted or established for the benefit of a corporate officer by the
Company or a company within its Group.
Proceedings have been started against Patrick Puy further to the placing in official receivership of the
Moulinex-Brandt group of which he was one of the main Directors in the 10 months before it was
placed in receivership. To date, Mr Puy has not been found guilty of any offenses.
To the best knowledge of the Company, during the past five years:
– no Board member has been convicted of fraud;


-----

– no other Board member has been associated with any bankruptcy, placing into receivership, or
liquidation of a company;
– no other Board member has been the subject of an incrimination or official public sanction by any
statutory or regulatory authorities;

– no Board member has been prohibited by court order from serving on an administrative, executive,
or supervisory body of a public company, or from participating in the management of business of a
public company.

**Absence of conflicts of interest**
As mentioned above, some Board members serve as corporate officers and/or executives for
companies that may enter into contractual agreements with Nexans for commercial and/or financial
transactions (as investment advisors and/or managers). Such contracts having been negotiated and
signed under normal conditions, the Company is not aware of any possible conflicts of interest
between the Board members’ duties towards Nexans and their private interests and/or any of their
other obligations. Apart from the related-party transactions discussed on pages 203 to 205 of this
Prospectus, no agreements or arrangements have been concluded with the primary shareholders,
customers, suppliers, or other parties, under the terms of which a Board member has been selected.
Board members are not subject to any restrictions on the sale of their ownership interest in Nexans’
capital, with the exception of any regulations governing insider trading.

**Compensation of Board Members**
The Board of Directors Meeting on March 27, 2007 approved the following changes to the methods
for setting and paying the Directors’ fees described in the Management Report Presented by the Board
of Directors on pages 85 and 86 of this Prospectus:

- Each Director, including the Chairman, will receive a fixed portion of 17,500 euros;

- Each Director, including the Chairman, will receive an additional 2,000 euros for each Board
meeting attended, with a maximum of 12,000 euros per Director;

- Each member of the Accounts and Audit Committee will receive 3,000 euros per Committee meeting
attended, with a maximum of 12,000 euros; and

- Each member of the Appointments and Compensation Committee will receive 3,000 euros per
Committee meeting attended, with a maximum of 12,000 euros.

**Additional Information**
Additional information regarding the Board of Directors, its various Committees, and Nexans’
executives are given in the Management Report Presented by the Board of Directors on pages 82 to 88
of this Prospectus, and in the Chairman’s Report on the Board of Directors’ Operations and the
Company’s Internal Control Procedures on pages 206 to 218 of this Prospectus.

**+4%**

in millions of euros
2004 2005 2006
4,005 4,263 4,442

Sales at current non-ferrous metals prices increased by 37%, as the company was able to successfully
pass the jump in copper prices through to its customers.

At constant non-ferrous metals prices, sales climbed 4.2%, or 8.2% at constant perimeter and
exchange rates, given the sale of the distribution business at the start of the year. Business was
particularly dynamic for power cables, where sales surged 11.3% at constant perimeter and exchange
rates, fuelled by strong demand around the world.

**Operating margin[(3)]**

2004 2005 2006
133 186 260
3.3%[(5)] 4.4%[(5)] 5.8%[(5)]

Operating margin bounded 40%, thanks to the impact of operating leverage on the company’s higher
sales, the rapid growth of high value-added businesses, and continued cost reductions, most notably in
Europe and in the Telecom activities.

**Net investments[(3)]**
**+38%**

2004 2005 2006
78 120 165

The company’s net investments rose 38% in 2006, increasing for the second year in a row. Half of the
investments were related to manufacturing equipment maintenance, and half to development
programmes, primarily in the Energy activities (infrastructure, industry, and buildings).

**Shareholders’ equity[(2)]**
**+24%**

2004 2005 2006

Shareholders’ equity increased during the year following the appropriation of 244 million euros of net
profit, and the conversion into equity of 117 million euros of Nexans’ 3.125% OCEANE convertible
bonds. The company’s leverage (net debt-to-equity ratio) now stands at a comfortable 40%.

**Net debt[(2)]**
**+69%**

2004 2005 2006
295 374 633

Net debt grew by 259 million euros, primarily as a result of the surge in copper prices which led to an
estimated 270 million euro increase in the company’s working capital requirements. Nexans financed
its acquisitions (including that of the Australian company Olex) through the sale of its distribution
business and the conversion of its 3.125% OCEANE convertible bonds, thus enabling it to maintain a
healthy balance sheet.

**+15%**

**STRATEGY AND GOALS**
**The new 2007-2009 strategic plan**

**A more profitable, resistant and focused company**
Nexans reached the goals of its 2005-2007 strategic plan one year ahead of schedule, and in January
presented the Board of Directors with its new plan for 2007-2009.

This new plan was developed after an in-depth review of the company’s businesses, which analyzed
each one in terms of its profitability and growth potential, business cycle, and competitive positioning.

Nexans has set itself four key goals for 2009:
� Increase profitability;
� Capitalize on long-term business cycles markets;
� Focus on a smaller number of businesses and market segments
� Develop more synergies between activities

**Energy infrastructure, industry, and buildings: the core activities of Nexans’ strategy**
Nexans is a global player in infrastructure, industry, and buildings, and plans to focus its future
business development on the energy sector.

The company will strengthen its position in the energy infrastructure market by offering an enhanced
range of products, penetrating new, profitable regional markets, and promoting a customer-focused
culture among its employees.

�The infrastructure **market** offers unprecedented prospects for expansion in every region of the
world. Power networks and transportation networks are benefiting from major modernization
programs in developed countries as well as a boom in emerging countries. The average annual


-----

investment in energy production, transmission, and distribution between 2001 and 2030 is predicted to
be around 530 billion dollars[(2)].

�The industry market, which is tied closely to global economic growth, is benefiting from buoyant
activity in many sectors. Nexans has selected eight priority segments on which to focus its efforts:
petrochemicals, nuclear energy, railway equipment, automobiles, shipbuilding, material handling,
robotics, and electronics. The company has also set up specific sales organizations and technical
support teams to better penetrate and serve each of these market segments.

� **The building market is being fuelled by an upbeat climate in Europe, despite a temporary**
slowdown in North America. In rapidly-developing countries, this market offers Nexans a base from
which it can expand into other markets.

**Telecom infrastructure and Local Area Networks: complementary activities and targeted**
**business development**
� **In telecommunications networks, Nexans’ strategy will be based on promoting high-performing,**
copper cable solutions for xDSL applications[(3)]. The company’s optical fibers cable operations will be
targeted towards niche markets, consistent with the small market share Nexans has in most
applications. Its efforts will focus on a dedicated offer for FTTH[(4) ]which provide high-speed internet
connections.

� **In LAN[(5)] markets, Nexans synergies are limited by the fact that this market requires a regional**
business strategy. Therefore, the company will use a selective approach backed by high value-added
products and services.

**Electrical wires and wirerods: upstream operations to supply the company**
Nexans’ electrical wires and wirerod operations allow it to control the quality of its supplies. However,
due to the jump in copper prices, these operations now incur very high costs which have not been fully
offset by the margins on sales to outside customers. Therefore Nexans has decided to gradually
streamline these operations so that they eventually serve to supply only the company.

**Goals for 2009[(6)]**
In light of the growing percentage of sales of higher value-added products, the profitable revenue
growth in the industry market, and the continued, successful restructuring efforts, Nexans has set four
main goals to be realized by 2009 – the final year of its new strategic plan (at constant perimeter and

� Positive cash flow (after capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and dividends) starting in
2008. This includes planned capital expenditures of 500 million euros over three years, 30 million
euros per year of restructuring costs, and a dividend payout of 30% of earnings from continuing
operations.

The company’s expected sales growth will require considerable financial and human resources.
Nexans plans to invest over 500 million euros in its manufacturing facilities between 2007 and 2009,
of which over 400 million euros will be spent in three priority areas: energy infrastructure, industry,
and buildings.

**NB: for 2007, Nexans aims an increase in sales at constant metal prices of approximately 4% (taking**
into account the decision to reduce its exposure to the electrical wires sector), an improvement in its
operating margin (the level of which is always difficult to determine at the beginning of the year), and
a neutral cash flow[(7)] situation.

**2006 RESULTS BY BUSINESS[(8)]**

**ENERGY CABLES**

- **67% of Group sales (up 11.3% from 2005)**

- **90% of Group operating margin (up 47% from 2005)**

**Positions**
Nexans has excellent market positions in the energy networks markets in Europe and North America,
and in Asia-Pacific following the 2006 Olex acquisition. The company is a global leader in
shipbuilding, railway, and petrochemical cables.

**2006 results**
Sales in the energy business reached 2,983 million euros in 2006, representing an organic growth of
11.3%. The Olex acquisition was neutral at December 31, 2006 because Olex was consolidated into
the Group on this date. The energy business’ operating margin surged 47% to 233 million euros in
2006. Sales of high-voltage submarine and umbilical cables were very strong.
In the building market, price increases and buoyant demand allowed the company to improve its
profitability. The residential segment remains strong in Europe, most notably in the Netherlands,
Spain, Greece, and Turkey, while in North America, higher prices offset a slowdown in volumes in the
second half. Industry cables continue to see profitability recover on the back of more sales to high
value-added segments, such as shipbuilding and offshore platforms. Finally, sales of automotive and
railway cable harnesses and cables for material handling, petrochemical, and nuclear market segments
remained solid.

**Trends**
Nexans is a global player in cables for infrastructure, industry, and buildings, and has decided to focus
its business development on energy applications.
� The energy infrastructure market has a solid outlook around the world, due to needs for network
reliability, modernization, development, and interconnection. Submarine high-voltage cables will be a
major growth driver as large-scale projects get underway. Soaring energy prices are encouraging
exploration deeper and further out, while energy needs and environmental regulations are prompting
investments in alternative energies, such as wind energy, which require complex cable systems.
Nexans is present in the entire value chain, and has made unquestionable technological advances in all
these applications.

� In the industry cables market, Nexans provides advanced solutions to eight priority segments:
petrochemicals, nuclear energy, railway automotive, shipbuilding, material handling, robotics, and
electronics.
� In the buildings market, Nexans is one step ahead of the expected changes in EU standards with
high-performing fire-resistant cables and fire-reaction cables.

**TELECOM CABLES**

- **14.5% of Group sales (up 1.7% from 2005)**

- **18.6% of Group operating margin (up 104% from 2005)**

**Positions**
Nexans is extremely well-positioned in Europe, especially in cables for public telecom networks, and
in LAN cables in the US. In high-growth Asian markets such as China, Korea, and Vietnam, the Group
has strengthened its market presence and boosted sales. And thanks to its performing products for
high-bandwidth transmission and connectivity, the Group also has a strong position in local loops,
ADSL, and xDSL technologies.

**2006 results**
Sales from the telecom business totaled 648 million euros in 2006, representing an organic growth rate
of 1.7%. Operating margin leapt 104% to 48.4 million euros, thanks to a more favorable product mix
and cost cutting efforts.
Sales of fiber cables were strong in Northern Europe due to expanding local loop networks, while
sales to profitable niche markets such as xDSL and TriplePlay continued to climb. However, sales of
cables for public networks slid in the wake of plunging demand for ADSL cables in Europe.
Sales volumes of LAN cables edged up slightly, but these products’ profitability improved
substantially in Europe following the company’s restructuring efforts, and in North America due to a
sales strategy focused on high value-added products.
In electronic cables for industry, demand remains vibrant in the aerospace and geophysics sectors.

**Trends**
In the telecom business, Nexans is continuing to implement a selective strategy focused on promoting
high-performing solutions.
� The booming market for high-speed internet access has prompted operators to invest in xDSL
networks able to meet growing user needs. Companies’ demand for broadband shows no signs of
slowing down, and the number of cable subscribers continues to multiply.
� Growth drivers for Nexans going forward include unbundling, co-existing and complementary
copper and fiber optics networks, local network expansion, second lines in European households for
internet access, and telecom infrastructure-building in developing countries. Nexans is well-positioned
in all these areas. The company is a member of FTTH Council Europe, an association promoting the
deployment of high-speed optical fiber networks throughout Europe, and has already developed a
complete set of cables, connectors, and cords in anticipation of future industry standards.

**ELECTRICAL WIRES**

- **18.1% of Group sales (up 3.1% from 2005)**

- **Negative Group operating margin**

Nexans mainly manufactures bare electrical wires, which are the base product of the cable industry. A
large portion of its production is used by the company’s cable manufacturing plants, which can ensure
the quality of their supply.
Winding wires are used as magnetic parts in engines, household appliances, cars, etc., and are sold to
mainly to parts suppliers in the automotive, railway, and aerospace sectors.
Nexans signed an agreement to sell this business in January 2007.


-----

**2006 results**
Sales from the electrical wires business rose 3.1% (at constant perimeter and exchange rates) to
802 million euros.
The wirerod business saw modest growth in demand from customers in Europe combined with a sharp
drop in demand from North America during the second half of the year.
In bare electrical wires, sales of commonplace products fell while sales of special products surged,
mainly in the automotive sector. Winding wire sales benefited from energy infrastructure investments
in Canada and China.
Operating margin from the electrical wires business decreased from 6 million euros in 2005 to a loss
of 4 million euros in 2006.

**Trends**
Nexans plans to gradually rationalize this business so that it eventually supplies only the company, in
order to reduce the company’s exposure to copper prices.

**OUR ACTIVITIES IN 2006[(9)]**
**GROWTH AND EXPANSION**

Against a backdrop of soaring raw materials and energy prices, Nexans secured its global leadership
position in the cable industry and boosted its operating and financial performance. The Group steppedup its manufacturing improvement program, continued to grow sales aggressively in the energy sector,
anchored its position in several priority market segments, and balanced its geographic footprint with
the acquisitions of Olex, the leading cable manufacturer in the Asia-Pacific region, Confecta, a Swiss
maker of high value-added harnesses for the railway industry, and The Valley Group in the United
States (in early 2007), a provider of real-time thermal rating technology for overhead power
transmission lines, as well as the creation of a joint venture in Japan with Viscas to manufacture highvoltage submarine cables.

**EUROPE[(10)]**

**Jump in sales and profitability**
68% of Nexans’ sales and 54% of its operating margin came from Europe. Sales in the region (11.4%
of which were outside France) jumped 8.5% in 2006 at constant perimeter and exchange rates, while
the operating margin bounded 38%.

**Economic climate**
Low-voltage cables for the building market enjoyed robust demand across Europe, especially in
France, Spain, and all the Nordic countries.
Strong demand for power cables, most notably for industry and infrastructure, largely offset sluggish
sales in the Telecom network business.
Nexans also benefited from medium- and high-voltage power network expansions related to a higher
level of cross-border connections between countries. Sales of submarine and umbilical cables were
driven by large interconnection projects and a dynamic oil and gas market, while sales of industry
cables and harnesses also picked up throughout the region.

**Improved performance**
Europe had a very good year 2006 in terms of sales and profits. The region benefited from a favorable
economy, which fuelled both domestic and international markets, more efficient, productive
manufacturing and logistics operations, and structured sales efforts, especially those targeted towards
Nexans’ priority segments that were chosen for their growth potential and high margins.
In January 2006, Nexans sold its distribution business in Switzerland for a gain of 149 million euros as
part of its strategy to focus on its core businesses.
Necessary capacity and productivity investments were made, along with restructurings at
manufacturing sites in France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. 48 million euros were provisioned in
2006 for the restructurings, and 112 million euros were spent to support the strong demand for highvoltage, medium-voltage, and umbilical cables for energy networks, as well as developments in the
company’s priority market segments.
2006 also saw Nexans complete a targeted acquisition with the purchase of Confecta, a leading Swiss
supplier of industrial harnesses for the railway and manufacturing sectors in Europe. Confecta
generated revenues of 27 million euros in 2006 and has 180 employees.

**Enhanced manufacturing operations and greater capacity**
Nexans carried out significant restructuring efforts in 2006. The company closed a
telecommunications cable plant in Opglabbeek, Belgium, and halted catenaries production at a plant in
Marseille, France. Railway harness operations at Nuremberg, Germany, were transferred to a site in
Hempsdorf, Germany, owned by Confecta, a specialist in these products. The production of LAN
cables at Abbey Wood, UK, was successfully transferred to Turkey due to fierce competition from
Chinese imports.

Nexans also made significant investments to boost the operating performance of all its plants.
Production capacity was increased in several areas, including automotive cables in Romania, cables
for the petrochemical market, and high-voltage submarine and umbilical cables in Norway; capacity at
the Halden, Norway, plant will grow by over 50% in 2007.


-----

In Japan, Nexans acquired a majority stake in a joint venture with Viscas, which will give it access to
the Japanese company’s high-voltage submarine cable production plant in Tokyo Bay – one of the
best-equipped manufacturing facilities in the world for these types of products.
Indeed, to further serve the booming submarine cable market, Nexans made a strategic move by
purchasing the cable-laying vessel C/S Nexans Skagerrak. Submarine cable installation is often
included in the company’s supply contracts, and there are only two ships in the world that can do this
profitably while meeting technical specifications. Now that Nexans now owns rather than leases one
of them, it is even-better-positioned to profit from the expected market growth.

**New records in high-voltage submarine cables**
In 2006, Nexans’ Halden plant saw record orders from Europe, the US, Africa, the Middle East, and
China. The year was once again filled with worldwide technological breakthroughs in high-voltage
submarine cables.
One of Nexans’ innovations was Uflex, a state-of-the-art software package that allows its engineers to
accurately predict the stress and fatigue behavior of the complex umbilical cables that they design and
install for oil and gas fields.

**Robust sales for the building market and power distribution networks**
Sales of medium-voltage cables and accessories for power distribution networks continued to climb in
2006, and Nexans made substantial logistics improvements in order to better use its full production
capacity to supply several countries. For example, Sweden, which is in the process of burying its
power lines following the large storm in January 2005, was supplied by Nexans manufacturing sites in
Norway, France, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece. In the United Kingdom, utilities are upgrading their
medium-voltage power networks ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games.
Sales of low-voltage cables for the building market rose sharply on higher volumes combined with
favorable prices.

**Stronger market position in special cables**
Nexans’ special cables, manufactured in Germany, France, Switzerland, and Sweden, had an excellent
year thanks to positive momentum in many strategic segments, including oil and gas, nuclear power,
material handling, robotics, automotive, shipbuilding, railway, and fire safety.
In fact, in the area of fire safety, Nexans is already prepared for the new European Commission
Construction Products Directive (CPD), which will set new fire reaction and fire-resistance standards
for all cables. In 2005, the company launched a new range of halogen-free cables with improved fire
reaction properties, ALSECURE[®], and a range of fire-resistant cables that ensure the continued
operation of safety systems during emergency conditions, ALSECURE[®] PLUS. These new products
were introduced in France, Benelux, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden. In 2006, a customized range of
ALSECURE[®] cables was developed for and launched in the United Kingdom, which has a particularly
strong yet demanding market for safety cables.

**Outlook**
Going forward, Nexans will be able to rely on manufacturing facilities optimized to serve the major
European markets, an extensive range of products and services, and a proactive sales organization
ready to seize the many opportunities offered by an enlarged Europe and export markets.
Several capacity increases are either underway or planned within the next three years to supply the
surging demand, whether it be for high-voltage submarine and umbilical cables in Norway, power
accessories in Germany, or special cables and harnesses in Eastern Europe. Nexans also plans to
increase its production capacity for halogen-free materials and copper recycling.

**Economic climate**
In 2006, Nexans benefited from a buoyant economy across North America. The power network
business in Canada in particular had a solid year. However, the company’s electrical wires business
was hurt by a slowdown in North American demand in the second half.
The buildings business in the US also posted a weak second half, although prices remained high.
Demand in the shipbuilding and aerospace market segments held up well, while that for power cables
grew substantially thanks to transmission and distribution network upgrades and large interconnection
projects between the United States and Canada.
In the telecom business, Nexans enjoyed healthy demand which helped drive sales of its high valueadded LAN cables.

**A very good year**
All of Nexans’ North American businesses posted solid results in 2006, except for electrical wires. In
power cables, profitability increased substantially. Sales also pushed ahead in low-voltage cables for
the building market, despite a dip in volumes in the second half. However, local network cables saw
overall sales decline, although sales of higher value-added products climbed and helped lift profits.
The LAN optical fiber cables business continued to push ahead and improve profitability through the
use of new manufacturing technologies. In shipbuilding and aerospace market segments, sales leapt
12% in the face of stiff competition. Sales of high-technology cables made in Nexans’ European and
Asian plants exceeded 80 million euros; these products are destined primarily for the petrochemical
industry, shipbuilders, power utilities, and robotics applications.

**Increased production capacity**
Nexans installed a new production line to manufacture aerospace cables for Airbus at its Elm City
plant in North Carolina. The company will also able to offer a wider range of residential and industrial

(11) Canada, the United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.

building cables, thanks to investments made in 2005 and 2006 at its Fergus, Canada, and Chester, US,
plants.

**Outlook**
The outlook for the North American market remains buoyant, and Nexans plans to strengthen its
position in the region. The company plans to focus on supplying cables for power networks, as energy
utilities will be making sizable investments in the near future to upgrade their distribution and
interconnection grids so as to comply with the 2005 Energy Act.
Sales of cables for telecom Local Area Networks should continue to climb and shift towards higherend products offering advanced bandwidth.
In 2007, Nexans will finally reap the benefits of the capacity enhancements it undertook in 2005 and
2006 that were aimed to expand the range of residential and industrial building cables it sells in the
North American market.

**ASIA-PACIFIC[(12)]**

**A surge in profitability and a greater presence**
Not including the Olex acquisition[(13)], the Asia-Pacific region accounted for 6.3% of Nexans’ sales and
7% of its operating margin in 2006. At constant perimeter and exchange rates, sales in the region grew
6.3% and the operating margin grew by 62%.

**Economic climate**
The developing Asian economies continued to grow at a healthy pace, which translated into strong
demand for cables in all markets amid fierce competition. However, Nexans could not benefit fully
from this positive climate due to difficulties in offsetting the higher copper prices, particularly in
China and Vietnam. In the developed countries, Australia saw continued hefty investments in
telecoms, industry, buildings, and power networks.

**Doubled presence in the region**
Nexans’ production sites in China, South Korea, Japan, and Vietnam export to other ASEAN
countries, Australia, Oceania, and Eastern Russia. The Group strengthened its manufacturing and sales

(12) South-East Asia, Australia, China, South Korea, India, Japan, New Zealand, Oceania, Vietnam.

resources in the region with the purchase of Olex, the leading power cable maker in Australia and the
Asia-Pacific, and a new joint venture formed in Japan with Viscas to manufacture high-voltage
submarine cables (Nexans is the majority owner with a 66% stake). Through these strategic
transactions, Nexans has doubled its presence in the Asia-Pacific. In addition, the Group reinforced its
manufacturing operations in Vietnam by opening a third plant, jointly-owned with another company, to
make low- and medium-voltage power cables, and industrial and equipment cables.

**The high value-added choice**
In order to face heavy price pressure, Nexans decided to focus on high value-added segments such as
shipbuilding, automotive, railway, and telecommunications.
For example, in China, sales of telecom cables for Local Area Networks and special cables
skyrocketed, as did sales of shipbuilding and material handling cables manufactured at Nexans’
Shanghai plant that opened in 2005.
In Korea, Kukdong Electrical Wires saw robust sales growth in shipbuilding cables, an area where
Nexans is a global market leader. Kukdong’s other two plants manufacture power cables for buildings
and medium-voltage grids, telecom cables, and cables for the booming automotive market.

**Outlook**
Nexans’ sales in the Asia-Pacific region should continue to climb as the company focuses on hightechnology, high value-added products, and leverages its enhanced manufacturing and sales resources
following the Olex acquisition and capacity increase in Japan.
China, which will host the 2008 Olympic Games and 2010 World Expo in Shanghai, is accelerating its
investments in all areas including energy distribution, telecommunications, and transportation. The
development of high-speed trains, construction and expansion of around 100 airports, and programs in
shipbuilding and civil nuclear power all offer significant opportunities for Nexans.
The Group plans to increase its production capacity in China for high value-added telecom and LAN
cables, and reinforce its operations in Vietnam for both the domestic and export markets.

**OTHER REGIONS[(14)]**

**Encouraging results in a rapidly-growing region**
The Rest of the World region accounted for 7.4% of Nexans’ sales and 14.2% of its operating margin
in 2006. At constant perimeter and exchange rates, sales in the region soared 17% and the operating
margin leapt 48%.

**Economic climate**
The Rest of the World region comprises South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and the
Former Soviet Republics. Many countries in this region contributed to Nexans’ revenue growth in
2006, including Morocco, Turkey, and Lebanon. The abundant oil and gas resources owned by
countries in the Middle East and Central Asia have enabled them to accelerate their industrialization
efforts and energy and communications network interconnections – large projects in which Nexans is
actively involved.

**Stepped-up capacity in Morocco, Turkey, and Brazil**
Sales in Morocco skyrocketed, fuelled by vibrant demand for power transformers and cables for
energy networks, buildings, and automotive – all areas in which Nexans has stepped-up its
manufacturing capacity.
In Turkey, production multiplied following the transfer of operations from the UK and Ireland, while
sales proved robust thanks to dynamic residential and export markets. The company also made
capacity investments for energy cables.
Nexans continued to enrich its product offer in Brazil. The manufacture of copper power, building, and
industry cables started in early 2007 and will round out the existing production of telecom and
aluminum overhead power cables.

**Refocused manufacturing in Lebanon and Egypt**
Liban Câbles was able to grow sales and maintain excellent profitability in 2006, despite the political
turmoil and war which gripped the country. Its manufacturing facilities were oriented towards
producing power cables and special cables for the oil and gas industry. The same transition was made
at the ICC plant in Egypt. Exports from Lebanon to the Gulf countries and Russia grew markedly and
most of the Egypt plant’s exports were sent to Eastern Africa. In 2006 Nexans signed an agreement
with East African Cable, whose sales network extends across the entire Great Lakes area.

**Outlook**
Nexans has considerable potential in these countries, and has focused its operations on the most
profitable sectors: energy production and distribution, oil and gas, automotive, railway, and buildings.
The company enjoys sizable market share in each large region, and has made capacity investments and
increased their export potential.
The outlook remains positive in South America and Russia, and is especially promising in the Middle
East. The six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council plan to establish a single market by 2008 and
a single currency by 2010, and inject 700 billion dollars into their economies between 2006 and
2010[(15)]. These investments will be allocated among the hydrocarbon sector, infrastructure
development, and real estate.
Meanwhile, Nexans’ first plant in Russia for manufacturing power network cables should be up and
running by the end of 2007. The company also plans to enhance its high-performing, competitive
manufacturing facilities for the automotive industry in Morocco and for power, petrochemical, and
halogen-free cables in Turkey.

…Nexans has strengthened its outlook for growth and performance.

**UNDERSTAND AND SATISFY OUR CUSTOMERS**

Nexans innovates continuously in order to maintain its technological leadership, become more
competitive, and consistently add value for its customers. The Group has set up new R&D
organizations designed to better predict and more fully satisfy its customers’ needs.

**A global R&D organization…**
Organized globally, present locally, Nexans is up-do-date with both national and international
standards, and is a major player in international standards-setting. The Nexans Research Center
(NRC), which partners with renowned universities and research institutions, makes use of advantages
in fundamental research. Its employees in Lyon and Nuremberg work on researching and improving
cable components (sheath, conductor, and insulation).
Nexans’ applied research is conducted in eight Competence Centers focused on the Group’s core
businesses and specialized by product or technology. They are located in Europe and North America,
with their research applied around the world, and have 15 specialized test and trial laboratories.
Nexans’ Technical Management Department coordinates the sharing of technological advancements
across the Group, and ensures that managers meet on a regular basis.

**… serving our customers**
Optimizing designs, providing simplicity through innovation, enhancing products’ technical
performance, cutting costs, and speeding time-to-market are permanent goals. The main research areas
are: polymer properties for insulation and sheath compounds, to improve cable reliability in complex
or extreme environments; fire-resistant and flame-retardant properties for low- and medium-voltage
cables; and weight and volume reduction for aerospace, space, and automotive applications. Most of
the Group’s inventions are patent-protected.

**Recognized technological leadership**
Nexans is at the leading edge of many of tomorrow’s technologies.
For example, in power cables, Nexans is a benchmark in high-temperature superconductivity, highvoltage submarine cables, umbilical cables for offshore platforms, cabling systems for wind energy
production and distribution, etc. In 2006, the Group introduced a system that protects power lines
against electricity robberies and a superconducting current limiter that safeguards medium-voltage
power lines, so as to avoid any possible domino effect that could lead to a major outage.
In telecoms, Nexans offers systems including micro-blown optical fiber cables, high-bandwidth LAN
cables, and plastic optical fiber for Fiber-to-the-Home applications.

For industrial applications, Nexans offers a series of innovative cables and cabling systems, including
extremely high-temperature cables for automotives and reliable material handling solutions
incorporating powerful and fast-moving trolleys, cranes, and loading systems. In 2006, Nexans
developed the DuoTrack, a duplex copper/optical fiber data cable used in railway signaling. The
DuoTrack is robust, cost-effective, and easy to lay along railways. As another example, Nexans
developed a highly resistant cable for high-speed industrial cameras.

**Innovation in step with customer needs**
Nexans strives to develop solutions the value of which is recognized by customers and offers decisive
advantages. The Group’s new R&D organization puts customers at the core of its efforts, in order to
better understand their needs, speed time-to-market for new innovations, and offer new services.


-----

In 2006, Nexans created a team of Customer Technical Interface (CTI) technicians to serve customers
in the automotive, rolling stock, material handling, and shipbuilding market segments. These
technicians are familiar with all the Group’s R&D resources, and visit customer sites with Global
Product Managers in order to pinpoint customers’ needs and develop effective solutions more quickly.
CTI technicians serve as the communication interface between customers’ technical teams and
Nexans’ R&D staff. With this approach, Nexans can enhance its proposals, adapt its R&D efforts to
changes in customers’ plans and requirements, and undertake joint development projects with
customers to innovate in step with their needs.
Nexans also bolstered the synergies among its sales, marketing, and R&D staff by initiating special
Technical Days and Global Product Manager meetings, which allow employees to discuss customers’
requests and the customized solutions they developed.

**Specialized application centers**
Nexans is a technology partner to its customers, and relies on an in-depth understanding of their
applications to provide solutions that boost performance and lower costs. Several Group’s production
sites have application centers that refine and test cables under actual-use conditions. Two new
applications centers were built in 2006, one for automation systems in Nuremberg, Germany, and one
for material handling in Lyon, France, which come in addition to one for LANs in New Holland, USA,
and one for xDSL in Santander, Spain. These centers are largely open to Nexans’ customers wishing to
test their equipment. They speed time-to-market, enable comparative trials, and prove that Nexans’
cables and cabling systems effectively meet – and often exceed – customers’ expectations.

Innovation at Nexans goes beyond technology and extends into customer service as well, whether for
offering design assistance, ready-to-install cables and harnesses, optimized inventory management and
logistics chains, or full cable recycling platforms.

-----

**Predicting human resources needs**
To drive its growth and prepare for the future, Nexans supports its employees by helping them develop
skills in line with the company’s needs and encouraging manager mobility.
Nexans’ Human Resources Department sets common policies and procedures and coordinates certain
issues such as manager career development, compensation policies, workplace safety, employee access
to IT systems, and performance reviews.
The Group is also managing its future skills needs and career paths more effectively. It has set up a
Group-level Career Management Committee and encourages country divisions to set up similar
Committees. Nexans also promotes annual performance reviews for each employee.

**Attracting talent and encouraging mobility**
Recruitment is another of the company’s growth drivers. Nexans hired 3,086 employees in 2006,
preferring young graduates able to work in an international environment. It also strengthened its
central marketing and finance staff and its pool of future managers through an emphasis on local
recruitment. Nexans increased its presence and recruitment efforts at major engineering schools,
especially in Norway and the US.
The company also favors internal promotions and employee mobility. In 2007, all available
managerial positions will be accessible online through a job database centralizing the open jobs in
each country.

**Promoting training and facilitating knowledge transfer**
Training enables each employee to improve his or her performance and build the skills needed to make
the Group’s strategy a success. It encourages and facilitates the sharing of best practices, and unites
employees around common values, goals, and methods.
Nexans sponsored a fourth executive training program in 2006, which was led by the European School
of Management (ESCP-EAP) and the Group’s senior managers. Nexans also set up a management
training program for supervisors and technicians in the Asia region, and continued to roll out
the Sales+ program to its 650 sales men and women around the world. Finally, Nexans decided to
open a Nexans University designed to promote the Nexans Way internationally, in all the main fields
of management. The Group recruited a Director at the end of 2006 to spearhead this project.

**Workplace health and safety: a focus on prevention**
Nexans is committed to protecting its employees’ health and safety, and has processes in place to make
sure that all the equipment and installations at each site are completely secure. The Group has
implemented programs with high standards. For example, the Denizli and Tuzla plants in Turkey
obtained OHSAS 18001 certification for their safety management system. In Norway, the _HMS i_
_Hundre program targets zero accidents by the Nexans Norway 100th anniversary in 2015 (compared_
with 12.5 accidents in 2005). This program was launched through a major information campaign
designed to increase employees’ safety awareness in all their activities, both at work and at home. The
number of accidents at Nexans Norway has already dropped 32% since 2005.
These efforts have succeeded in decreasing the number of workplace accidents across the Group by
around 10% in 2006.

**An open labor dialogue**
Through Newco, the Nexans European Work Council representing 13 countries, the Group maintains
an open dialogue with labor union representatives. Newco meets twice a year. In 2006, discussions
were centered primarily on the acceleration of the company’s manufacturing improvement program
and its implications for employees, as well as the Group’s strategic plan.
When Nexans is required to restructure its operations, it helps employees find new jobs either within
or outside the company by offering training and personalized support if needed. For example, in 2006
Nexans signed an agreement with labor unions in Germany to safeguard threatened jobs by increasing
the number of working hours per week and scaling back salary hikes.


-----

**An attractive compensation policy**
Building employees’ commitment involves implementing an attractive, coherent compensation policy,
which Nexans has established in a spirit of transparency and fairness while taking into account the
local conditions at each site.
Manager compensation is made up of a fixed salary plus a variable bonus tied to goals set at the start
of the year; some of these goals are linked to the Group’s financial performance. Sales people are also
eligible for a profit-sharing scheme and a bonus tied to their entity’s results.
Almost all of Nexans’ French subsidiaries have set up employee profit-sharing plans, and many of its
international subsidiaries have similar programs depending on the regulations in effect in each country.
Finally, Nexans offered stock options to certain managers who are not on the Executive Committee,
and in 2006 introduced a new, worldwide employee share ownership plan.

**BOOST OUR EFFICIENCY**

Nexans strives to improve the efficiency of its day-to-day operations and share the benefits with its
customers, which are its partners in performance. The Group has become more responsive and more
competitive, with higher-quality products, streamlined logistics, optimized purchasing processes, and
enhanced manufacturing facilities.

**Optimized purchasing**
Purchases represent more than 80% of Nexans’ sales and a huge opportunity for savings, which it
plans to realize by increasing the percentage of centralized purchases.
The Group’s main purchases are raw materials (e.g., copper, aluminum, and plastics), energy,
components, and transportation services. In addition, Nexans has signed long-term contracts with
leading global copper producers in order to secure its copper supply.

**Competitive manufacturing facilities**
A lot of Nexans’ plants manufacture products sold around the world. The other sites are located as
close as possible to the markets they serve. The Group is continuously improving its manufacturing
and logistics operations in an effort to control costs and adjust to structural changes in demand. It has
specialized plants in developed countries, and is building capacity in Eastern Europe, North Africa,
Brazil, China, and other Asian countries to meet the booming demand in these markets and serve large,
multinational customers. In Europe, Nexans accelerated its restructuring plan which allowed the
Group to reduce committed capital and to cut fix costs. The full impact of these measures should be
seen in 2008. At the same time, Nexans stepped-up its investment spending. Around 300 million euros
will be invested at its plants in 2006 and 2007 (excluding acquisitions), in capacity increases and in
productivity improvements.

**Better operating performance**
Nexans has undertaken continuous improvement programs in all its operations – manufacturing with
Program+, logistics with ASAP (recently completed by a new program: Service+), and sales with
Sales+.
The main goal of Program+ is to lower costs while increasing customer satisfaction, which requires a
substantial personal effort on the part of Nexans employees. Company databases, communication
networks, and seminars will enhance the sharing of best practices and innovations in key areas.
Guidelines will soon be compiled so that each plant can perform a self-evaluation and prioritize its
focus areas for improvement.

In 2006, plant managers from 23 countries met for two days in a conference aimed at sharing ideas for
a model plant. The managers learned about new process optimization applications – including a
modeling application developed by Nexans R&D to improve machine operations – designed to help
plant managers meet their manufacturing challenges.

**Sell more, serve better**
At sites all over the world, Nexans has made its processes more reliable, become more flexible, and
invested in systems that enable more efficient inventory management, lower working capital
requirements, and better customer service. Nexans’ sales force benefits from an array of methods for
improving sales efficiency and boosting performance, taken from best practices within the Group and
other companies and implemented primarily through the Sales+ program and applications. The Group
also appointed country Sales Developers to help the sales force seize opportunities in priority markets
more quickly and as often as they arise.

In order to provide the best service possible, from order processing to customer delivery, Nexans has
appointed Supply Chain Managers who coordinate production schedules, procurement, inventory


-----

management, and shipping. They aim to help build customer loyalty by ensuring customers receive
exactly what they want on the promised delivery date, a statistic measured through the On Time In
Full (OTIF) performance indicator. Changes in this indicator along with customer complaints (for
whatever reason) are the first things studied by Nexans’ committees responsible for improving
customer satisfaction.

Nexans has also appointed Key Account Managers in an effort to simplify and strengthen its
relationships with its largest customers, whose needs are often diverse and span several countries.
These Key Account Managers offer global solutions and coordinate the operations of sales teams and
technical staff.

**PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT[(17)]**

Nexans has stepped-up its efforts to preserve the environment, control its consumption of energy,
water and materials, and facilitate product recycling. The Group works alongside its customers to
provide solutions that enhance the safety of both people and their property, respect the landscape and
marine life, and encourage the use of clean and renewable energy.

**Optimized product design and manufacturing processes**
Nexans develops products to meet customers’ needs with a minimal impact on the environment over
the entire product cycle, and to facilitate disposal when materials have reached the end of their useful
lives. This includes eliminating lead stabilizers in PVC sheaths, halogens, and solvents, selecting nonpolluting materials that are more easily recyclable, and designing systems in such a way that materials
and components can be easily separated.
In-depth research is performed to ensure the durability and resistance of Nexans’ products in
challenging environments, such as large depths, extreme climates, corrosion, intense mechanical
stress, flames, etc.
Nexans also develops manufacturing processes that are cleaner and consume less energy and raw
materials, and refines its process controls so as to reduce scraps, satisfy customers, and build customer
loyalty. In addition, to help identify the best production techniques available, Nexans’ product
developers use EIME (Environmental Information & Management Explorer) software to compare the
environmental characteristics of various options, including suppliers in the process.

**Strict environmental management**
Nexans’ environmental and safety policy is outlined in a Risk Management Charter, which calls for a
thorough analysis of the risks related to the Group’s products and manufacturing processes, a
continuous improvement program incorporating production plant audits, and employee training on
good environmental practices. The environmental policy is steered by the Corporate Industrial
Management team, which reports directly to the Strategic Operations Department. A Group
Environmental Manual describes all the procedures, performance targets, emergency plans, and tools
available at each site. The guidelines and objectives apply to everyone. In addition, an Environment
intranet is available which compiles all the necessary information about the Group’s environmental
organization and procedures, and enables sites to share best practices organized by subject matter.

**In-depth audits and a demanding label**
The Group’s sites are monitored through an annual Environmental Survey based on ISO 14001
standards and regularly updated, and through a series of environmental audits conducted by a
company that specializes in this area.
The survey reviews all the key elements of responsible environmental behavior classified under 12
themes and allows Nexans to list the investments made to improve environmental performance. Each
site is ranked between 1 (excellent) and 4 (immediate corrective action required) on every element,
according to a scoring grid updated annually and validated by the Group’s Environment Committee

(17) Note: Key environmental data are given on pages 89 to 94 of this Prospectus.


-----

comprised of representatives from the Corporate Industrial, Strategic Operations, Purchasing, Legal,
Risk Management, and Human Resources and Communications departments.
Almost all of Nexans’ sites participated in this continuous improvement program in 2006.
Nexans also has EHP, _Environnement Hautement Protégé_ (Highly Protected Environment) label
program to address the specific environmental risks posed by the Group’s operations. During 2006, 27
sites were audited and 15 were awarded the EHP label: 7 in France, 2 in Switzerland, 2 in Canada, and
1 each in Germany, Spain, Brazil, and China. By the end of the year, 45 Nexans sites had the EHP
label and 33 were ISO 14001 certified.

**Investments in 2006**
Soil protection, water management, and hazardous fluids management are all priorities for Nexans.
The Group is particularly focused on phasing out single-wall underground storage tanks. Liquid
retention is another area undergoing constant improvement, with secured premises and dedicated
areas, cabinets, and holding vats. Nexans’ efforts also extended to included wastewater treatment
systems and fire extinction water retention.
Many sites made investments in these various areas in 2006. These included: a system to stop emitting
waste directly into surface water at the Breitenbach, Switzerland, plant (219,000 euros); a rainwater
recovery program at the Hanover, Germany, plant (295,000 euros); and a new wastewater flow path at
the Lens, France, plant (250,000 euros).
Many sites also invested in energy-saving initiatives such as replacing air compressors with more
modern, cost-effective equipment, installing new lighting and heating systems, and replacing boilers
that consumed a great deal of energy. The Lens, France, plant invested 10 million euros in a
continuous caster fed by copper pellets made from cable waste from Nexans’ RIPS subsidiary. Finally,
the Group has committed to disposing of its pyralene (PCB) transformers by 2010, most of which are
located in France; 4 were replaced in 2006.

**A major player in recycling**
Nexans’ RIPS subsidiary is devoted entirely to recovering and recycling cable manufacturing waste
and cables at their end-of-life. This site is located in the port area of Calais, France, and is ISO 9001
version 2000 and ISO 14001 certified. RIPS collects cable waste from all of Nexans’ European plants
and offers complete recycling solutions to customers owning discarded cables. In 2006, France
Telecom signed a three-year contract with RIPS to manage the collection and recycling of its cable
waste.
After the waste has been processed, aluminum and copper scraps are melted, and plastics are recycled
into exterior coatings, curbs, and traffic cones. Grinding scraps are recycled into packaging products.
RIPS processed 25,000 tons of cable waste in 2006, 20,600 tons of which were manufacturing waste
and 4,400 tons were discarded cables.

**MANAGEMENT REPORT PRESENTED**
**BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO THE**
**ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING**

**(Year ended December 31, 2006)**

The purpose of this report is to present an overview of the operations and results of the Nexans Group
and its parent Company for the year ended December 31, 2006. It is based on the parent Company’s
financial statements and consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Nexans’ shares are traded on the Eurolist (compartment A) of Euronext Paris S.A. and are included in
the SBF 120 index. The Company’s estimated ownership structure, broken down by shareholder
category, was as follows at December 31, 2006: (i) institutional investors – France, 32.1%; the UK and
Ireland, 24.5%; other European countries, 11.2%; USA, 21.8%; Rest of the World, 1.9%; (ii) private
investors and employees, 8.3%; and (iii) unidentified shareholders, 0.2%.

**1. Operations during 2006**

**1.1. Significant events of the year**

**1.1.1. Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories**

Following the adoption of IFRSs on January 1, 2004, inventories of non-ferrous metals, referred to as
“core exposure”, were classified as property, plant, and equipment. These assets correspond to the
quantities of non-ferrous metals needed for regular plant operations. Their volume is maintained and is
continually replenished; therefore they are not hedged by futures contracts. As they were classified as
property, plant, and equipment, these inventories were recorded at historical cost at January 1, 2004.
They were not depreciated as their residual value is greater than their carrying amount and they have
indefinite useful lives.

However, inventories of non-ferrous metals other than those used as core exposure were recognized as
inventories and measured at purchase cost as calculated by the weighted average cost method.

The accounting methods applied by the Group in relation to these inventories in 2004 and 2005 is
discussed on page 10 of the document entitled “Transition to IFRS Standards” included in Nexans’
2004 Annual Report.

In the 2006 consolidated financial statements, the above-mentioned materials previously classified as
property, plant, and equipment have been reclassified as inventories, and are now therefore measured
using the average weighted cost method. The financial statements for 2004 and 2005 have been
restated using this new classification in order to facilitate year-on-year comparisons.

At the time of its transition to IFRS, Nexans classified core exposure as property, plant, and equipment
with a view to neutralizing the effect of metal price fluctuations on the income statement, in line with
the Group’s risk management policy for metals. Nexans used the LIFO method before adopting IFRS.
In view of recent market conditions, Nexans – along with the other European groups faced with the
same situation – reviewed the IFRSs applicable concerning the recognition and measurement of this
type of inventory. This review led to the Group’s decision described above to measure all non-ferrous
metals inventories using the weighted average cost method. Given the surge in non-ferrous metal
prices over the past three years, this new method will better reflect the value of the inventories
presented in the Group’s balance sheet.


-----

The rise in non-ferrous metal prices and the subsequent revaluation of core exposure using the
weighted average cost method served to increase the working capital included in the company’s nonfinancial assets that must be tested for impairment whenever there is evidence of a loss in value. This
in turn led to higher impairment losses recognized for certain cash-generating units at December 31,
2005.

### 1.1.2. Acquisitions of significant equity interest in other companies

� On December 1, 2006, Nexans acquired the entire capital of the Australian group Olex for
an enterprise value of 312 million euros. This acquisition, Nexans’ largest to date, strengthens the
Group’s core business and doubles its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Olex employs 910 people
and generated 330 million euros in sales in 2006 at current metal prices, or 240 million euros at
constant metal prices. Olex has three production sites, located at Tottenham and Lilydale in Australia,
and New Plymouth in New Zealand. It also has a dozen sales offices spanning Australia, New
Zealand, Singapore, and China. The company makes cables for power transmission and distribution
(33% of its sales), specialty products, primarily for the mining industry (24%), and cables for the
building, energy and telecommunications markets (43%). As the impact of this acquisition on Nexans’
consolidated sales, operating margin, and net income was not material for 2006, Olex has only been
consolidated by the Group since December 31 of that year.
� In the second half of 2006, Nexans and Viscas, a joint venture between Furukawa Electric
Co., Ltd. and Fujikura Ltd., created the Nippon High Voltage Cable Corp. (NVC) based in Japan.
Nexans owns 66% of the new company with Viscas (JV Furukowa Electric Co., Ltd et Fujikura Ltd)
owning the remaining 34%. As part of this operation, Viscas contributed its existing manufacturing
plant in Tokyo Bay to the new entity. NVC will manufacture high-voltage submarine power cables
exclusively for its two shareholders, and will have no other operations. NVC was consolidated into the
Nexans Group on December 31, 2006.
� In January 2006, Nexans acquired a 100% stake in Confecta, a European maker of cable
harnesses for the railway and other industrial sectors. The company was previously owned by four
private shareholders. Confecta employs approximately 180 people and generates annual consolidated
sales of some 20 million euros. The group comprises six companies – Confecta Holding, Confecta AG,
Confecta Verbindungstechnik and Confecta Fiberoptic in Switzerland, Confecta GmbH in Germany
and Confecta SAS in France.
� Also during the year, Nexans created the Vietnam-based Nexans Lioa in which it holds a
60% stake. The remaining 40% is held by two Vietnamese companies which contributed their cable
manufacturing businesses for energy networks, equipment, and industry. Nexans Lioa was
consolidated into the Nexans Group in May 2006, and is currently in the operational start-up phase.
� Nexans increased its interest in its Korean subsidiaries Nexans Korea and Kukdong
Electrical Wire to 99.5% and 97.9%, respectively, for a total price of 42 million euros.
� Nexans bought out certain minority shareholders in Morocco, increasing its stake from
74.6% to 83.6%, and raised its interest in China-based Nanning Huasun Cable to 100%.

**1.2. Consolidated results of the Nexans Group**

**1.2.1. Overview**

Net sales for 2006 totaled 7,489 million euros, compared with 5,449 million euros in 2005. At constant
non-ferrous metal prices, the figure came to 4,442 million euros compared to 4,263 million euros in
2005. At constant non-ferrous metal prices and constant 2006 exchange rates, sales for 2006 rose by
3.3%, and based on constant exchange rates and a comparable scope of consolidation (like-for-like)
the increase came to 8.2%.

Operating margin amounted to 259.8 million euros, or 5.8% of sales at constant metal prices (3.5% at
current metal prices), and net income attributable to the Group stood at 241 million euros. These
figures represent a significant improvement on 2005 when operating margin was 185.9 million euros,
or 4.4% of sales, and attributable net income totaled 108 million euros. In a global economic climate


-----

marked by sustained demand and considerable increases in raw material prices, Nexans’ sustained
growth – particularly in high value-added market segments – coupled with careful cost controls helped
the Group to boost overall profitability levels.

After taking into account the 149 million euros gain on the sale of the distribution business in
Switzerland, consolidated income before taxes rose from 189 million euros in 2005 to 297 million
euros in 2006.

After the 48 million euros tax charge and a 4 million euros net loss contributed by discontinued
operations, attributable net income rose from 108 million euros in 2005 to 241 million euros in 2006.

Minority interests fell from 9 million euros to 3 million euros, primarily as a result of the minority
buyouts in Nexans Korea and Kukdong Electric Wire Co. Ltd.

**1.2.2. Analysis of the Group’s consolidated results[(18)]**
_(sales figures by origin at constant non-ferrous metal prices)_

**1.2.2.1. By business**

ENERGY

Energy business sales amounted to 2,983 million euros (up 4.1% on 2005, and 11.3% on a like-for-like
basis).

In the land-based infrastructure sector, growth was particularly buoyant (7.1% on a like-for-like basis).
Demand in Europe was fuelled by investment spending in network maintenance, which saturated the
medium-voltage cable production facility. High-voltage terrestrial cables saw new international
contract wins despite stiff competition, most notably in rapidly developing countries and in the Middle
East. In North America, demand for low-voltage power distribution and overhead cables picked up as
the effects of the 2005 Energy Bill began to be felt, while in Brazil, Nexans benefited from the
government’s “Luz Para Todos” initiative to expand the country’s electricity network. In Lebanon,
despite the tense political situation, business held firm at 2005 levels and the Group’s production site
was spared from the negative impacts of the conflict. Finally, Turkey had an excellent year, both in
terms of financial performance as well as progress in adapting to the manufacturing equipment
conversion program started in 2006.

In high-voltage submarine and umbilical cables, Nexans won major new contracts in 2006. These
included a direct electrical heating system for underwater pipes for a Statoil oil field, a 296 km highvoltage submarine cable to supply electricity to the Valhall offshore oil field (in the Norwegian sector
of the North Sea), a 60 km three-core AC cable for the Long Island Replacement Cable project in the
US (the biggest 138 kV cable ever built), and an 80 km electricity supply cable for Delma Island in
Abu Dhabi. Given the challenging environmental conditions for some of these contracts, the Group
had to allocate more resources than originally planned. To serve this rapidly-growing market, Nexans
made sizeable investments to expand capacity at its Halden manufacturing plant in Norway, and
integrated a new production unit in Japan as part of a joint venture with Viscas. This new unit in Japan
will increase the company’s high-voltage submarine cable production capacity by 33%. In addition,
Nexans bought the C/S Skagerrak, one of the world’s most powerful cable-laying vessels, thus
bolstering its submarine cable resources.

In low-voltage cables for the building sector, like-for-like sales jumped 12.6%. Overall, the dynamic
market allowed the Group to offset the surge in copper prices during the year and strong demand lifted
earnings considerably. In Europe, demand from the residential building sector continued to be robust

-----

(e.g., in Greece, Spain, the Netherlands, and Turkey), while in North America, a healthy business
climate generated solid earnings.

In industrial cables, like-for-like sales rose by a robust 9.4%. The shipbuilding and offshore platform
markets proved to be particularly contributive in 2006, thanks to the Group’s leadership position
backed by the Kukdong plant in Korea and the Nexans plant in Shanghai. Harnesses benefited from
successful high-end products for the German car market, as well as growing demand for truck
harnesses in the US. Nexans further strengthened its presence in the industrial harnesses market
(railways) with the Confecta acquisition. In addition, the ramp-up of automotive cable production lines
in Morocco and Romania is well on track, and contributing to the Group’s expansion.

Nexans refocus on its priority segments, helped boost sales of cables for material handling,
petrochemical, and nuclear applications. The Group is currently implementing a conversion program
for its copper instrumentation cable production lines in Brazil, Turkey, and Lebanon, in order to
increase manufacturing capacity.

Operating margin for the Energy division was 233 million euros in 2006 compared to 171 million in
2005. This sharp rise is largely the result of the recovery reported by the industrial cables business and
particularly good performance in low-voltage cables for the building sector.

TELECOM

Sales in the Telecom business advanced 2.9% to 648 million euros (1.7% on a like-for-like basis). In a
low growth market, Nexans’ business was fueled by investments in railway infrastructure and demand
for high-speed LAN cables.

Like-for-like sales for the public network cables business contracted 2.5% in 2006, hurt by
plummeting demand for ADSL cables in Europe and limited telephone network investment in
developing countries. In light of these factors, some of Nexans’ production units converted their
equipment to industrial cable manufacturing. However, demand for fiber cables remained robust in
Northern Europe due to a proliferation of local loop networks.

In the private networks sector, sales edged up 1.7% on a like-for-like basis. The lack of major building
cable projects in Europe put pressure on sales volumes. Nevertheless, profitability improved due to
higher margins from the copper telecom businesses in Norway and Spain, as well as stronger sales of
category 6 and 7 cables and cabling systems. Because market perspectives did not allow a clear
visibility on the timing for a recovery in European volumes, it has been decided to close the Group’s
loss-making Abbey Wood site in the UK and transfer the equipment to the Tuzla plant in Turkey.

Profitability in the US improved considerably thanks to the Group’s strategy of focusing on higher-end
products, although sales of copper LAN cables did fall slightly. The Elm City plant is continuing to
implement its manufacturing improvement plan, and has installed the latest aerospace cable
production technology. Sales advanced 12% in 2006, on the back of 25% growth in the previous year.

In industrial electronic cables, a stagnant ADSL market and fierce competition from Asia led Nexans
to close its Opglabbeek site and transfer some of the equipment to sites in Fumay, France, and
Kanghua, China. The main growth drivers in this business were cables for the aerospace industry
(despite the difficulties encountered by the Airbus A380 program) and geophysics applications.

Operating margin almost doubled in 2006 to 48 million euros, from 25 million euros in 2005, thanks
to a better product mix across the Group and continued cost-cutting efforts.


-----

ELECTRICAL WIRES

Sales in the Electrical Wires business in 2006 were 801 million euros, up 5.7% on 2005 or 3.1% on a
like-for-like basis.

In the wirerod segment, there was a modest increase in demand from non-Group customers. In North
America, buoyant demand in the first half of the year gave way to a sharp slowdown in the second.
Sales were also impacted by the Group’s decision to gradually reduce its exposure to the copper
market. Furthermore, the plunge in copper prices at the end of the year prompted Nexans’ customers to
adopt a wait-and-see approach.

In the bare wire segment, sales contracted 6%, although performance was mixed across different
countries. Germany saw robust demand for specialty products for the automotive industry, while sales
tumbled in France where Nexans sells more commodity products.

In winding wires, where the products that Nexans makes are mainly for power transformers in Canada
and China, sales benefited from heavy investment spending in energy networks.

As a result of these difficult market conditions the operating margin of the Electrical Wires division
dropped to a negative 4 million euros compared to a positive 6 million euros in 2005. Profitability was
further impacted by a non-recurring provision recorded in relation to a legal dispute.

UNALLOCATED OPERATIONS

Certain of Nexans’ operations incur expenses which are labeled “unallocated” because they cannot be
attributed directly to one of the Group’s defined businesses or regions. These amounts are not material
on a consolidated level, representing a negative operating margin impact of 18 million euros in 2006,
compared with a negative 16 million euros in 2005.

**1.2.2.2. By geographical area**

EUROPE

Europe recorded sales of 3,021 million euros in 2006, up 1.1% on 2005, or 8.5% on a like-for-like
basis. Most of Nexans’ businesses in the region continued to recover, propelled by a favorable
economic climate, enhanced product mix and sales efforts, manufacturing facility rationalization, and
cost-cutting efforts. 68% of Nexans’ sales were made in Europe, and the region received over 60% of
the Group’s capital expenditure and accounted for the majority of its restructuring costs.

� Sales in the European Energy business rose 1.3% in 2006, or 12.1% on a like-for-like basis. The
operating margin climbed from 4.7% to 5.9%. Energy continues to be Nexans’ largest business in
Europe, generating 73% of its sales and 87% of its operating margin.

Sales from industrial cable harnesses jumped 18.6% in 2006, or 6.4% based on a comparable scope of
consolidation, which in turn boosted the operating margin to 7.8%. This outstanding performance can
be attributed to continued strong sales of high value-added products – which Nexans has identified as
“priority segments” in its Strategic Plan – coupled with the impact of the Confecta acquisition in the
industrial harnesses market.

Sales volumes of low-voltage cables for the building sector also rose sharply in 2006, especially in
housing markets across Europe. This increase, combined with sustained cost-cutting efforts, helped
push operating margins upwards.


-----

Demand for low- and medium-voltage cables and accessories for power networks grew in Northern
Europe and Italy. In addition, several projects such as the Lötschberg tunnel in Switzerland were
finalized in 2006.

High-voltage cables and accessories also saw an upswing in sales thanks to sizable oil sector
investments in both land and submarine cables. In order to meet this booming demand, Nexans
increased production capacity at its Halden plant in Norway, and entered into agreement with Viscas to
create a new company in Japan. However, profits from this business were pressured by technically
complex contracts for umbilical cables.

� Sales in the European Telecom business edged up 2.2% in 2006, but held steady on a like-for-like
basis. However, the operating margin grew from 2.6% of sales in 2005 to 4.7% as Nexans refocused
its operations.

Sales of telecom network cables stabilized in 2006, although they slipped 1.2% on a like-for-like basis.
Results were mixed in different segments. Sales of submarine optical fiber cables in Norway surged
due to high business levels in the hydrocarbon sector, while a scarcity of major projects in Central
Europe and a slowdown in ADSL deployment hurt sales of copper cables and accessories to telecom
operators. Nexans continued to rationalize its manufacturing facilities in 2006, closing its Opglabbeek
plant in Belgium and transferring part of its production to sites in France and Spain.

Sales from LAN cables rose in 2006 due to the full-year impact of the UK business acquired in 2005,
as well as sustained growth in sales of category 6 and 7 cables related to stepped-up cabling systems
development.

Finally, strong momentum in the aerospace and oil segments drove a 5.4% rise in sales of electronic
cables.

� Sales in the European Electrical Wires business held firm at 2005 levels, although profitability
improved thanks to a more targeted marketing approach and a focus on specialty products.

NORTH AMERICA

In North America, Nexans recorded sales totaling 813 million, an increase of 7.9% compared with
2005 (4.7% like-for-like).

Operating margin was up over 50% in absolute terms following an excellent 2005, as a result of
favorable prices and strong positioning in strategic markets.

� In power cables, including land infrastructure and buildings, sales climbed 4.2% at constant
exchange rates. Cables for industry and buildings had a solid year with higher operating margins,
despite a sluggish second half. The infrastructure market proved to be highly profitable due to network
maintenance and expansion requirements in North America; this was particularly true for mediumvoltage cables where prices rebounded.

� In the telecom sector, like-for-like sales inched up 0.9%. Nexans decided to focus on high-end
applications for LAN cables and reduce its exposure to the very competitive low-end cable market.
Although overall sales volumes declined in 2006, volumes of high added-value cables (category 6 and
above) were up significantly. This strategy boosted profitability substantially, helped by hedges on the
business’ raw materials. 2006 also saw a turnaround in the optical fiber cables business in spite of a
stagnant market. In the shipbuilding and aerospace segments, Nexans continued to build sales and
resist strong competition.

� Wirerods experienced a turbulent year. Sales started 2006 well only to fall off in the second half.
This reflected both a retreat in the overall market (i.e., a slowdown in the US economy, particularly in


-----

the construction sector) and Nexans’ desire to scale back volumes in this resource-consuming business
in light of the surge in copper prices.

� Winding wires benefited from a buoyant energy distribution market as transformers in North
America are going through a replacement cycle. Nexans’ winding wire production plant needs
however to continue to improve its manufacturing performance.

ASIA-PACIFIC

In the Asia-Pacific region, sales rose from 247 million euros in 2005 to 277 million euros in 2006, up
12% on a published basis, or 6.3% like-for-like.

Operating margin grew from 4.6% in 2005 to 6.8% in 2006, thanks to Nexans’ strategy of maintaining
prices and quality while being more selective in its sales approach.

In Korea, like-for-like sales dipped 2.1%, although the business’ profitability improved. Sales volumes
of cables for shipbuilding remained robust, reflecting a healthy market that prompted Nexans to
increase its capacity at the end of the year. Cables for the automotive industry benefited from a
rapidly-growing domestic market. However, sales of telecom cables, power cables for the building
sector, and medium-voltage cables proved disappointing as high copper prices caused operators to
scale back orders.

Sales in China bounded 33% at constant exchange rates. All of Nexans’ cable manufacturing
businesses gained ground, including the special cables business which started operations in 2005.
Most of the special cables produced in 2006 were sold to the shipbuilding industry, although sales are
starting to expand into other sectors such as railways.

Vietnam reported a 23% increase in like-for-like sales. The best performers during the year were
power cables, particularly bare overhead cables, whose sales helped to fuel increased export activity.
In addition, Nexans and Lioa created a joint venture based in Hanoi to manufacture low- and mediumvoltage power cables. This new company, which began operations in the second half of 2006, will
increase Nexans’ production capacity for the Vietnamese market.

REST OF THE WORLD

The Rest of the World area reported strong sales growth: 330 million euros in 2006 compared with
275 million euros in 2005, representing an increase of 20% (16.9% on a like-for-like basis).

In Turkey like-for-like sales soared 47.5%. The Denizli plant reaped the benefits of a strong market for
low- and medium-voltage power cables, both in its domestic market and in the UK and Ireland, which
the plant now serves. Meanwhile, the Tuzla plant, which had previously made copper telecom cables,
was converted to more promising products in terms of market development such as instrumentation
cables for the oil segment. The plant also began manufacturing LAN cables for Nexans’ European
customers at the end of 2006.

In Morocco, sales jumped 22.9% at constant exchange rates, propelled by Nexans’ solid position in a
dynamic energy market. Sales of cables for the building sector and electrical equipment were
especially strong following the Moroccan government’s initiatives to extend electricity lines into rural
areas. Nexans Morocco has developed special electrical equipment tailored to this market. The
Mohammedia plant was restructured in 2006 in order to help drive sales of cables for the automotive
industry; a market that is continuing to perform well.

Profitability in Brazil improved despite stable sales volumes, thanks to progress in the LAN business.


-----

Lebanon had an outstanding year, in spite of the turbulent political climate in the country since mid2006. Like-for-like sales rose 6.2% fueled by high export levels.

Egypt suffered from falling demand for copper telecom cables. However, because demand for
medium- and high-voltage power cables in Egypt is still increasing, Nexans invested heavily in 2006
with a view to improving the performance of its manufacturing equipment serving this market.

**2. Other items of 2006 consolidated results**

**2.1. Core exposure effect**

The change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories described in Section 1.1.1
above, had an impact of 107 million euros. This amount – which corresponds to the year-on-year
change in the value of the Group’s core exposure as calculated by the weighted average cost method –
is not included in operating margin. Changes in the value of inventories that are included in operating
margin are measured based on replacement cost, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies.

**2.2. Net asset impairment and negative goodwill**

Net asset impairment and negative goodwill totaled 99 million euros in 2006, up considerably from
2005. This increase primarily reflects the impact of the jump in non-ferrous metal prices and
subsequent revaluation of core exposure using the weighted average cost method, which served to
increase the working capital included in the Group’s non-financial assets that must be tested for
impairment whenever there is evidence of a loss in value. This change therefore led to higher
impairment losses for certain cash-generating units in 2006 relative to the previous year.

**2.3. Restructuring costs**

Restructuring costs came to 48 million euros compared with 24 million euros in 2005. These expenses
are related primarily to the closure of three plants: one in Opglabbeek, Belgium, which employed
123 people; one in Abbey Wood, UK, which employed 93 people; and one in Marseille, France
(TLM) which employed 34 people. Other, less extensive capacity reductions took place in Italy,
France, Germany, and Spain.

All these plans were accompanied by labor force measures negotiated with employee representatives,
intended to ease the impact on the employees involved.

**2.4. Change in fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives**

Nexans uses futures contracts negotiated primarily on the London Metal Exchange (LME) to reduce
its exposure to non-ferrous metal price fluctuations (copper and aluminum). However, due to the sharp
volatility in non-ferrous metal prices over the past several months, the Group invested in measures that
enabled in a large portion of these financial instruments to be classified as cash flow hedges as defined
in IAS 39. As from November 1, 2006, when these instruments are used to hedge future transactions
that are highly probable but not yet invoiced (e.g., copper cathode purchases), and they meet the
requirements set forth in IAS 39 for cash flow hedge accounting, they are treated similarly to foreign
currency hedges, as follows: the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is
determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in equity, and the ineffective portion is
recognized in the line item “Change in fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives.” Gains or losses
previously recognized in equity are taken to the income statement in the period during which the
hedged item (e.g., copper cathode purchases) affects income.

In 2006, the income statement impact of changes in the fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives
represented a loss of 7 million euros, compared with a gain of 33 million euros in 2005.


-----

**2.5. Gains or losses on asset disposals**

This item primarily concerns the 149 million euros gain generated in early 2006 on the sale of the
Group’s distribution business in Switzerland (Electro-Matériel SA) to Rexel.

**2.6. Financial income and expenses**

The Group recorded a net financial expense of 69 million euros in 2006, compared with 36 million
euros in 2005. This increase primarily reflects the following:
- a 7.3 million euros increase in interest expense related to higher average debt levels and interest
rates,
- a 6.4 million euros cash payment made to holders of Nexans 2004-2009 OCEANE convertible
bonds upon conversion,
- an 11.6 million euros increase in the charge for the ineffective portion of the Group’s foreign
currency hedges.

**2.7. Net loss from discontinued operations**
In 2006 this item was essentially made up of impairment losses on assets of the winding wires
businesses discontinued in 2005.

**2.8. Income taxes**

In view of the improved performance of several subsidiaries and the recognition of a deferred tax asset
for subsidiaries which are still loss making (but whose outlook is positive), and the tax exemption
applicable to part of the gain on the sale of the Electro-Matériel business in Switzerland, the Group’s
corporate income tax charge came to 48 million euros in 2006 compared with 26 million euros one
year earlier.

**2.9. Principal cash flows for the period**

Cash flow from operations amounted to 226 million euros in 2006, compared with 196 million euros
in 2005. This amount was primarily used to partially finance a 171 million euros investment program
and a 235 million euros increase in working capital in line with business growth and price increases
for copper and other commodities. The net impact of the Group’s company acquisitions and sales in
2006 was a cash outflow of 177 million euros.

**2.10. Balance sheet**

At December 31, 2006 the balance sheet showed:

- A 259 million euros increase in net debt to 633 million euros. The gearing ratio (net debt/total
equity) represented 39.8%.

- Working capital requirements totaling 1,465 million euros, representing 18.1% of sales at
current copper prices (excluding Olex) for full-year 2006, up 0.1 points on the same ratio calculated
based on equivalent items at December 31, 2005. This includes a 422 million euros impact from the
change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories (Core exposure effect).

- Provisions for contingencies and charges – including for pensions and other post-employment
benefit obligations – in an amount of 469 million euros, on a par with the 450 million euros recorded
one year earlier.

- A 37 million euros increase in non-current assets from 1,118 million euros to 1,155 million
euros. This rise reflected the combined impact of capital expenditure outstripping the depreciation
expense for the period and the reclassification of 35 million euros worth of assets as held for sale
following the Group’s decision to divest its Simcoe plant and Nexans Tianjin. The main capital
expenditure incurred during the period related to the high voltage and umbilical cables business in
Norway.


-----

**3. Progress made and difficulties encountered**

Progress was made in several essential areas during the year:
- Control of fixed and direct costs – This was a main focus for the Group in 2006 as its businesses
continued to expand. Efforts made to contain direct costs and improve the product mix improved the
variable cost margin considerably.
- Materials consumption – Nexans cut the amount of waste generated by its cable business by 3%,
and generated substantial savings through a new plastics procurement policy and a variety of materials
consumption reduction efforts, most notably in the area of composites.
- Manufacturing methods and best practices – 67 engineers and technicians from 30 production
sites attended training given by Nexans’ Industrial Management Department on problem-solving
methods and analytical applications. In addition, a workshop on the Group’s extrusion know-how was
added to the technical training catalogue in 2006, and was very popular among the production sites
using extrusion techniques.
- Workplace safety – Thanks to the successful roll-out of Nexans’ safety charter, the workplace
accident rate dropped by about 10% in 2006, and absenteeism fell by 0.6 percentage points.
All of the above initiatives helped improve production site operations and reduce the number of
customer complaints. Furthermore, fixed costs as a percentage of revenues declined during the year, as
a result of strict cost controls associated with restructuring and reorganization plans.
In terms of Nexans’ IT systems, several projects started four years ago were completed successfully in
2006, and goals were set for the next three years (2007 to 2009). As technology continues to advance
rapidly, Nexans has focused on upgrading its IT systems, particularly with regards to integrated
business management software. All the projects outlined in the Group’s strategic plan were completed.

A roll-out of SAP software and a specific application for car harness production began in 2006, and
met full satisfaction of users. SAP was also installed in order to manage continuous copper casting
operations in France and Germany, because their legacy applications could no longer be used
following the sale of the winding wire business. Several projects using Navision software were also
initiated to support the growth of the Group’s smaller units (e.g., in China, Lebanon, Romania, Ghana,
Japan, and Nexans logistics in the UK).

As part of the Group’s global focus on data security, several enhancements were made to its network
infrastructure, and annual vulnerability tests confirmed that permanent progress has been made.
Nexans also performed an internal audit using the Information Security Forum method, underscoring
this aspect of the Group’s risk management process. Cost cutting targets were reached one year ahead
of schedule, with IT expenses amounting to 1.2% of sales at constant copper prices. The Group has
reduced IT expenses by 23% over the past three years – corresponding to over 16 million euros of
savings – without cutting into needed infrastructure investments or application upgrades.

Going forward, Nexans plans to maintain IT expenses at their current level and to continue to monitor
spending. The Group has outlined several structuring projects, including a call for tenders to supply
and manage its WAN after its contract with AT&T ends in December 2007. Nexans’ WAN has recently
been upgraded to include new services and telephony. Nexans also amended its SAP contracts so that
the software can be used on a long-term basis under a license agreement, including software upgrades
from the supplier. At the same time, the Group intends to continue its process of replacing obsolete
applications, with the largest projects being in Canada and Switzerland. Several business support
functions have been enhanced, and a project to improve detailed planning at the Group’s plants is
already underway; the software has been purchased and configured internally for rapid deployment.
Finally, Nexans has reorganized its website and e-services site so that they can be used more easily by
its various partners (customers, suppliers, transporters, financial firms, etc.).

The main difficulties encountered in 2006 related to the impact of significantly higher prices for raw
materials, including the copper price which soared 76% year-on-year. As a result, Nexans’ sales team
was forced to pass on a large portion of these increases to its customers in order to protect the Group’s
margins on its full range of products. These elevated raw materials prices also meant considerably


-----

higher purchasing costs, which increased the business working capital requirements. Finally, the heavy
demand placed on Nexans’ plants strained the capacity of some manufacturing facilities and caused
occasional delivery delays.

**4. Research and development**

Nexans spent 54.6 million euros on R&D in 2006, representing slightly more than 1.2% of
consolidated sales, up from 53.6 million euros in 2005.

The Group’s R&D program is designed to maintain and improve its market position by developing
new products and improving the safety and quality of the production processes through increased
efficiency.

Nexans’ technical capabilities include some 450 staff with high-performance equipment. The Group’s
R&D teams work on long-term projects – such as understanding mechanisms and developing
innovative insulation and sheathing materials – which are essentially managed by its Research Center
(NRC), as well as short and medium-term projects, such as the creation and testing of new products
and systems or the use of computer modeling to accelerate time-to-market for products that perform
better or meet new specifications. Some 59 patents have been registered for the Group’s various areas
of activity, reflecting the quality of its technical teams.

In addition to the NRC, Nexans has eight technological competence centers, whose skills were
recognized in 2006 through the approval of several new products, including:
### - Fig-8 HTC/DuoTrack, a duplex copper/optical fiber cable used to automate data communications
on non-electric regional railways. The cable is laid alongside the track rather than strung across
towers. It is currently being used by Die Bahn, the German national railway (formerly Deutsche
Bahn).
### - A new-generation DSL cable selected for pilot studies by France Telecom. - A 10 Gbit/s cable that has been approved in the USA.  - A heating cable resistant to alkaline corrosion due to cement (approved for the Scandinavian
market).
- Automotive cables approved for use in temperatures between 125°C and 150°C.

**5. Trends**

In January 2007, Nexans presented to its Board of Directors a new Strategic Plan for 2007-2009 after
achieving the targets set in its previous plan one year ahead of schedule.

While the economic climate has not changed fundamentally from the time when the priorities of the
previous plan were set (i.e., moderate growth in Europe, more vibrant growth in North America, and
substantial potential in Asia and the Rest of the World region), the trends seen at the end of 2005 have
intensified. Demand for power cables remains strong, with competition increasingly fierce at the lower
end of the market, against a backdrop of extremely high raw materials prices. All these factors have
required Nexans to invest an increasing amount of human and financial resources.

As a result, the Group’s targets in the new Plan are to improve profitability, reduce exposure to shortterm business cycles, and focus on a smaller number of businesses and market segments that offer true
opportunities for synergies. The Plan was developed after an extensive review of all of Nexans’
operations, including an assessment of each business’ growth and profitability potential, business
cycle, and competitive positioning. Following this review, the Group divided its operations into three
different types of activities:
� cables and energy systems for infrastructure, industry, and buildings, which will be at the core of
Nexans’ strategy,
� telecom cables, a supplemental activity for which Nexans will use a more selective sales approach,


-----

� electrical wires, an upstream activity for which Nexans intends to gradually rationalize operations
so that it eventually serves only the Group's needs.

By the end of the 2007-2009 Strategic Plan, Nexans aims to be a global player in the infrastructure,
energy, and industrial sectors with a solid position in domestic building markets.

- The infrastructure market has a very positive outlook for the coming years. The trend in this
market is towards sustained, broad-based growth fuelled by new energy infrastructure being built in
emerging markets, as well as maintenance and upgrades in developed markets.

- The industry market is dependent on the global economy and stands to benefit from heavy
investments in petrochemicals and transport.

- The building market is buoyant in Europe, although it has experienced a temporary downturn
in North America. In rapidly-developing countries, it serves as a development basis for the Group’s
growth.

The Group intends to bolster its positions in these strategic sectors through:
- an enhanced product mix,
- expansion into new, profitable geographic markets,
- a stronger customer focus, achieved in part by setting up a new sales organization and a
technical support department serving the industrial sector, which will be divided into eight priority
market segments (shipbuilding, robotics, nuclear, oil and gas and petrochemicals, material handling,
electronics, automotive, and railway).

In the telecom business, Nexans plans to use a targeted business development strategy. In relation to
telecom infrastructures, this strategy will involve concentrating on promoting copper cables with
superior performance for use in XDSL applications, and optical fiber cable systems for use in FTTH
deployment. Nexans plans to leverage its small size and niche positioning in several of these markets.
Regarding LAN applications, the Group’s ability to exploit synergies is limited by the need to
implement a regional approach for selling these products. Furthermore, there is a growing risk that the
copper-based portion of this market will become commoditized.

At the same time, Nexans plans to gradually scale back its operations in electrical wires and wirerods
so that these businesses eventually serve only to supply the Group’s internal requirements.

This regional and business reorganization will require considerable resources, particularly in terms of
capital expenditure. The Group plans to invest an estimated amount of over 500 million euros between
2007 and 2009, with the three priority areas of energy infrastructure, industry, and buildings
accounting for over 80% of this total.

Nexans has set the following targets in its 2007-2009 Strategic Plan (calculated on a like-for-like
basis) which it intends to achieve through a focus on high value-added products, targeted efforts
towards the industrial sector, and continued restructuring initiatives (representing 30 million euros per
year):

- Consolidated sales of approximately 5,000 million euros (at constant metal prices), with
average annual organic growth of 6% (excluding the scaled-back operations in the electrical wires and
wirerod businesses);

- Operating margin of 7.5%;

- Pre-tax ROCE of around 13%;

- Neutral cash flow[(19)] in 2007, and positive cash flow in 2008 and 2009.

The forward-looking information given above is based on the following assumptions:
� Standard copper and aluminum prices of 1,500 euros per ton and 1,200 euros per ton, respectively.
� A copper price of 4,400 euros per ton over the entire 2007-2009 period for ROCE and cash flow
calculations.

(19) After changes in working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and dividends.


-----

� Constant exchange rates (euro against other currencies), using the rates in effect at year-end 2006.
� The same global economic climate as seen over the past few years, with a moderate slowdown in
growth in the US relative to Europe.
� An annual growth rate of approximately 3% for the global cable market between 2007 and 2009
(at constant copper prices).
� Continued growth in the infrastructure, transport, and petrochemicals markets.

**6. Principal risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed**

**6.1. Business risks**

In addition to the risks described in paragraph 6.2 to 6.4 below, the most significant risks identified as
applicable to Nexans’ operations and the Group as a whole are as follows:

- risks related to the seasonal nature of Nexans’ business;

- risks related to contractual liability;

- risks related to customer dependency;

- commodity and procurement risks;

- competitive risk;

- technology-related risk

- geopolitical risks in high-growth areas;

- environmental regulatory risk.

Each year, all these risks are reported on in detail and the “Risk Factors” chapter of the Reference
document prepared by Nexans is updated and filed with the French financial markets authority (AMF).

**6.2. Market risks**

Nexans’ main market risks relate to the following:
- interest rates;
- currency exchange rates;
- metal prices;
- counterparty credit default.

All these risks are discussed in detail in Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements, along with a
sensitivity analysis for 2006.

Nexans’ policies for managing interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, and non-ferrous metal price risk
are set and overseen by its Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department, and implemented by its
operating subsidiaries. Risk management for Nexans’ subsidiaries is managed by the Treasury and
Non-Ferrous Metals Department, whenever this practice is allowed by the legislation in the country
where the subsidiary is located. Countries that do not allow such centralized risk management include
Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, China, Korea, Vietnam, and Brazil. Subsidiaries in these countries
have therefore established their own relationships with banks, but have to follow the Group’s
procedures for selecting banks, managing interest rate and exchange rate risk, and managing hedges on
non-ferrous metals prices.

**6.3. Liquidity risks**

During the first half of 2006, the Group met its liquidity needs primarily through the issuance of
commercial paper on the French market and the proceeds of a convertible bond issued by the Group in
July 2004 in the amount of 135 million euros.


-----

However, in June 2006 three events changed the Group’s access to liquidity. First, the Group obtained
and exercised the right to call the aforementioned convertible bonds early, which resulted in a
117 million euros increase in equity and a reduction in its cash needs. Second, the Group carried out a
successful new convertible bond issue for 280 million euros in early July 2006, which improved its
financial flexibility. Third, Standard & Poor’s changed Nexans’ debt rating from BBB-/negative/A3 to
BB+/stable/B, which restricted the Group’s access to short-term commercial paper. Therefore in the
second half of 2006, Nexans covered its short-term cash needs through non-confirmed bank lines of
credit and by drawing down a portion of its confirmed medium-term credit facility in order to finance
the Olex acquisition at the end of November.

In order to manage its medium-term financing needs, Nexans obtained an extension of the expiry date
for its confirmed medium-term credit facility as well as an increase in the syndicated loan that had
previously been arranged with a group of banks. The amount available under this syndicated loan was
increased from 450 million euros to 580 million euros, with no change to the loan terms. The loan has
a duration of five years starting from October 2006, and is subject to the customary loan covenants
(e.g., a negative pledge, _pari passu, and cross default) and consolidated financial ratios (net_
debt/EBITDA < 2.95 and net debt/total equity < 1.15). Nexans was in full compliance with these ratios
at December 31, 2006 and at the date that this report was prepared. A breach of any of the loan
covenants would freeze any undrawn lines and accelerate the due date of any amounts outstanding,
either immediately or after a period of thirty days depending upon the nature of the covenant.

At December 31, 2006, the Group’s gross debt was 919 million euros. Out of this total, commercial
paper represented 43 million euros bank borrowings 506 million euros, sales of trade receivables
124 million euros, and the July 2006 convertible bond issue 246 million euros. The conversion option
related to these bonds is recognized in equity in the amount of 34 million euros. At the same date, the
Group had 287 million euros of cash and cash equivalents in the form of demand deposits, term
deposits, and short-term negotiable instruments.

The Group’s 120 million euros receivables assignment program for the sales of receivables related to
its main French operating subsidiaries (Nexans France, Société de Coulée Continue de Cuivre, and
Société Lensoise du Cuivre), negotiated in December 2003, was used fully during most of 2006. This
program was increased to 150 million euros upon renegotiation in December 2006, although the terms
remained the same. Certain Nexans subsidiaries outside France also sell receivables to cover some of
their working capital requirements whenever this type of financing is competitive.

**6.4. Customer credit risks**

Nexans’ credit risk is limited by the Group-wide protection represented by the diversification of its
businesses, its customers and its geographic base.

With respect to Nexans’ internal practices to reduce customer credit risk, for certain major export
markets the Group implements secured payment methods including down payments on orders,
progress payments, and irrevocable letters of credit confirmed by banks approved by the Treasury
Department. For its other markets Nexans has set up an insurance program relating to the risk of nonrecovery of customer receivables through a short-term credit insurance policy for sales in local and
export markets. This credit insurance policy – which has been taken out with the specialist
international insurer, Coface – covers companies representing approximately 80% of the Group’s
sales. By agreement with the insurer, certain customers representing a very low risk of default over the
short term are excluded from the credit insurance policy.

As part of its insurance coverage, Coface provides Nexans with access to a database concerning the
credit risk associated with each customer. This enables each unit to manage its risk by monitoring
customer outstandings against the insurance credit limits, and in the event of default, to limit the
impact on its cash position and income to any amount over the coverage limit and the policy
deductible (generally 10% of the insured amount). Outstandings in excess of the amounts covered by
the credit insurance policy are subject to periodic review by the Country Managers and their financial
controllers.

The level of provisions in 2006 was on a par with 2005, reflecting the fact that default risk on the
Group's trade receivables remained at a stable level.

**7. Significant events after the balance sheet date**

In late January 2007, Nexans signed two agreements to sell its winding wires businesses in Canada
and China to Superior Essex in the US for a total of 32 million euros. These agreements cover the
Simcoe site in Canada and Nexans’ 80% majority stake in Nexans Tianjin Magnet Wires and Cables in
China. These two businesses generated sales of 69 million euros in 2006 (at constant copper prices),
and at the year-end, employed 154 and 176 people, respectively. The sales are subject to approval by
the Chinese and Canadian regulators, as well as the approval by Tianjin’s other shareholder based in
China of the terms of the agreement. The sale is expected to be completed in the second quarter of
2007.

**8. Parent Company business overview**

Nexans serves as the Group’s holding company, manages its financing, and centralizes its cash
holdings. Nexans also plays a central role in collecting intra-Group royalty fees for R&D, which it
then allocates among its subsidiaries according to the R&D programs they carry out which benefit the
entire Group.

The parent Company’s sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 totaled 13,060,753 euros, and
came primarily from services billed to its subsidiaries. Net income for the year grew to
88,094,875 euros from 43,227,833 euros in 2005. This increase primarily reflects a rise in the
Company’s net financial income, which consisted mainly of a dividend paid to Nexans by its
subsidiary, Nexans Participations.

A net tax consolidation gain of 249,485 euros was recognized during the period.

The Company’s equity at end-2006 was 1,329,901,775 euros, compared with 1,150,780,410 euros at
December 31, 2005.

**9. Proposed appropriation of income**

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting will be invited to approve the appropriation of net income for the
year – totaling 88,094,875 euros – as follows:

- Retained earnings brought forward from prior years 84,400,957 euros

- 2006 net income 88,094,875 euros

- Legal reserve 175,763 euros

**Appropriation of income:**
(Based on the number of shares comprising the share capital at December 31, 2006)

- Dividend payment of 1.20 euros per share
representing a total dividend of 30,317,946 euros

- Retained earnings 142,002,123 euros
**Total** **172,320,069 euros**

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting will be invited to approve the payment of a dividend of 1.20 euros
per share, corresponding to a total dividend payout of 30,317,946 euros based on the number of shares
comprising the share capital at December 31, 2006.

However, this amount may be increased (implying a decrease in retained earnings) by a maximum
total amount of 660 275 euros taking into account the 660,275 maximum additional shares that may be
issued from January 1, 2007 through the date of the Annual Shareholder’s Meeting held to approve the
dividend payment in the event of the exercise of stock options.

The Annual Shareholders’ Meeting will be invited to approve the payment of such dividends as from
May 15, 2007.

In the event that Nexans still holds treasury stock at the time the dividend is paid, the amount
corresponding to the dividends not paid on these shares shall be appropriated to retained earnings.

All of the Company’s shares are of the same category and the total amount of dividends paid _i.e. a_
maximum sum of 30,978,221 euros, will qualify for the 40% relief provided for in article 158,
paragraphs 2 to 3 of the French General Tax Code (information disclosed in accordance with
article 243 bis of said Code).

The amount of dividends paid for the last three years, the related tax credits (2003) and the dividends
qualifying for the 50% relief (2004) and 40% relief (2005) were as follows:

**2003** **2004** **2005**
Dividend per share 0.20 euro 0.50 euro 1.00 euro
Tax credit 0.10 euro - Total income per share 0.30 euro 0.50 euro 1.00 euro
Dividends qualifying for the 50% relief (2004)
and 40% relief (2005):
 - Amount per share - 0.50 euro 1.00 euro
 - Number of shares qualifying - 21,136,773 21,661,745

**13. Information on Nexans’ share ownership and voting rights**

Based on information received pursuant to article L. 233-7 of the French Commercial Code, Dodge &
Cox (USA) was the only shareholder holding more than 5% of the Company’s share capital or voting
rights at December 31, 2006.

The following entities crossed legal disclosure thresholds in relation to the Company’s share capital
and voting rights during the year:

- Tweedy, Browne Company LLC, acting on behalf of a fund invested in Nexans shares,
reported on January 12, 2006 that it had reduced its interest in Nexans to below 5% of the Company’s
share capital on January 9, 2006. On January 20, 2006, Tweedy, Browne reported that it had
subsequently reduced its interest in Nexans to below 5% of the Company’s voting rights on January
13, 2006. On January 20, 2006, the said fund held 1,000,000 shares, or 4.28% of the share capital and
4.71% of voting rights.

- Morgan Stanley & Co International Ltd., owned by Morgan Stanley, reported on December
6, 2006 that it had increased its interest in Nexans to above 5% of the Company’s share capital and
voting rights on November 29, 2006, and subsequently reduced its interest to below these thresholds
on November 30, 2006. These Nexans share transactions were carried out as part of securities
borrowing and lending operations. Morgan Stanley reported that at November 30, 2006, it owned
1,002,374 shares, or 3.97% of the share capital and 3.94% of the voting rights.

Morgan Stanley & Co International Ltd., owned by Morgan Stanley, reported on January 9 and 10,
2007, respectively, that it had increased its interest to above 5% of Nexans’ share capital on January 8,
2007, and subsequently reduced its interest to below that threshold on January 9, 2006. Morgan
Stanley reported that at January 9, 2007, it owned 607,493 shares, or 2.41% of the share capital and
2.39% of the voting rights.

Employees owned 1.3% of the Company’s share capital at December 31, 2006, of which 88.5% was
held through employee mutual funds.

At December 31, 2006, the Company’s share capital was 25,264,955 euros divided into
25,264,955 shares with a par value of one (1) euro each. This amount includes the impact of
(i) 312,825 stock options exercised between January 1 and June 30, 2006; (ii) the cancellation of
2,221,199 treasury shares on March 29, 2006; (iii) the subscription of 65,797 new shares under an
employee share issue carried out on May 12, 2006; (iv) the issue of 3,534,160 new shares following


-----

the conversion of Nexans’ 3.125% OCEANE convertible bonds issued on July 15, 2004 and maturing
on January 1, 2010; and (v) 66,050 stock options exercised between July 1 and December 31, 2006.

At December 31, 2006, 279,240 shares carried double voting rights and the total number of voting
rights was 25,544,195. Pursuant to the Company’s bylaws, when voting at Shareholders' Meetings, no
shareholder, whether acting on his own behalf or as proxy for another shareholder, may exercise more
than 8% (or 16% for shares with double voting rights) of the voting rights attached to shares held by
shareholders present or represented at the meeting concerned.

**14. Share buyback program**

On March 29, 2006, the Board of Directors decided to cancel all 2,221,199 treasury shares held on that
date (approximately 9.4% of the Company’s share capital), and to reduce the Company’s share capital
accordingly.

The Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 15, 2006 authorized the Company to purchase or sell its
own shares pursuant to the terms and conditions fixed by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting. As the
Board did not use this authorization during the year, the Company did not hold any treasury shares at
December 31, 2006.

**15. Utilization of authorizations to increase the Company’s share capital**

At December 31, 2006, 1,462,775 employee stock options were outstanding, representing 5.79% of
the share capital. Each of these options entitles the holder to subscribe for one Nexans share.

A table summarizing the outstanding authorizations granted by the Shareholders’ Meeting to the Board
of Directors relating to capital increases is appended hereto. This table also lists how each capital
increase authorization was used during 2006.

**16. Management by Nexans of the social and environmental consequences of its operations**

**16.1. Environmental consequences of the Group’s operations**

**16.1.1. Nexans’ policy on environmental issues**

The environment and the safety of property and employees are of primary importance to Nexans. The
Group’s policy is outlined in the Risk Management Charter signed by the Chairman which is sent to
all sites worldwide and available on the Intranet. This charter covers improvement in performance
through auditing production sites as well as the assessment of risks relating to products and
manufacturing processes.

Nexans’ commitment to environmental protection is also reflected in its policy of training its
employees in environmental best practices.

Within the Group’s organization, environmental policy is the responsibility of the Industrial
Management Department, which reports directly to the Strategic Operations Department. The
Industrial Management Department supervises industrial strategy, investment budgets, the
management of major industrial projects and databases. The Department also manages crossorganizational projects, in particular product and process development, as well as the Group’s plant
and machinery. In each of these areas, it ensures that conservation and environmental protection
requirements are fully complied with.

The environmental rules and targets fixed by the Industrial Management Department apply to Group
operations worldwide, including international subsidiaries.


-----

The performance improvement program for production sites is monitored by the Environment
Committee, which comprises member of the Strategic Operations Department, the Industrial
Management and Technical Department, the Purchasing Department, the Legal Department, the Risk
Management Department and the Human Resources and Communications Department.

**Environmental management: measures taken to ensure applicable rules are respected**

Nexans has had an internal environmental management system in place for approximately ten years.
Its objective is to reduce pollution risks and control environmental costs (consumption of energy, raw
materials and hazardous substances, waste disposal and recycling).

Through this system and in accordance with ISO 14001, all the Group’s facilities are reviewed
annually, via a questionnaire covering 12 environmental issues, and rated based on a scoring grid. This
scoring grid changes each year in accordance with regulatory developments and those areas which the
Group wishes to improve. In 2006, the points reviewed included water recycling at the plants in order
to limit consumption, waste recycling and reuse, the identification of major environmental risks
(accompanied by specific crisis management plans), and the storage of hazardous liquids.

A Group environmental manual, approved by the Executive Committee, has been drawn up and sent to
all production sites, describing the procedures applied by Nexans Environmental Management system.
This manual serves as a reference document both for existing Environmental Management systems
and for those yet to be installed in the Group's plants. It describes the Group’s organization and the
role of Country Management in the implementation of the Group’s Environmental Policy.

Once the questionnaires have been analyzed, recommendations are sent to the sites in the form of
summaries and graphs. These enable any problems to be corrected through action plans that are
tailored to the sites so as to improve their environmental management.

**An objective external audit system**

In 2003, the Group launched a program of environmental audits which are performed by an
independent environmental audit firm. Since then, around 25 sites are audited each year, and if found
to be well-managed environmentally, they are awarded the EHP label, denoting compliance with the
highest environmental standards. Of the 27 sites audited in 2006, 15 were awarded this label: 7 in
France, 1 in Germany, 1 in Brazil, 1 in Spain, 2 in Canada, 1 in China, and 2 in Switzerland. By the
end of 2006, 45 Nexans sites had been awarded the EHP label. The sites that did not receive the EHP
label were given recommendations to implement in order to achieve the required level and took the
necessary corrective action. These actions are included in the plants’ 3-year plans.

The environmental audit program, which is the same for all the sites audited, is a means of checking
data relating to the consumption of materials (water, solvents, energy, packaging, etc.), discharges into
the air and water, ground protection, the condition of storage facilities, waste volumes and recycling
methods, as well as the impact of the Group’s activities in terms of noise. In addition to this highly
efficient system, certain of the Group’s plants are undergoing ISO 14001 certification. 33 Nexans sites
are already ISO 14001 certified.

**16.1.2. Environmental consequences of the Group’s operations and measures taken to limit their**
**impact**

The environmental impact of Nexans’ operations can be summarized as follows by sector:

**Copper and aluminum metallurgy**

The main resources used are energy (natural gas) and water, which is used for steam and cooling. Most
of the water consumed is recycled (95%).


-----

**Copper power and telecom cables**

Conductor manufacturing (drawing and stranding) consumes electrical power for annealing and oily
water for drawing lubrication. Wastewater is filtered, treated and recycled.

Extrusion cable manufacturing requires large quantities of water for cooling, which is recycled.
Consumption thus remains low.

Air emissions are low as they are treated by filter extractors specific to each facility.

Solvent consumption is very low considering the extremely large quantities of cables produced, and
pertains primarily to marking inks, which are handled in a specific way (by being stored in small
storage cabinets and the use of fume hoods to clean ink jets and wheels).

**Winding wires**

Due to the change in the Group’s scope of consolidation, the only winding wires production businesses
are now in Simcoe in Canada and Tianjin in China.

This business, which is no longer significant, consumes solvents and energy for drying varnishes.

**Waste recycling: a dedicated subsidiary**

The Nexans Group is committed to recycling its manufacturing waste. In 2006, RIPS, a Nexans
subsidiary based in Calais, recycled 20,600 tons of cable collected from most of the Group’s European
sites, as well as 4,400 tons of end-of-life cables collected directly from Nexans’ customers, making a
total of 25,000 tons of waste recycled. In addition, in order to build stronger ties with its customers
from outside the Nexans’ group, RIPS attended the Pollutec 2006 trade show in Lyon.

Thorough sorting of factory waste combined with the recycling of cable waste means that the majority
of the Group’s waste – including wood, paper, cardboard, ferrous materials, machine oil, batteries and
special waste – is reused in some way. Specific investments have also been made in this regard. For
example, 10 million euros were invested in the Lens plant in France for refining and wirerod
manufacturing from bare copper waste – an operation that is scheduled for start-up in 2007 – and
21,000 euros have been spent in Halden (Norway) and 55,000 euros in Mohammedia (Morocco) to
improve waste sorting.

_(*)_ _This table does not include data from the three Olex sites, which were consolidated by Nexans group on_
_December 31, 2006)._

These figures, which are an estimate based on the data collected, pertain to the Group’s scope of
consolidation at December 31, 2006.

In addition to the initiatives indicated above, the Group has implemented further specific measures,
especially in France, to eliminate transformers with PCBs before 2010 under a multi-year plan. The
replacement of oil-burning boilers with less polluting gas boilers or old heating units with units that
consume less energy; air and gaseous emission treatment through ventilation, extraction and specific
treatment systems; and the gradual phase-out of single-walled underground storage tanks are also
priorities.

There is also specific monitoring of the storage of liquids both in dedicated storage areas and
operational areas, for example oil storage methods.

**Environmental expenditure**

Environment-related investments are summarized in the following table:

2006 Soil and water Air protection Waste Noise Elimination of
(in thousand preservation and energy reduction reduction transformers
euros) savings with PCBs (in

France)
Amount 1,654 2,450 76 40 148
Total 4,368

In 2005, environment-related investment totaled approximately 2.9 million euros.

At December 31, 2006, the amount of provisions recorded for environmental risks was 6.446 million
euros. Additional expenses may be incurred for the clean-up of closed sites and sites likely to be sold,
but the Company expects these amounts to be less than the market value of the sites in question.

**Wastewater management and treatment**

The current degradation of groundwater tables and the global water shortage problem is a priority
issue in any sustainable development program. Nexans is addressing these problems by stepping up

monitoring of the storage of liquid pollutants in both specific storage areas and operational areas,
which has involved the following investments:

- in Breitenbach, Switzerland (eliminated waste emission directly into surface water –
219,000 euros);

- in Elouges, Belgium (built a waterproof storage area – 40,000 euros);

- in Hanover, Germany (instituted rainwater recovery systems – 295,000 euros);

- in Lens, France (reworked used water flows – 250,000 euros);

- in Vrigne, France (replaced a spray-painting booth – 182,000 euros).

The Group has also invested specifically in recycling water used for cooling. For example:

- in Autun, France (installed an air cooling tower – 40,000 euros);

- in Cortaillod, Switzerland (purchased a water cooling unit – 36,000 euros);

- in Fergus, Canada (installed a cooling tower – 146,000 euros);

- in Mehun, France (installed air cooling towers – 145,000 euros);

- in Sélestat, France (upgraded cooling towers – 18,000 euros);

- in Tuzla, Turkey (purchased a water cooling unit – 45,000 euros);

- in Vrigne aux Bois, France (purchased a water cooling unit – 49,000 euros);

- in Weyburn, Canada (improved cooling water flows – 40,000 euros).

**Energy management and savings**

The Group’s commitment to reducing energy consumption is illustrated by the following investments:

- Air compressors were replaced with modern, more energy-efficient systems at the following
sites:
- Buizingen, Belgium - 31,000 euros
- Cairo, Egypt - 11,000 euros
- Charleroi, Belgium - 80,000 euros
- Cortaillod, Switzerland - 145,000 euros
- Denizli, Turkey - 50,000 euros
- Erembodegem, Belgium - 14,000 euros
- Jincheon, Korea - 125,000 euros
- Lens, France - 75,000 euros
- Lyon, France - 40,000 euros
- Offida, Italy - 25,000 euros

- Lighting systems were overhauled and more energy-efficient lights were installed at the
following sites:
- Mönchengladbach, Germany - 90,000 euros
- New Holland, United States - 153,000 euros

- Heating systems were reworked and boilers were replaced by more energy-efficient equipment
at the following sites:
- Bohain, France - 390,000 euros
- Cortaillod, Switzerland - 33,000 euros
- Jincheon, Korea - 76,000 euros
- Mehun sur Yèvre, France - 290,000 euros
- Mönchengladbach, Germany - 70,000 euros
- Nuremberg, Germany - 70,000 euros

- The power factor was improved, and idle power reduced, at the following sites:
- Choung Won-Kun, Korea - 62,000 euros
- East Montreal, Canada - 98,000 euros


-----

**Environmentally-friendly products and solutions**

Nexans’ R&D program also serves the environment, with many of the Group’s ongoing R&D projects
involving the development of safer, less polluting and more energy-efficient products.
This is particularly true for research relating to the elimination of lead stabilizers in PVC sheaths;
superconductor cables that eliminate electromagnetic radiation and dielectric loss (e.g., the 60-km,
138-kV cable currently being developed for the Long Island Power Authority in the US).
There is also extensive research currently underway into fire-resistant and flame-retardant cables,
using non-halogen materials (for example, the Alsecure line of cables introduced in the UK in 2006).
At the same time, a number of the Group’s projects indirectly contribute to environmental protection,
such as the cables and equipment for wind turbines produced by the Group, cables to supply offshore
oil platforms on a “Power from Shore” basis (the BP/Valhall contract), and the use of EIME
(Environmental Information & Management Explorer) software that analyzes all the impacts from the
design of the cables through to the end of their useful life.

**16.2. Social aspects**

In 2006, Nexans set new goals for its human resources policy and identified priority action items to
help drive the Group's strategic plan. The Group continued to roll out its global performance indicator
policy, which is designed to be used at all its manufacturing sites and sales offices in 65 countries. This
method aims to give a clear vision of the Group's responsibilities towards its employees and the related
demographic and regional data.

**16.2.1. Group headcount, gender breakdown, personnel changes, fixed-term employment**
**contracts, overtime, and contracted labor**

**16.2.1.1. Group headcount**

In 2006, Nexans’ headcount grew by 8%, or 3,086 additional employees, with most recruitment
concentrated outside Europe as the Group focuses on expanding in rapidly-developing countries.

Rest of the

Europe North America Asia-Pacific World Total

Headcount at Dec. 31, 2006 14,372 1,961 2,459 2,358 21,150
Headcount at Dec. 31, 2005 14,274 1,835 1,270 2,205 19,584

The slight increase in headcount in Europe is the result of two offsetting trends:
### - capacity increases to serve the automotive harness market in Eastern Europe and the expanding power infrastructure in areas such as Norway,  - the implementation of restructuring plans that entailed the loss of 432 jobs and manufacturing capacity reductions in Nexans’ most competitive businesses, reflecting pressure from imports from low labor cost countries. 

The additional staff numbers in North America are primarily due to growth in specialty products and
truck harness manufacturing operations in Mexico.

The strong rise in headcount in the Asia-Pacific area can be attributed to Nexans’ acquisitions during
the year; i.e., Lioa in Vietnam, Nanning in China, and Olex in Australia.
Finally, in the Rest of the World area, most new employees were recruited in Turkey following the
relocation of Nexans’ European production sites.

The age pyramid shown above masks a stark contrast between:

- An aging population in Europe, where Nexans must face the double challenge of shifting
towards more high added-value products, which require an increasingly skilled workforce, and
preparing to replace many employees who will soon be going into retirement. In response, Nexans is
pro-actively recruiting engineers and managers, particularly by building ties with universities and
major engineering colleges. The Group has also created the Nexans University, in an effort to ensure
the transfer of knowledge and the relaying of best practices.

- And a young population in emerging countries, where Nexans’ key priorities are employee
training, strengthening its image as an attractive employer, and retaining key personnel at a time when
other foreign companies are also vying for top talent.

**Nexans’ new human resources policy**

In light of the employee demographics and job market in the countries where it operates, Nexans has
implemented a new human resources policy in order to better support the Group’s expansion. This

- A Career Management Committee, which will work with country managers to oversee a
specific career development program for executives, and identify and support high-potential future
managers and other key personnel.

- Projections of Nexans’ human resources needs, which will involve: (i) reviewing and
identifying the key management skills needed to lead the Group’s growth, expansion into new regions,
and achievement of operating targets; and (ii) preparing for changes in Nexans’ businesses and core
competencies. This approach began in 2006 in the purchasing and sales departments, and will continue
in 2007 in the experts, logistics, finance, and Industrial Management Departments.

- A new individual performance-based compensation policy and new conditions for employee
expatriation.

- A new training policy designed to address the Group’s new priorities, including the Nexans
University. In 2006, the Group surveyed the needs and expectations of Nexans management regarding
training and knowledge transfer. This feedback was combined to create the Nexans University, which
will start in 2007. The goal is to capitalize on the skills and know-how housed within all the Group’s
divisions and share them across the entire organization.

**Personnel changes in 2006**

Europe North America Asia-Pacific Rest of the World Total
Natural departures (1,635) (251) (140) (78) (2,104)
Layoffs (432) (1) 0 (8) (441)
New hires 2,342 378 138 224 3,086
Change in scope (177) 0 1,191 15 1,029

The main impacts of changes in the Group’s scope of consolidation come from the sale of the
distribution business in Switzerland in January 2006, the creation of Nexans Lioa in Vietnam, and the
integration of Nanning employees in China and Olex employees in Australia in December 2006.

In Northern Europe, Nexans is facing a tight job market at a time when its business is growing,
especially in Norway for the high-voltage submarine and umbilical cables businesses. To face this
challenge the Group has launched a major promotional initiative designed to boost recognition through
national advertising campaigns and associations with universities.

In the Asia-Pacific region, where Nexans has set ambitious growth targets, local sites have
implemented specific recruitment policies tailored to their particular job markets. For example, a new
compensation policy has been adopted in China in order to attract skilled workers and account for
wage inflation. The Group’s Chinese companies have also developed strong partnerships with local
universities.

**Fixed-term contracts**

The number of employees hired under fixed-term contracts stood at 2,063, or 9.8% of the total
headcount, at December 31, 2006.

**Overtime and contracted labor**

Overtime accounted for an average of 2.9% of the total hours worked by Nexans employees in 2006,
with marked differences by area: Europe, 1.1%; North America, 9.9%; Asia-Pacific, 8.1%; and Rest of
the World, 3.3%. Overtime was used mainly to meet rapid workload increases resulting from customer
demand.

-----

Contract employees working at Nexans sites made up an average of 6.6% of the total headcount in
full-time equivalents. They were used mostly in transport, manufacturing, maintenance, and industrial
cleaning.

The use of overtime and contracted labor described above is part of the Group’s deliberate human
resources strategy for being able to manage changes in workload resulting from the economic climate.

**16.2.1.2. Headcount reduction plans, job preservation efforts, and employee redeployment and**
**support**

Nexans continued to implement its restructuring plans throughout 2006, which primarily concerned
Europe. One of the Group’s key priorities during the year was to maintain sound relations between the
affected plants’ managers and their employee representatives. More specifically, the Group negotiated
conditions for employee dismissals and redeployment assistance, such as retraining units.

Three production sites were closed in Europe in 2006 as part of these restructuring plans (in
Marseilles, France, Abbey Wood, the UK, and Opglabbeek, Belgium), and a total of 487 employees
were affected, of which 441 left the Group. Internal mobility was used to transfer workers to other
Nexans sites as much as possible and thanks to the efforts of managers in France, the UK, and
Belgium, the internal and external redeployment rate exceeded 60%. Costs incurred in 2006 related to
restructurings totaled 48 million euros.

As a result of changing trends in Nexans’ businesses and a shift towards high-growth regions, the
Group plans to continue with its restructuring measures while maintaining its policy of open dialogue
with employee representatives. Nexans expects to incur restructuring-related costs of approximately
30 million euros per year going forward.

**16.2.2. Working hours, part-time employees, and absenteeism**

**Working hours**
Full-time employees worked a weighted average of 1,915 hours in 2006, with individual country
averages ranging between 1,600 hours and 2,450 hours.

**Part-time employees**
Part-time employees accounted for 3.4% of the total headcount (all employee categories included).
Part-time employees were used the most in Sweden (8.9%), Switzerland (6.7%), and Belgium (6.5%).
In France, the percentage of part-time employees was 2.3%.

**Absenteeism**
The average absenteeism rate across the Group was 4.0% in 2006, 0.6 percentage points lower than
2005. The specific measures implemented in order to reduce this rate at sites in several countries –
including France, the US, and Germany – have started to bear fruit e.g. in France, where the absentee
rate has fallen by 24% in 3 years.

**16.2.3. Payroll expenses and salary increases, social security contributions, and employee profit-**
**sharing, incentive schemes, and savings plans**

**Payroll expenses and salary increases**
Nexans’ payroll expenses in 2006 totaled 813 million euros, or 18.4% of sales at constant non-ferrous
metal prices.

A figure for the average salary increase across the entire Group would not be meaningful, because
different pay scales apply in each country. In France, which accounts for the largest proportion of
Nexans employees (18%), salaries rose by an average of just over 2% in 2006 and the standard per
employee bonus amounted to 250 euros.


-----

The compensation paid to Nexans engineers and managers has a fixed and variable portion, with the
variable portion tied to precisely-defined quantitative and qualitative targets.

**Employee profit-sharing, incentive schemes and savings plan**
Nexans employees receive additional compensation and benefits depending upon the country where
they are based. These can be in any one of several forms, including profit-sharing schemes, incentive
plans, or employee savings plans with or without employer contribution (under which the employer
may match up to 50% of the employees’ contributions.

**2006 employee share ownership plan**
In 2006, Nexans instituted an employee share ownership plan in 22 countries, following on from a
similar plan launched in 2002. The aims of the 2006 plan are:

- For Nexans: to unite its employees around shared corporate goals and build a loyal, stable
group of shareholders.
- For employees: to benefit from their Group’s growth and have a stake in its success.

This plan was approved by the Board of Directors on November 23, 2005 and was concluded
successfully on May 12, 2006. A total of 3.5 million euros was collected (triple the amount in 2002),
corresponding to 65,797 new Nexans shares purchased by 1,457 employees at a preferential price of
52.50 euros, and representing a take-up rate of 9.6%. After the transaction was completed, Nexans
employees owned 1.5% of the Company’s share capital (compared with 0.5% in 2002).

**16.2.4. Employee relations and collective agreements**

Nexans managers regularly meet with local employee representatives for both formal and informal
discussions, and have signed several collective agreements. In addition, in 2003 Nexans created the
Nexans European Work Council (Newco) to represent employees from EU member states. Newco
holds two meetings per year during which the Nexans executive management team and employee
representatives can exchange viewpoints and engage in open dialogue. These meetings are highly
informative and address the overall running of the Group. Newco is headed by Nexans’ Chairman, and
includes members of Nexans’ executive management team and 16 employee representatives appointed
by trade unions in accordance with the applicable provisions in each country covered by the
agreement.

In Germany a special agreement has been negotiated with the trades unions to reflect that country’s
challenging economic climate. This agreement aims to increase the number of working hours per week
in 2007 and 2008, and cap salary increases in order to preserve jobs.

In France, an agreement was signed under which Nexans will pay for supplemental personal risk
insurance for its non-managerial employees, and a new compensation policy was negotiated effective
from 2006.

**16.2.5. Workplace health and safety**

Workplace health and safety are top priorities for Nexans, and the Group closely monitors the
performance of its sites and their managers. Thanks to this approach, the number of workplace
accidents fell 10% in 2006, and 6 of the Group’s 79 manufacturing sites were accident-free over the
entire year.

Notable initiatives have been taken in several countries, for example:

- In Norway, the HMS i Hundre program which aims to achieve a zero accident rate by Nexans
Norway’s 100[th] anniversary in 2015 (compared with 12.5 accidents in 2005). This program was


-----

launched through a major information campaign to boost employees’ safety awareness in all their
activities, both at work and at home. The program has already proved successful with the number of
accidents at Nexans Norway dropping 32% since 2005.

- In Turkey, the Denizli and Tuzla plants have obtained OHSAS 18001 certification regarding
compliance with safety procedures. At the same time, a training program and numerous exercises have
been set up to ensure that constant attention is paid to workplace safety.

TOTAL 213,656 10,142

Time spent in training in 2006 was an average of 10 hours per person or 20 hours per trained
employee.

**16.2.7. Community initiatives**

In all countries where Nexans operates, it contributes to the local community by helping finance local
initiatives and sponsoring activities for the benefit of its employees and their families.

**16.2.8. Sourcing policy**

Nexans’ businesses rely heavily on purchases of materials, equipment, supplies, and services.
Consequently, carefully selecting suppliers and maintaining solid supplier relationships are a key
aspect of its quality control process. The Group has adopted an ethical sourcing policy based on
exacting standards to guide all its purchasing activities. For example, in order to be a Nexans certified
supplier, the supplier must demonstrate compliance with all local regulations relating to the
environment and social responsibility.

**Notes to the consolidated financial statements**

**Note 1** **Summary of significant accounting policies**

**a.** **General principles**
Nexans is a French limited liability company (société anonyme) governed by current and future law
and statutes in France applicable to commercial companies and in particular the French Commercial
Code. Nexans was formed on January 7, 1994 (under the name Atalec). Its headquarters are at 16, rue
de Monceau, 75008 Paris, and it is listed on the Paris stock exchange (compartment A of Euronext
Paris).
The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros rounded to the nearest million.
These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on January 30, 2007
and will become final upon approval by the General Shareholders’ Meeting, which will take place on
May 10, 2007.

The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements
are set out below. Except where otherwise indicated, these policies have been applied consistently to
all the financial years presented.

� **Basis of preparation**
The consolidated financial statements of the Nexans Group have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. The historical
cost convention has been applied, except for derivatives and available-for-sale financial assets, which
are measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair value risk is
hedged have been adjusted to take into account fluctuations in fair value attributable to the hedged
risks.

`o` **Amendments to published standards effective in 2006**
� IAS 19 (amendment), Employee Benefits, whose application is mandatory for all financial
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006. The updated standard introduces the option of an
alternative recognition approach for actuarial gains and losses. It may impose additional requirements
regarding the recognition of multi-employer plans if there is insufficient information to apply defined
benefit accounting. It also adds new disclosure requirements. The Group is not currently planning to
change the accounting method for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses and does not participate
in any multi-employer plans; the adoption of this amendment thus only affects the format and scope of
the disclosures presented in the financial statements.
� IAS 39 (amendment): cash flow hedges of forecast intra-group transactions.

`o` **Standards adopted early by the Group**
� IAS 1 (amendment): Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures (applicable to
financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2007).

`o` **Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2006 but not applicable to the**
**Group**
The following standards, amendments and interpretations are mandatory from January 1, 2006 but do
not apply to the Group’s business activities:
� IAS 21 (amendment): Net Investment in a Foreign Operation.
� IAS 39 (amendment): The Fair Value Option.
� IAS 39 (amendment) and IFRS 4: Financial Guarantee Contracts.
� IFRS 6: Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
� IFRIC 4: Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease.
� IFRIC 5: Rights to Interests arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental
Rehabilitation Funds.
� IFRIC 6: Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specified Market – Waste Electrical and
Electronic Equipment.


-----

`o` **Existing interpretations and standards that are not yet effective and have not been**
**adopted early by the Group**
� IFRS 7: Financial Instruments – Disclosures (applicable to financial years beginning on or
after January 1, 2007).
� IFRIC 8: Scope of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment” (applicable to financial years beginning on
or after May 1, 2006). IFRIC 8 states that IFRS 2 applies to any transaction in which an entity receives
goods or services as consideration for the issue of equity instruments of the entity as well as
transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities, in respect of goods or services received, that are based
on the price (or value) of the entity’s shares or other equity instruments. This includes transactions in
which the entity cannot specifically identify some or all of the goods received, in which case the
unidentifiable goods or services must be measured at the grant date. Such is the case when the
identifiable consideration received by the entity appears to be less than the fair value of the equity
instruments granted or liability incurred. The Group, which will apply IFRIC 8 from January 1, 2007,
does not anticipate that this standard will have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.
� IFRIC 10: Interim Financial Reporting and impairment (applicable to financial years
beginning on or after November 1, 2006). Under IFRIC 10, impairment losses recognized during an
interim period in respect of goodwill or investments in either an equity instrument or a financial asset
carried at cost cannot be reversed during a subsequent interim or annual period.

`o` **Interpretations of existing standards that are not yet effective and which do not apply to**
**the Group’s business activities**
� IFRIC 7: Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 “Financial Reporting in
Hyperinflationary Economies” (applicable to financial years beginning on or after March 1, 2006).
IFRIC 7 does not apply to the Group’s business activities as no Group entity has a currency of a
hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency.
� IFRIC 9: Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives (applicable to financial years beginning on
or after June 1, 2006). IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative should be
separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity becomes party to
the contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change to the terms of the
contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise have been required under the
contract, in which case reassessment is required. IFRIC 9 does not apply to the Group’s business
activities as no entity has changed the terms of the contracts to which it is party.

� **Estimates**
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Management to exercise its judgment and make
estimates and assumptions that impact the application of the accounting policies and the amounts of (i) assets
(impairment of goodwill, property plant and equipment and intangible assets; recognition of deferred tax
assets; valuation of margins on construction contracts), (ii) liabilities (provisions and pension obligations), and
(iii) income and expenses. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on past experience and other
factors considered reasonable under the circumstances. They serve as the basis for any judgment required for
determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities when such amounts cannot be obtained directly
from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates.

The critical judgments made by Management in applying the Group's accounting policies within the
consolidated financial statements are listed below, together with the key sources of estimation
uncertainty. They are expanded upon in the notes pertaining to the specific items.

In 2006, Management reviewed its estimates relating to:

- The recoverable amount of certain items of property, plant and equipment (in particular
following the change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories which resulted in an
increase in capital employed (see Note 1.b));

- Deferred tax assets not previously recognized relating to unused tax loss carry forwards (see
Note 9);

- The recoverable amount of goodwill (see Note 11);


-----

- The measurement of pension liabilities and other employee benefits (see Note 20);

- Provisions and contingent liabilities (see Note 28).

The impact of changes in accounting estimates is recognized over the period of the change if it
only affects that period or over the period of the change and subsequent periods if they are also
affected by the change.
Judgments made by Management and estimates presenting a significant risk of change over the
subsequent period are presented in the relevant notes.

**b.** **Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories**
Following the application of IFRS from January 1, 2004, Nexans included non-ferrous metal
inventories, referred to as core exposure, in property, plant and equipment. This asset represents the
amounts required for the Group’s plants to operate appropriately. Its volume is kept stable and its
levels are constantly replenished. For this reason, it is not hedged by forward sales contracts. As an
item of property, plant and equipment, it was stated at historical cost at January 1, 2004 and was not
depreciated as its residual value was greater than its carrying amount and due to its indefinite useful
life.
Non-ferrous metal inventories other than those representing the core exposure were recognized in
inventory and measured at purchase cost using the weighted average cost method.
The accounting policy applied is described on page 10 of the document entitled Transition to IFRS,
which accompanied the 2004 Annual Report.
When drawing up the 2006 consolidated financial statements, Nexans decided to reclassify as
inventory the amounts previously recognized under property, plant and equipment. As a result, these
amounts are now measured using the weighted average cost method. For the purposes of comparison,
the 2004 and 2005 financial statements have been restated in line with this new approach.
The policy adopted at transition to IFRS of recognizing core exposure as an item of property, plant and
equipment was designed to neutralize in the income statement the impact on core exposure of changes
in metal prices, in line with the Group’s metal risk management policy. Prior to the switch over to
IFRS, the Nexans Group used the LIFO method. The change now introduced by Nexans (use of the
weighted average cost method in the same way as for other inventory) stems from a review of IFRS
applicable to this particular case, which other European Groups faced with the same issue have also
undertaken. Given the very significant rises in non-ferrous metal prices over the past three years, the
new approach will better reflect the value of inventory in the balance sheet.
Against a background of rising non-ferrous metal prices, the revaluation of the core exposure resulting
from the use of the weighted average cost method gave rise to an increase in the working capital
requirement included in non-monetary assets which are subject to impairment tests whenever there is
an indication that they may be impaired. This led to an increase in the amount of impairment
recognized in respect of certain cash generating units at December 31, 2005.
In sum, the new core exposure accounting treatment has given rise to the following restatements of
consolidated equity at January 1, 2004, December 31, 2004 and 2005, as well as consolidated income
for 2004 and 2005:

The other changes to the 2004 and 2005 financial statements are set out in additional tables in Notes 7,
9, 11, 12 and 15.

**c.** **Consolidation methods**
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Nexans and companies
controlled by Nexans prepared at each closing date. The subsidiaries’ financial statements are
prepared for the same period as the parent company’s. Adjustments are made to harmonize any
differences in accounting methods that may exist.
**Subsidiaries (companies controlled by Nexans)** are fully consolidated from the date the Group takes
over control through the date on which control is transferred outside the Group.
Exclusive control is the direct or indirect power to govern the financial and operating policies of a
company in order to benefit from its activities.
Other companies over which the Group exercises significant influence but which are not subsidiaries or
joint ventures of the Group ("associates") are **accounted for under the equity method. Significant**
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of a company
without holding a controlling interest. Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group's
direct or indirect interest is over 20%. Investments in associates (including the related amount of
goodwill) are initially recorded on the balance sheet at cost and are subsequently adjusted for postacquisition changes in the Group’s share in the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the
value of individual investments. The consolidated income statement includes the share in net income of
associates for the period.

Intra-group balances and transactions, including any intra-group profits, are eliminated in
consolidation. Intra-group losses are also eliminated but are considered to be an indicator that the
asset may be impaired (see Note 1.o).

**d.** **Translation of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies**
The Group’s financial statements are presented in euros. The balance sheets of the Group’s foreign
operations whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros at the year-end exchange

|Attributable to minority interests|9|0 - (0)|9|
|---|---|---|---|
|Total|117|93 (28) (10)|172|


-----

rate and income statement and cash flow statement items are translated at the average annual exchange
rate. The resulting translation adjustments are included in equity under “Cumulative translation
adjustments”.
When a foreign operation is sold, any related translation adjustments recorded after the first-time
adoption of IFRS, included in “Cumulative translation adjustments”, are taken to the income
statement.
Since January 1, 2006, no Group subsidiary has been located in a “hyperinflationary” economy within
the meaning of IAS 29.

**e.** **Translation of foreign currency transactions**
Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the transaction
date. In accordance with IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates”, foreign
currency monetary items are translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date. Any related
exchange gains and losses are recorded as financial income or expense.

Foreign exchange derivatives are measured and recognized according to the principles described
in Note 1.cc.

**f.** **Business combinations**
Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method. On the first-time consolidation of a
subsidiary, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree are recognized at fair value in
compliance with IFRS 3. Goodwill arising on the acquisition is determined at the date of the takeover as
the difference between the cost of the business combination and the Group’s interest in the fair value of
the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the acquisition date (see
Note 1.l).

**g.** **Presentation of IFRS financial statements:**
In accordance with IAS 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements”, consolidated balance sheet items are
classified as current or non-current. Assets and liabilities related to the operating cycle and those that
are expected to be recovered or settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date are classified as
current, and all other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Assets and liabilities and
income and expenses are not offset, except as provided by the applicable accounting standards.
The presentation methods have been consistently applied from one year to the next.
The consolidated income statement is presented by function (rather than by nature of expenses). Total
payroll is presented in Note 4. Depreciation and amortization of non-current assets – almost exclusively
related to production activities – are included in “Cost of sales”.
The “Changes in fair value of non ferrous metal derivatives” line was created in the income statement
in compliance with IAS 32 and IAS 39 as of January 1, 2005, to separate out fair value adjustments
relating to derivatives (forward purchases and sales of metals on organized markets, and on the LME in
particular) from changes in fair value of the risks hedged in the underlying commercial contracts.

**h.** **Sales**
**Net sales**
Net sales (at current metal prices) represent sales of goods and services deriving from the Group’s main
activities net of value added taxes (VAT). In accordance with IAS 18, revenue is recognized when the
risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the buyer and the amount of the revenue
can be reliably measured. Sales are measured at the fair value of the consideration received or due, which
takes into account the financial impact of payment deferrals when they are significant.
According to IAS 11, a construction contract is a contract specifically negotiated for the construction of
an asset or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design,
technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use. They essentially cover the Group’s highvoltage cable and umbilical cable activities. Sales and revenue from construction contracts are
recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. The percentage of completion is determined based on
technical milestones defined in the contract or on the costs incurred compared to total estimated costs for
the contract. When it is probable that total costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is


-----

recognized immediately in cost of sales. Work in progress on construction contracts is stated at
production cost, excluding administrative and selling expenses and interest expense. Changes in
provisions for penalties are charged to sales. For each construction contract, the amount of costs incurred
plus profits recognized is compared to the sum of losses recognized and intermediate billings. If the
balance obtained is positive, it is included in assets under “Amounts due from customers on construction
contracts” and if it is negative it is recorded under “Amounts due to customers on construction contracts”
in liabilities.
**Net sales at constant metal prices (and cost of sales at constant metal prices)**
On an operating level, the effects of fluctuations in the purchase price of metals are passed on in the
selling price.
To neutralize the effect of fluctuations of non-ferrous metal prices and thus measure the underlying
trend in its business, the Group presents the sales figure based on a constant price for copper and
aluminum (the cost of sales figure is adjusted in the same way). These reference prices have been fixed
at 1,500 euros per metric ton for copper and 1,200 euros per metric ton for aluminum.

**i.** **Operating margin**
Operating margin measures the Group's operating performance and includes gross profit,
administrative and selling expenses, research and development costs (see Note 1.k), share-based
payments, pension operating costs (see Note 1.u) and employee profit sharing.

It is measured before the impact of the core exposure (see below), changes in fair value of non-ferrous
metal derivatives, financial income and expense, restructuring costs, gains and losses on asset disposals, net
asset impairment and negative goodwill, income tax as well as share in net income of associates and net
income from discontinued operations.

**j.** **Core exposure impact**
The core exposure impact relates to the change, during the period, in the value of the core exposure
calculated on the basis of the weighted average cost. As this impact results from the change described
in Note 1.b. it is excluded from operating margin, in line with the Group’s business model (see
Note 24.c).

**k.** **Research and development costs**
Expenditure on research activities is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs are recognized as an intangible asset provided the following can be demonstrated:

- The technical and industrial feasibility of the project;

- Nexans’ intention to complete the project and to use or market the ensuing products;

- The existence of a potential market (with adequate assurance in terms of volume and price) for the
output of the product resulting from the project, or the product’s internal usefulness;

- The availability of adequate resources required to complete the project;

- The ability to reliably measure the related costs.
These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the project concerned, from the date the
related product is made available.
Research and development costs to be rebilled to customers under the terms of construction contracts are
included in "Amounts due from (or due to) customers on construction contracts".

**l.** **Goodwill**
In compliance with IFRS 3 “Business combinations”, goodwill is not amortized; instead it is tested at
least annually for impairment – in the last quarter of the year – and whenever there is an indication
that it may be impaired. These tests are performed by legal entity, by determining the sum of the
recoverable amounts for each of the Cash Generating Units (CGU) comprising the entity and
performing a global comparison to the total carrying amount of the assets of that entity. The
impairment test methods are described in Note 1.o). When the recoverable amount of the CGU or
group of CGUs is lower than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded in the income
statement under “Net asset impairment and negative goodwill”. This impairment is allocated first to
reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit


-----

pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Impairment losses on goodwill
cannot be reversed.
After verifying the identification process of the assets and liabilities acquired and their valuation, any
negative goodwill is immediately booked in the income statement.
Any acquisition of an additional stake in a company that is already controlled results in the recognition
of goodwill for the difference between the price paid and the amount of the minority interest acquired.

**m.** **Put options given to minority shareholders**
In compliance with IAS 32, put options given to minority shareholders in subsidiaries are recognized
as financial liabilities at their discounted value. The offsetting entry for these financial liabilities,
beyond the derecognition of the corresponding minority interests, is not clearly specified in the
applicable standards. Pending IFRIC guidance, and based on current standard market practice, the
Group opted to record in goodwill the difference between the discounted value of the exercise price of
the options and the amount of minority interests removed from equity. This goodwill is adjusted each
year to reflect the change in the exercise price of the options and the change in minority interests. This
treatment, which has no impact on net income for the period, best reflects the reality of the transaction,
to the extent that it corresponds to the treatment that would be applied if the options were exercised
immediately. However, if any interpretations or standards are issued that do not permit such treatment
it will have to be modified accordingly.

**n.** **Property plant and equipment and intangible assets (excluding goodwill)**
Property plant and equipment and intangible assets are stated at cost less any accumulated
amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. When they are acquired under a business
combination, their cost is identified as their fair value.
Intangible assets primarily correspond to the costs for acquired or developed software, usually
intended for internal use, to the extent that their cost can be reliably measured and they are likely to
generate future economic benefits. These assets are amortized by the straight-line method over their
estimated useful lives (generally three years).
Property plant and equipment is depreciated by the straight-line method based on the following
expected useful lives:

**Industrial buildings and equipment:**
– Buildings for industrial use 20 years
– Infrastructure and fixtures 10-20 years
– Equipment and machinery

- Heavy mechanical components 30 years

- Medium mechanical components 20 years

- Light mechanical components 10 years

- Electrical and electronic components 10 years
– Small equipment and tools 3 years
**Buildings for administrative and commercial use** **20-40 years**

The depreciation method and periods are reviewed each year-end. The residual value of the assets
is taken into account in the depreciable amount when it is deemed significant. Replacement costs
are capitalized to the extent that they satisfy the criteria in IAS 16.
Property plant and equipment and intangible assets are derecognized when the risks and rewards
of ownership of the asset are transferred or when there is no future economic benefit expected
from the asset’s use or sale. Any gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an asset (difference
between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income
statement for the year the asset is derecognized (on the line “Gains or losses on asset disposals”).
In compliance with the treatment recommended in IAS 23, borrowing costs are recognized as
expenses during the period they are incurred.
Assets acquired through lease arrangements that have the features of a financing are capitalized.
Leases under which a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership is retained by the


-----

lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of benefits
received from the lessor) are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

**o.** **Impairment tests**
At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses where there is an indication that an asset may be
impaired. When events or changes in the market environment indicate a risk of impairment of
property plant and equipment or intangible assets, these assets are tested for impairment. An
impairment loss is recognized where necessary for the amount by which the asset’s carrying
amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair
value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is calculated on the basis of future operating
cash flow representing Management’s best estimate of the economic conditions that will prevail
during the remainder of the asset’s useful life. The assumptions are made on the basis of past
experience and external factors, such as discount rates and non-ferrous metal future prices.
The Group carries out impairment tests on each cash generating unit in accordance with IAS 36, as
follows:

- Cash Generating Units (CGU) chosen: product lines within each legal entity;

- Discount rate corresponding to the expected market rate of return for a similar investment, specific to
each geographical zone, regardless of the sources of financing (see Note 7);

- Five-year business plans;

- The impact of changes in non-ferrous metal prices on future operating cash flows, determined on the
basis of 5-year metal futures prices, and assuming that the current hedging policy will be continued;

- Extrapolation of cash flows beyond 5 years based on a growth rate of 2%.

Impairment losses (net of reversals) are recorded in the income statement under "Net asset impairment
and negative goodwill".

**p.** **Inventories and work in progress**
Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The costs
incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and conditions can be analyzed as
follows:

- Raw materials: purchase cost according to the Weighted Average Cost (WAC) method;

- Finished goods and work in progress: cost of materials and direct labor and share of indirect
production costs according to the Weighted Average Cost (WAC) method.

The net realizable value is the estimated sale price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated
completion costs and the costs necessary to carry out the sale. In compliance with the benchmark
method in IAS 23, inventories do not include borrowing costs, which are expensed in the period
they are incurred.

Inventories include core exposure, which represents the amounts required for the Group’s plants to
operate appropriately. Its volume is kept stable and its levels are constantly replenished. Changes to
this component of inventory are shown in a separate line of the income statement (see Note 1.j above)
and are included as a component of cash flow from operating activities in the cash flow statement.

**q.** **Trade receivables**
Trade receivables are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the cost
method. Interest free short-term operating receivables are recognized at the amount of the original
invoice as discounting has no material impact.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is recorded whenever there is an objective
indication that the Group will not be able to collect the full amounts due under the conditions
originally provided for at the time of the transaction. The following are indicators of impairment of a
receivable: (i) the debtor facing major financial difficulties, (ii) the probability that the debtor will
undergo bankruptcy or a financial restructuring, and (iii) a payment default. The amount of the
provision represents the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and the estimated value
of future cash flows, discounted at the initial effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is


-----

written down and the amount of the loss is recognized in the income statement under “Administrative
and selling expenses”. Where a receivable is irrecoverable, it is derecognized and offset by the reversal
of the provision for the impairment of receivables. When a previously derecognized receivable is
recovered the amount is credited to “Administrative and selling expenses” in the income statement.

**r.** **Equity**
In addition to the capital stock and additional paid-in capital of the parent company, consolidated equity
includes the following:

- “Consolidated retained earnings”, including the Group’s share in the retained earnings of its
consolidated companies since the first-time consolidation date;

- “Changes in fair value and other”, which primarily includes (i) the changes in market value of
derivatives designated as hedges of future cash flows (see note 1.cc), and (ii) available-for-sale
financial assets (see Note 1.y);

- “Cumulative translation adjustments”, used to record currency translation adjustments deriving from
the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries (as from January 1, 2004 – the
Group’s first-time adoption of IFRS);

- Minority interests.

It is Group policy to account for transactions with minority interests in the same manner as
transactions with unrelated third parties. Disposals to minority interests give rise to the realization of
gains and losses that the Group recognizes in the income statement. The acquisition of shares from
minority interests gives rise to goodwill for the difference between the price paid and the interest
acquired corresponding to the carrying amount of the net assets.

The additional costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are recognized in equity
as a deduction from the proceeds of the issue, net of tax.
Dividend payouts to the Group’s shareholders are recognized as a debt in the Group’s financial
statements during the period in which the dividends are approved by the Group’s shareholders.

**s.** **Treasury stock**
The acquisition cost of treasury shares is deducted from equity. Gains and losses on the sale of these
shares do not contribute to the period’s net income.

**t.** **Share-based payments**
Stock options are granted to managers and certain Group employees. In accordance with IFRS 2
"Share-based Payment", options are measured at fair value at the grant date, using the Black &
Scholes option pricing model. Any changes in value after the grant date do not affect the recognized
amounts.
The value of an option primarily depends on market data at the grant date (price and volatility of the
share, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends) and on its expected life – an assumption that is
determined by the Group taking into account various parameters including minimum holding periods
prescribed by law. The value of granted options is recorded in payroll expenses on a straight-line basis
from the grant date to the end of the vesting period, with a direct offsetting entry in equity.

**u.** **Pensions, statutory retirement bonuses and other employee benefits**
In accordance with the laws and practices of each country where Nexans is present, the Group
provides pensions, early retirement benefits and statutory retirement bonuses. For basic and other
defined contribution pension plans, expenses correspond to contributions made. No provision is
recognized, as the Group has no obligation beyond the contributions paid.
For defined benefit pension and similar plans, provisions are determined as follows:

- Using the Projected Unit Credit method, which sees each service period as giving rise to an
additional unit of benefit entitlement and measures each unit separately to build up the final obligation.
These calculations take into account assumptions with respect to mortality, staff turnover, discounting
and projection of future salaries.


-----

- Actuarial gains and losses – corresponding to experience adjustments and the effects of changes in
actuarial assumptions – occurring since January 1, 2004 are not immediately recognized in the income
statement, in application of the corridor method. Under this method, actuarial gains and losses that
exceed 10% of the greater of the plan defined benefit obligation and the fair value of corresponding
plan assets are amortized over the expected average remaining working lives of the participating
employees.

- When the calculation of the benefit obligation results in an asset for the Group, the recognized
amount cannot exceed the total net amount of the following: (i) unrecognized cumulative net actuarial
losses and unrecognized past service costs and (ii) the present value of available refunds and
reductions in future contributions to the plan.

The financial component of the annual pension expense (interest cost after deduction of expected
return on plan assets) is included in financial expense (see Note 5).

Provisions for jubilees and other long-term benefits paid during the employees’ service are valued
based on actuarial calculations comparable to the calculations for pension benefits, without any
possibility of deferring the related actuarial gains and losses. They are included in the balance sheet
under “Provisions”.

**v.** **Provisions**
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) resulting
from a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will
be required to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of discounting is material, the provisions are determined by discounting expected future
cash flows applying a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of
money. The discounting impact is recognized in financial income and expense and the effects of any
rate fluctuations are recognized in the same account for which the provision was accrued.

A provision is set aside to fully cover restructuring costs when it relates to an obligation by the Group
to another party resulting from a Management or Board decision, communicated before the balance
sheet date to those affected by it. Such costs primarily relate to severance payments, early retirement,
costs for unworked notice periods, training costs of employees whose employment contracts have been
terminated, and other costs linked to the shutdown of facilities. Asset retirements and impairment of
inventories and other assets directly linked to restructuring measures are also recorded under
restructuring costs in the income statement.

**w.** **Deferred tax**
Deferred taxes are computed under the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the
book carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for tax losses available for
carryforward. However, deferred income tax assets are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet only if
it seems reasonably probable that the tax benefit will be realized, based on the business plan of the
company concerned (see Note 9).
All amounts resulting from changes to the tax rate are recorded in equity or in net income in the year in
which the tax rate change is decided, based on the initial recognition method for the corresponding
deferred taxes
Deferred taxes related to likely distributions of dividends of subsidiaries and affiliates are recognized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if the entity is legally entitled to offset current tax assets and
liabilities and if the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation
authority.

**x.** **Assets held for sale**

**Presentation in the balance sheet**
Non-current assets or groups of assets held for sale, as defined by IFRS 5, are presented under assets
on a separate line. Liabilities related to groups of assets held for sale are shown on the liabilities side,


-----

also on a separate line. Non-current assets classified as assets held for sale cease to be depreciated from
the date on which they fulfill the classification criteria for assets held for sale.

**Presentation in the income statement**
A group of assets sold, held for sale or whose operations have been discontinued is a component of the
entity if:

- It represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations,

- It is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical
area of operations, or

- It is a subsidiary acquired exclusively for resale.

Where a group of assets sold, held for sale or whose operations have been discontinued is a
component of the entity, its income and expenses are presented on a separate line of the income
statement (net income from discontinued operations) comprising the total of:

- The post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations, and

- The post-tax gain or loss recognized on the measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the
disposal of the asset or groups of assets held for sale constituting the discontinued operation.

When a group of assets previously presented as "held for sale" ceases to satisfy the criteria in IFRS 5,
each related asset and liability component is reclassified in the consolidated balance sheet.

**y.** **Financial assets**
Financial assets are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the
acquisition.
At subsequent reporting dates measurement and recognition depend on the classification of the financial
asset concerned:

- Cash equivalents are recorded at amortized cost.

- Other investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. At each balance sheet date, the
fair value of investments quoted in an active financial market is determined by reference to the
published market price. Changes in fair value are recorded in equity on a separate line and are
included in income upon disposal of the asset.

- For investments in non-consolidated entities for which there is no published active market price, the
fair value is determined by reference to the current market value of another substantially identical
instrument or calculated based on the cash flows expected from the asset. If there is no reliable
valuation method, assets are carried at cost.

- Loans and receivables are recorded at amortized cost by applying the effective interest rate.

For the last three categories, if there is an objective indication of impairment of the financial asset
(particularly a significant or lasting decrease in the value of the asset), an impairment loss is recorded.
This impairment loss cannot be reversed in net income in the case of equity instruments classified as
available-for-sale financial assets (nor can it be reversed for unlisted investments recorded at cost).

A financial asset is derecognized when the Group does not expect further financial flows from it and
transfers to a third party substantially all of the related risks and rewards.

**z.** **Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents – whose changes are shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows –
comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value.

**aa.** **Financial liabilities**
Financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value less attributable transaction costs. If the liability
is issued at a premium or discount, the premium or discount is amortized over the life of the liability
using the effective interest method. The effective interest method calculates the interest rate that is


-----

necessary to discount the stream of principal and interest cash flows to the initial amount of the
liability.

**bb.** **Hybrid instruments – OCEANE bonds**
In compliance with IAS 32 “Financial Instruments: Presentation”, if a financial instrument has both a
liability and an equity component, the issuer shall account for these components separately according
to their nature.
This treatment applies to OCEANE bonds convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for
existing shares, with the conversion option meeting the definition of an equity instrument.
The liability component is measured on the issue date on the basis of contractual future cash flows
discounted applying the market rate (taking into account the issuer’s credit risk) for a similar
instrument but which is not convertible/redeemable into shares.
The value of the conversion option is calculated as the difference between the issue price of the bonds
and the value of the liability component. This amount is recognized in an equity account.
Following initial measurement of the liability and equity components, the liability component is
measured at amortized cost.
The interest expense relating to the liability is calculated using the effective interest method,
determined based on the prevailing market rate for non-convertible bonds.

**cc.** **Financial instruments**

**Foreign currency hedges**
The Group uses derivatives (forward purchases and sales of foreign currencies) to hedge the risk of
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These instruments are measured at fair value,
calculated by reference to the prevailing forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity
profiles.
When these operations hedge highly probable future transactions (forecast cash flows or firm
orders) that have not yet been invoiced, and to the extent that they satisfy the conditions for cash
flow hedge accounting, the change in the fair value of the derivative comprises two elements: the
“effective” portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the hedge, which is recognized directly in
equity, and the “ineffective” portion, which is recognized in financial income. Any gains or losses
previously recognized in equity are taken to the income statement in the period in which the hedged
firm commitment impacts income, for example when the forecast sale is recorded on the balance
sheet as a foreign currency receivable.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded directly in
the income statement.

**Hedging of risks associated with fluctuations in non-ferrous metal prices**
The Group uses forward purchase and sale contracts executed primarily on the London Metal Exchange
(LME) in order to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of non-ferrous metals (copper and
aluminum).

The increased volatility in non-ferrous metal prices over the past few months has led the Group to
implement measures in order that a significant portion of these derivatives being classified as cash
flow hedges, within the meaning of IAS 39. Consequently, since November 1, 2006, where these
instruments hedge highly probable future transactions (copper cathode purchases) that have not yet
been invoiced, and to the extent that they satisfy the criteria for applying cash flow hedge accounting,
they are accounted for in a similar manner to the foreign currency instruments described above: the
"effective" portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in
equity, and the "ineffective" portion is recognized in “Changes in fair value of non-ferrous metal
derivatives”. The gains or losses previously recognized in equity are taken to the income statement in
the period in which the hedged item (i.e. the purchase of the copper cathodes) affects income.

Changes in fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized directly in
income or loss for the period.


-----

**Note 2** **Changes in the scope of consolidation**

The main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2006 were as follows:
- On December 1, 2006, Nexans acquired 100% of the Australian group Olex, the cable industry
leader in Australasia, for 515 million Australian dollars (around 310 million euros). Olex’s sales for
2006 amounted to around 330 million euros at current copper prices, generating an operating margin
of approximately 13%. Olex has only been consolidated since December 31, 2006, as the company’s
impact on the Group’s sales, operating margin and net income for the year was not material.
- During the second half of 2006, Nexans founded a Japanese subsidiary, Nippon High Voltage
Cable Corp. (NVC), of which it owns 66%, the remaining 34% being held by Viscas (JV Furukawa
Electric Co., Ltd. and Fujikura Ltd), which transferred its existing factory in Tokyo Bay to NVC. NVC
has been consolidated since December 31, 2006. It will be dedicated to producing high-voltage
undersea cables exclusively for its two shareholders and will not carry out any other commercial
activities.
- Nexans increased its interests in its Korean subsidiaries, Nexans Korea and Kukdong Electrical
Wire to 99.5% and 97.9% respectively.
- On February 1, 2006, Nexans disposed of its Swiss distribution business (Electro-Matériel SA) for
206 million euros, generating a capital gain of 149 million euros. In 2005, Electro-Matériel SA
generated sales of 189 million euros, EBITDA (before contribution to head office costs) of
21.3 million euros and an operating margin (on the same basis) in excess of 18 million euros. In terms
of sales and operating margin it contributed 16 million euros and 1 million euros, respectively, in
January 2006.
- In January 2006, Nexans acquired 100% of the Confecta Group, one of the leading International
specialists in high value-added harnesses for the rail industry. Consolidated from January 2006, the
Confecta Group generated sales of 27 million euros in 2006 and operating margin of close to 1 million
euros.
- In Vietnam, Nexans founded Nexans Lioa in which it holds a 60% stake, the remaining 40%
being held by two Vietnamese companies, which contributed in the form of an asset transfer of their
manufacturing activities for the power cable, equipment cable and industrial cable markets. This new
entity, consolidated from May 2006, is in the process of starting up.

The main changes in the scope of consolidation for 2005 were as follows:
- Nexans' winding wires business in Europe was transferred to Essex Nexans, a company founded
together with the Superior Essex Group, in which Nexans retained a 41% minority stake (reduced to
40% in early 2006). Essex Nexans was accounted using the equity method from October 21, 2005.
Income up to the transfer was recorded as income from discontinued operations in line with IFRS 5
(see Note 8).
- Nexans sold its Norwegian distribution subsidiary Nexans Distribusjon on August 28, 2005,
for 45 million euros, generating a net capital gain of 33 million euros. This company contributed
75 million euros to 2005 sales (8 months).

The main changes in the scope of consolidation in 2004 were as follows:
- Takeover of the Liban Câbles Group (including its Egyptian subsidiary, ICC), fully consolidated
since July 2004;
- Purchase of the Italian company Cabloswiss, fully consolidated since September 1, 2004;
- Disposal in September 2004 of the Group’s winding wires production activities in the United
States.

**Note 3** **Information by business segment and by geographical area**

Information by business segment is broken down as follows:

- By business – the Group’s primary reporting format – as risks and rates of return are mainly
affected by the differences among the products offered;

- And by geographical area.


-----

Generally speaking, transfer prices among the various businesses are identical to those prevailing for
transactions with parties outside the Group.
Data relating to the business segments is based on the same accounting policies as those used for the
consolidated financial statements, as described in the notes to the financial statements. Figures for 2006
were prepared subsequent to the change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories
(see Note 1.b). 2005 figures have been restated to reflect the impact of this change, whereas 2004 data
is presented as previously reported.
The performance of each business segment is measured based on operating margin.
This data does not include discontinued operations, which are presented separately in Note 8.
The tables below relate to the following business segments:

- Electrical wires - comprising wirerods, electrical wires and the winding wires production business
that is not in the process of being sold.

- Energy - including equipment cables (comprising the cables themselves and two distribution
companies in Switzerland and Norway, through the disposal date for the latter) power cables for
energy networks (low, medium, high voltage and related accessories) and special cables.

- Telecom - which groups cables for private telecommunications networks, special cables for
electronic applications, junction components for telecommunication network cables, and copper and
optical fiber cables for public telecommunication networks.

- Other - mainly comprising head office profits and costs not allocated to operations and intersegment eliminations of trade receivables.

**Net** **asset** **impairment** **and** **negative**

As described in Note 1.b, the revaluation of core exposure resulting from the use of the weighted
average cost method gave rise to an increase in the working capital requirement included in nonmonetary assets which are subject to impairment tests whenever there is an indication that they may be
impaired. This led to an increase in the amount of impairment recognized in respect of certain cash
generating units at December 31, 2005.
Impairment losses recorded in 2005 related primarily to the special cables for electronic applications
business in Belgium, the industrial cable business in Switzerland and Belgium, the private network
cable business in the United Kingdom and the telecom infrastructure cable business in Spain. Reversals
of impairment losses related to the general market business in France, the telecom infrastructure cable
business in Morocco and the metallurgy business in China.
In the restated 2005 financial statements, additional impairment losses were recognized in respect of
the special cables for electronic applications business in France and Brazil, the special cables business
in Germany and Switzerland and certain support assets in Germany. The Group also recognized
goodwill impairment in relation to Nexans Inc and Nexans Brazil (see Note 11).
The 109 million euros in impairment losses for 2006 primarily relate to the Group’s upstream
businesses (wirerods, electrical wires and the remainder of the winding wires business in Canada and
China) where capital employed was particularly impacted by the rise in raw material prices. They also
concern the energy infrastructure cable businesses in Germany, Italy, Greece, Egypt and South Korea.
These changes led to the recognition of impairment losses of 19 million euros relating to the goodwill
of Liban Câbles, ICC (Egypt), Nexans Tianjin and Nexans Inc. Conversely, the turnaround in the
industrial cables business in Switzerland and Germany, the special cables for electronic applications
business in France and Turkey and the building cables business in the United States enabled the Group
to reverse 27 million euros worth of impairment losses.

**Note 8** **Discontinued operations and assets held for sale**

At December 31, 2006 negotiations were underway to dispose of the Group’s remaining winding
wires businesses in Canada and China (see Note 30). In accordance with IFRS 5, the balance sheet
items relating to this component were reclassified in Nexans’ consolidated balance sheet at
December 31, 2006, along with those operations that have been divested or discontinued (i.e. the
remaining assets and liabilities of the Italian winding wires business closed at end 2005) and are now
shown on two lines – “Assets and groups of assets held for sale” on the assets side and “Liabilities
related to groups of assets held for sale” on the liabilities side. However, as the above transaction does
not comply with the separate presentation rules for the income statement prescribed in IFRS 5, the
income for these two entities is included line by line in the Group’s income statement under
continuing operations.
At December 31, 2005 the above-described balance sheet headings also included the assets and
liabilities of Electro-Matriel, which was disposed of on February 1, 2006 (see Note 2). At
December 31, 2004, it included the assets and liabilities of the European winding wires business
(“European business”).
In the income statement, the European winding wires businesses that were divested (“European
business”) or discontinued (“Italian business”) during 2005 are shown on a single line called “Net
income/(loss) from discontinued operations”, and the 2004 comparative data was restated accordingly.

Deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards are recognized for companies whose business plan indicates
that they will generate taxable income in the future against which the loss carryforwards will be deductible.
Deferred tax assets that were not recognized because recovery was deemed uncertain amounted to
332 million euros, 399 million euros and 382 million euros at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. These deferred tax assets primarily include the tax loss carryforwards described in
Note d) below.

**d)** **Tax loss carryforwards**
Tax losses carried forward and not yet utilized represented a potential tax saving of 320 million euros
at December 31, 2006 (422 million euros and 417 million euros at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively), including 205 million euros relating to the Group’s German subsidiaries (279 million
euros and 269 million euros at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) and 55 million euros
relating to French subsidiaries (76 million euros and 81 million euros at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
respectively). The business plans updated during the course of 2006 resulted in an increase in deferred
tax assets recognized in respect of tax loss carryforwards from 47 million euros to 52 million euros,
including 23 million euros for the German subsidiaries (16 million euros at end 2005 and 2004) and
25 million euros for the French subsidiaries (20 million euros in the restated 2005 financial statements,
and 14 million euros at end 2004). In these two countries, tax losses can be carried forward
indefinitely.

**Note 10** **Earnings per share**

Basic earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of shares
outstanding, after deducting the weighted average number of shares held by consolidated companies.
Diluted earnings per share take into account share equivalents that have a dilutive effect. Net income is
adjusted for after-tax interest expense relating to convertible or exchangeable bonds. The dilutive
impact of stock subscription and/or purchase options is calculated using the treasury stock method,
which assumes that the proceeds received at the time of exercise or purchase will be used first and
foremost to purchase shares at market price. The dilutive effects of OCEANE bonds that are
convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares are calculated assuming that the
bonds will be systematically converted or exchanged for shares (the "if converted method").

The following table presents a reconciliation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per

_*** see Note 1.b_

During 2006, additional goodwill recorded in the financial statements arose from the following transactions
(see Note 2):
- The December 1, 2006 acquisition of the Australian group Olex – Australasia’s cable industry leader –
for around 310 million euros; goodwill amounted to 184 million euros but may need to be adjusted in the
12 months following the acquisition;
- The takeover of the Confecta Group in January 2006, generating goodwill of 8 million euros.

Other changes mainly stem from translation adjustments.

During 2005, apart from the impact of translation adjustments, the main change in goodwill was due to
the inclusion of the put option granted to minority shareholders in the Liban Câbles Group in
connection with the first-time adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39.

During 2004, additional recognized goodwill related to the takeover of the Liban Câbles Group, the
purchase of the Italian company Cabloswiss and the Group’s purchase of an additional interest in the
Belgian company Euromold.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least once a year and whenever there is an indication that it may
be impaired, using the methods and assumptions described in Notes 1.l, 1.o and 7.

Câbles.

In the restated 2005 financial statements, additional goodwill impairment losses were recognized in
relation to Nexans Inc and Nexans Brazil (see Note 7).

**Note 19** **Equity**

**a)** **Composition of capital stock**
Nexans’ capital stock comprises 25,264,955 fully paid-up shares (23,507,322 shares at December 31,
2005), with a par value of 1 euro each, of which 279,240 shares carry double voting rights, bringing
the number of voting rights to 25,544,195.

**b)** **Dividends**
At the Ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting, shareholders will be invited to approve the payment of
a 1.20 euro dividend per share. If approved, the aggregate amount of dividends payable would be
30,317,946 euros based on capital stock comprising 25,264,955 shares at December 31, 2006.
In the event that Nexans holds treasury stock at the time the dividend is paid out, the amount
corresponding to unpaid dividends on these shares shall be appropriated to retained earnings. The
total amount of the dividend could be increased in order to reflect the number of additional shares that
may be issued between January 1, 2007 and the date of the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting, following,
fro instance, the exercise of stock options.
The Ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on May 15, 2006 to approve the financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 authorized the payment of a dividend of 1 euro per
share, which was paid on May 19, 2006.
The Ordinary Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on June 2, 2005 to approve the financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2004 authorized the payment of a dividend of 0.50 euro per share
paid out on June 7, 2005.

**c)** **Treasury stock**
Following the cancellation of all the 2,221,199 treasury shares held at December 31, 2005, Nexans no
longer held any of its shares at December 31, 2006. As these shares were deducted from equity at the
previous balance sheet date, their cancellation had no impact on income or on total equity.

**d)** **Stock options**
At December 31, 2006, there were 1,462,775 stock options outstanding, each entitling the holder to
subscribe to one share, _i.e. 5.8% of the capital stock (1,498,650 options at December 31, 2005,_
entitling subscription of 6.4% of the capital stock). These options can be analyzed as follows:

-----

Options granted prior to November 7, 2002 and which had not vested at January 1, 2005 were not
valued and remain unrecognized. The first tranche of the plan dated April 4, 2003 does not fall within
the scope of IFRS 2, since the rights were fully vested prior to January 1, 2005.
The estimated life of options is determined specifically taking into account tax law applicable to
option beneficiaries. The volatility considered was determined by reference to the historic volatility of
Nexans’ share over the last 3 years. The options vest by tranche one quarter at a time over four years
from the grant date.
The fair value of the options is recorded as a payroll expense on a straight-line basis from the grant
date to the end of the vesting period, with a direct offsetting entry in shareholders equity. For 2006, a
3.4 million euros expense was recognized on the IFRS income statement (2.4 million euros in 2005
and 0.8 million euros in 2004).

**e)** **Put options granted to minority shareholders**
Nexans' commitment to buy the shares of minority shareholders in the Liban Câbles group
(representing 7% of the capital stock) is considered as a financial liability under IAS 32. This put is
recognized under debt in the amount of 4 million euros, the offsetting entry being the minority
interest line in the amount of 1 million euros. The 3 million euro balance is recognized as goodwill.
This was partially impaired at December 31, 2006 (see Note 7).

**f)** **Equity component of the OCEANE bonds**
Under IAS 32, the portion of the OCEANE bonds issued in July 2006 that corresponds to the value of
the option is included in equity for an amount of 34 million euros.

**Note 20** **Pensions and other post-employment benefit obligations**

There are a large number of retirement schemes in place within the Group. In France, each Group
employee is eligible for the statutory retirement scheme and statutory retirement bonus paid by the
employer. In other countries, retirement schemes are subject to local legislation, and to the business
and historical practices of the subsidiary concerned.
Actuarial assumptions are applied to defined benefit schemes, with basic assumptions applied to each
country and specific assumptions applied on an individual company basis, such as staff turnover rate
and estimated future increases in salary. The assumptions used for 2006, 2005 and 2004 are set out in
the table below, with the average weighted rates split out by geographical area.

The discount rates applied were determined by reference to market yields on high-quality corporate
bonds. In those countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market yields on government
bonds were used. The term of the corporate bonds or government bonds is consistent with the term of
the relevant retirement scheme.
The expected long-term return on plan assets was estimated by reference to the composition of the
portfolio and the maturity of the assets.

_(1) including classification as liabilities related to groups of assets held for sale (IFRS 5)_

Accrued contract costs relate primarily to provisions set up by the Group as part of the Group’s
contractual responsibilities, and in particular warranties, contract losses and penalties relating to
commercial contracts (see Note 28 on contingent liabilities and disputes).
Surplus provisions are reversed when the risks no longer exist or if they have been settled for a lower
amount than the estimate based on information available at the prior balance sheet date (including
provisions for expired warranties).

**b)** **Analysis of restructuring costs**

Restructuring costs incurred largely concern the closure of 3 plants affecting 123 employees at the
Opglabbeek site (Belgium), 93 employees at the Abbey Wood site (United Kingdom) and 34
employees at the TLM site in Marseille. Other smaller plans were implemented to cut capacity in
particular in Italy, France, Germany and Spain.
During 2005, restructuring costs for which provisions were accrued primarily related to staff
reductions in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain.
Restructuring costs in 2004 mainly concerned staff reductions in Germany, Italy, Spain, France and
the United States.

**c)** **OCEANE bonds**

On June 16, 2006, Nexans redeemed in advance the OCEANE convertible/exchangeable bonds issued
in July 2004. Substantially all of the OCEANE bondholders exercised their option to receive shares, at
a ratio of one Nexans share per OCEANE bond. A total of 3,534,160 OCEANE bonds were therefore
converted into shares, with the remaining 18,472 being redeemed at their nominal value of 38 euros.
The conversion of the OCEANE bonds resulted in a 110 million euro reduction in consolidated debt
(taking into account the 1.8 euro adjustment payment made per bond to OCEANE bondholders) and a
117 million euro increase in consolidated equity.
On July 7, 2006, Nexans carried out another OCEANE bond issue for an aggregate nominal amount of
280 million euros. The debt comprises 3,794,037 bonds, each with a nominal value of 73.8 euros,
bearing interest of 1.5% and redeemable at a price of 85.76 euros on January 1, 2013. In accordance
with IAS 32, the portion of the OCEANE bonds relating to the value of the option is included in
equity, in the amount of 34 million euros.

The syndicated loan agreement is subject to standard covenants (negative pledge, pari-passu, cross
default) and financial ratio covenants (net debt/EBITDA < 2.95, and net debt/equity including
minority interests < 1.15). At December 31, 2006, and at the date the Board of Directors approved the
financial statements, these ratios were well within the specified limits.
If these covenants are not complied with, the undrawn portion of the lines would become
unavailable and any borrowing authorizations given would be revoked, either immediately or
after 30 days depending on the nature of the covenant.

**f)** **Fair value of gross debt**
The Group's fixed-rate debt primarily comprises the liability component of the OCEANE bonds,
whose fair value at December 31, 2006 was 247 million euros for a carrying amount of 246 million
euros.

**g)** **Collateral granted**
Collateral granted by the Group to secure borrowings amounted to 11 million euros at
December 31, 2006 (15 million euros at December 31, 2005 and 26 million euros at December 31,
2004).

"Other current financial liabilities" includes other operating and non-operating liabilities; derivative
instruments correspond to foreign exchange derivatives and non-ferrous metals forward contracts
whose fair value represents an unrealized loss (see Note 25).
The fair value of these financial liabilities is identical to their carrying amount.

**Note 24** **Financial risks**

The Group Treasury and Metals Department centralizes foreign exchange and interest rate risk
management as well as cash management for subsidiaries located in countries where regulations so
permit. A centralized cash management system which pools subsidiaries’ liquid resources optimizes
the use of these resources as subsidiaries’ credit balances in the main currencies are transferred to the
parent company’s central cash pooling accounts.
The key subsidiaries that do not have access to the centralized cash management system are located
in Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, China, South Korea, Vietnam and Brazil. These subsidiaries,
which have their own banking relationships, are nevertheless subject to Group procedures in respect of
their choice of banks as well as the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risks and the
hedging of their non-ferrous metal risks.
The Group’s Financing Department, which is part of the Finance Department, is responsible for all
issues relating to the management of liquidity, foreign exchange and interest rate risks. The nonferrous metal risk management policy is defined and controlled by the Group Treasury and Metals
Department and implemented by the subsidiaries buying copper and aluminum.

**a)** **Interest rate risk**
Nexans pays close attention to the trend of interest rates in order to set up – where appropriate –
suitable hedging instruments.
At December 31, 2006, Nexans did not have any interest rate hedges.

**Overnight** **1 to 5** **>** **5**
_In millions of euros_ **to 1 year** **years** **years**
Financial assets 288   -   Financial liabilities 677 2 247
Net position before hedging (389) (2) (247)
Hedging (off-balance sheet)   -   -   Net position after hedging (389) (2) (247)

The Group’s short-term debt is variable rate based on monetary indices (EONIA, Euribor or Libor).
The Group’s medium and long-term debt is fixed rate and largely comprises OCEANE bonds.
At December 31, 2006, the net amount scheduled for refinancing in under a year was 389 million
euros for Nexans and its subsidiaries including the sale of receivables. If interest rates were to vary by
1% the interest expense would therefore vary by 3.9 million euros over a year.

**b)** **Foreign exchange risk**
Nexans hedges its exchange rate risk related to foreseeable contractual trade cash flows and certain
budgeted cash flows. The foreign exchange transactions arising from this hedging may result in
certain positions being kept open. Where this happens, these positions are limited in terms of the
amounts and periods involved. At the balance sheet date, Nexans had no material unhedged foreign
exchange positions.
Exchange rate risk is identified at the level of the Group’s operating subsidiaries. The treasurers of
the subsidiaries hedge the risk by executing forward exchange rate transactions, with Group Treasury
for the centralized subsidiaries, or with their local banks for the other subsidiaries. The table below,
which shows the foreign exchange risk of Nexans’ Central Treasury, includes all forward currency
transactions that had not expired at December 31, 2006. These transactions are carried out on behalf of
the centralized subsidiaries that do all of their hedging internally. These subsidiaries accounted for
87% of Group sales in 2006.

Assets 401 424 101
Liabilities 505 134 509

Hedging (off-balance sheet) 104 (290) 407
Net position after hedging   -   -   _Excluding Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, China, South Korea,_
_Vietnam and Brazil_

Application of the foreign exchange risk procedures is controlled through monthly updates sent to
Central Treasury by all subsidiaries exposed to this risk, reporting in detail on their definite and
estimated flows for each currency and the hedging in place. While the hedging of risks relating to
definite flows eliminates foreign exchange risk, the hedging of risks relating to estimated flows is by
its nature imperfect because the hedged flow may not arise or may differ from the estimated amount.
A program of controls by Central Treasury in the subsidiaries enables regular checks to be carried out
to ensure that the procedures have been properly understood and implemented. Lastly, during its visits
to the Group’s subsidiaries, internal audit systematically reviews the application of the procedures
relating to the identification and hedging of foreign exchange risks.
Some bids are made in currencies other than that in which the entity operates. The foreign exchange
risk relating to these bids is not systematically hedged, which can give rise to a cost for the Group
should there be a change between the time the bid is made and its acceptance by the customer.


-----

**c)** **Metal price risk**
Although copper and aluminum prices are particularly volatile, Nexans believes that its operating
margin is only slightly exposed to these changes in prices, due to the dual effect of passing on any rise
in non-ferrous metal prices to customers and the implementation of forward hedges on the regulated
metals markets.
To offset the risks stemming from the volatility of non-ferrous metal prices (copper and aluminum),
Nexans firstly passes on the metal prices on the day of the order in its pricing and secondly carries out
an actual hedge at the same price or via hedges on the LME: with regard to this twin mechanism,
Nexans does not make any income of a speculative nature on metals, which is what the operating
margin measures, a sign of the cash flow neutrality of this hedging mechanism.
In order for the mechanism to work properly, the units must thus have a permanent metal inventory –
its own inventory referred to as core exposure. This core exposure represents the minimum amounts
that are necessary for the production units to operate appropriately and is not intended to be sold off.
As a result, it is not hedged. The decision to reclassify this non-current asset recognized at historic cost
in inventory and recognize it at its weighted average cost (see Note 1.b) means that the value of the
core exposure will now be exposed to fluctuations in copper and aluminum prices. This accounting
and non-cash impact is recorded below operating margin. The net impact on operating income will be
limited given the presence of the “natural” hedging mechanism via impairment, in line with the
mechanism described in Note 1.b.
Nexans’ margins may be exposed to changes in copper prices in some product lines, such as copper
cables for cabling systems and building market products. In these markets, any increases are generally
passed on in the selling price, but with a time lag that can place a certain amount of pressure on margins.
The keen competition in these markets can also affect the timescale within which the increase is passed
on. As with foreign exchange risk, the risk of fluctuations in copper and other metal prices is not
systematically hedged when making bids.
However, fluctuations in copper and aluminum prices have a significant impact in terms of
financing needs, since a rise in copper prices implies an increase in working capital requirement.
Prices have fluctuated significantly over the past five years. In 2006, copper prices increased very
sharply over the first few months of the year, rising from USD 4,537 at the start of January to USD
8,788, a historic high, on May 12, representing an increase of over 93% in less than five months. In the
second half of the year, copper prices fell, ending the year at USD 6,290, representing an increase of
some 39% over the full year. In euro terms, the rise was limited to 25% over the year when account is
taken of the fall in the dollar against the euro between the start and end of the year, but from January
to May the increase in euro terms nevertheless amounted to 78%.
This increase generated an additional financing need of some 270 million euros for the Group.
Finally, despite its stringent criteria for selecting partners with which it works on the LME, and the
prudential rules to which these partners are subject, Nexans may be exposed to counterparty risk in
the context of forward contracts entered into on the LME.

**d)** **Sensitivity analysis for 2006**
Impact of a 50 basis point rise in interest rates (excluding spread) on the Group’s annual
financial expenses:

Rate assumptions Average debt Impact of a 50 basis
(3 month variable) assumption as to point delta on the
(in millions of Group’s financial
currency of euros) expenses

(in millions of euros)
Euro 3.77% 500 2.5
US dollar 4.90% 140 0.7


-----

Impact of a 100 euro rise in copper prices on the Group’s annual financial expenses:
Average copper price in 2006 (in euros per metric ton) 5,335
Copper content of trade receivables in the Group’s balance sheet (in
metric tons): 120,000
Financing cost in euros (annual interest rate) 3.80%
Impact on financial expenses (in millions of euros) 0.5

Nexans’ hedging policy limits this impact to trade receivables.

**e)** **Credit risk**
Counterparty financial risk stems from foreign exchange hedges entered into and hedging transactions
in the metal markets.

**Foreign exchange derivatives**
For all centralized subsidiaries, foreign exchange transactions are carried out with the Central Treasury
and Metals Department, which in turn hedges its positions with banks. In order to keep counterparty
risk as low as possible, Nexans only authorizes such transactions with banks that have medium to
long-term ratings in excess or equal to Standard and Poor’s AA– and Moody’s Aa3. For subsidiaries
that are not centralized, the same criteria apply but exceptions may be made for subsidiaries located in
countries with ratings under the specified threshold. In this case, the subsidiaries must carry out
transactions involving a counterparty risk with agencies or subsidiaries of banking groups whose
parent company satisfies the above risk criteria.

At December 31, 2006, all unexpired currency forward transactions handled by the Central Treasury
and Metals Department represented a notional amount of 592 million euros on the buy side and
1,122 million euros on the sell side.
Of the 592 million euro unexpired buy side transactions, 524 million will expire in under a year and
the remaining 68 million between one and five years. Of the 1,122 million euro unexpired sell side
transactions, 897 million will expire in under a year and the remaining 225 million between one and
five years. There are no buy or sell side transactions that expire in over five years.

**Metal derivatives**
Non-ferrous metal hedging transactions give rise to a counterparty risk when they are carried out on
the commodity exchanges. Nexans is active on the LME, COMEX and to a small extent on SHFE and
trades in these organized markets to hedge its copper, aluminum and lead risks. Substantially all of the
transactions are standard buy and sell trades.
85% of copper contracts expire in under a year, 13% between one and two years and 2% in over two
years. 84% of aluminum contracts are for less than one year and all lead contracts expire in under a
year.
At December 31, 2006, the Group had long positions in these metals corresponding to 32,259 metric
tons of copper, 4,725 metric tons of aluminum and 8,575 metric tons of lead. Their sale on the market
would generate income of 9.1 million euros for copper, 0.3 million euros for aluminum and 2.6 million
euros for lead.

There are a certain number of contingencies and disputes arising from the Group’s business that
Management believes will not have a material impact on the Group’s income beyond the related
provisions recorded, given the Group’s insurance coverage, and based on an assessment of the
probability of judgment being entered against Nexans and the amount of the claims.

**Disputes giving rise to the recording of provisions**
The most significant ongoing disputes that have given rise to the recording of provisions relate to
corvettes for South Africa. Nexans supplied cables for corvettes for the South African navy. Part of the

supplies were subcontracted to a South African manufacturer. After installation of the cables on the
first two corvettes, it was found that the cables supplied by the subcontractor were noncompliant. All
the cables already installed were removed and replaced. Total damages claimed by the client now
amount to approximately 36 million euros, which has been contested by Nexans. The allocation of
damages amongst Nexans and the parties involved (in particular the clients, the insurers and the
subcontractor) has not yet been determined. In addition to the 5 million euro charge already recorded
for this case in the 2003 financial statements, and in view of the general uncertainty as to the liability
of each party, Nexans considered it was prudent and reasonable to increase the provision in its
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2004, and this remains unchanged.

**Contingent liabilities relating to disputes and proceedings**
The following disputes and other contingencies have not given rise to provisions, because the
recognition criteria were not satisfied.

- A claim filed in Norway in March 2005 against Nexans Norway by one of its competitors – Kvaerner
– alleging infringement of a patent involving umbilical cables. Kvaerner is seeking NOK 310 million
(around 39 million euros) in damages. Nexans is contesting the application of the patent to its products
and manufacturing processes and has itself launched proceedings in Norway and the Netherlands to
invalidate Kvaerner’s patent.

- Certain proceedings launched by the competition authorities. In France, the Direction Nationale des
Enquêtes (National Investigation Agency) of the Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la
Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (Department of competition, consumer affairs and
anti-fraud) started investigations in 2003 and in 2006 into contracts awarded by EDF for the
supply of high-voltage cables, and the electrical cables sector.
No official notification of complaint has yet been received in these two matters and no provision
has been recorded by the Group. However, in view of the limited information available regarding
this investigation, Nexans is unable to predict how they may evolve or what impact they may have
on its results or operations.
In addition, the Bundeskartellamt (German Federal Antitrust Authority) informed Nexans that an
investigation it had opened in 2003 regarding practices in the cable industry in Germany had been
discontinued.

- An issue relating to the cables manufactured by one of the Group’s European subsidiaries and sold to
a harness manufacturer. This manufacturer sold them to another equipment manufacturer, which in
turn sold them to a European vehicle manufacturer. The subsidiary was not informed of the
specifications required by the end customer. The end customer used the cables together with switches
notably for use in wipers and a certain number of cables broke. The subsidiary considers that the
cables sold met the specifications agreed with its customer, the harness manufacturer. At this stage, the
Company has very little information on any problems noted in vehicles on the road or their causes. Its
direct client has formally indicated to the subsidiary that it reserves the right to call upon it to join as a
third party should it be called upon by its own customer, the equipment manufacturer, without having
at the same time set out what the subsidiary’s grounds for liability would be. No legal proceedings
have yet been taken. The vehicle manufacturer nevertheless undertook a recall that could affect around
350,000 switches installed to replace the faulty parts.
Although it is not yet possible to ascertain the impact of these contingencies and disputes, Nexans
currently does not consider that they will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position.
It is, however, not in a position to guarantee this.

To the best of the Company’s knowledge, there are no other Government, court or arbitration
proceedings that Management considers may have a material impact on the Group’s financial position
or profitability.

**Contingent liabilities relating to contractual guarantees**
Group companies have made commitments to banks and other third parties, in particular financial
institutions, who have issued guarantees or performance bonds in favor of customers and guarantees to
secure advances received from customers (330 million euros, 346 million euros and 259 million euros at
December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 respectively). Generally speaking, Group companies give


-----

customers guarantees relating to the quality of the products sold, as well as sellers’ warranties given to
purchasers of businesses that are sold, without taking out bank guarantees or bonds. In the event that it
seems likely that Nexans will be liable for such guarantees, due to issues such as delivery delays or
disputes arising from the performance of a contract, the estimated risk is provided for (see Note 21).

**Note 30** Events after the balance sheet date

In January 2007, Nexans signed two agreements with the US Group Superior Essex to dispose of its
winding wires businesses in Canada and China for 32 million euros. These agreements relate to the
Simcoe site in Canada and Nexans’ 80% majority interest in Nexans Tianjin Magnet Wires and Cables
in China.
At December 31, 2006, these businesses employed 154 people in Canada (Simcoe) and 176 in China
(Tianjin). In 2006, they generated sales of 69 million euros at constant copper prices.
These agreements are subject to the approval of the Chinese and Canadian authorities, as well as the
agreement of the Chinese joint shareholder in Tianjin. The transaction should be completed in the
second quarter of 2007.

**(Year ended December 31, 2006)**

_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in the French language_
_and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The statutory auditors’ report_
_includes information specifically required by French law in all audit reports, whether qualified or_
_not, and this is presented below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements. This information_
_includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant_
_accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an_
_audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate_
_assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated_
_financial statements._
_This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and_
_professional auditing standards applicable in France._

**Nexans**

75008 Paris

To the Shareholders,

Following our appointment as Statutory Auditors by your General Meetings, we have audited the
accompanying consolidated financial statements of Nexans for the year ended December 31, 2006.
These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

_1. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements_
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities,
financial position and results of the consolidated group of companies for the year then ended, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Without qualifying our opinion expressed above, we draw your attention to Section b, “Change
relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories” of Note 1, “Summary of significant
accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the Company’s change
in accounting for core exposure and its impact on consolidated equity and net income.

162


-----

_2. Justification of our assessments_
In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring your attention to the following_
matters:
_Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories_
As part of our assessment of the Company’s accounting methods, we verified that this change is
justified.

_Impairment of assets_
During the last quarter of each year, your Company tests goodwill for impairment and also performs a
review to determine if there is any indication that non-current assets may be impaired, as described in
Section o, “Impairment tests” of Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies” to the
consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed the methods used to carry out these impairment
tests as well as the corresponding cash flow forecasts and assumptions, and we verified that Notes 1.o
and 11 to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate information.

_Deferred tax assets_
Your Company recognizes deferred tax assets in its consolidated balance sheet on the basis of
business plans, as described in Section w, “Deferred tax,” of Note 1, “Summary of significant
accounting policies” and Note 9, “Income tax” to the consolidated financial statements. We assessed
the information and assumptions upon which those estimates were based, reviewed the calculations
made by the Company and compared the accounting estimates for previous periods with actual figures
to ensure that the estimates were consistent with those for the previous period and with those used to
test for asset impairment. As part of our assessment, we ensured that those estimates were reasonable.
The assessments were made in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of
this report.

_3. Specific verification_
In accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information
provided in the Group’s management report.
We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated
financial statements.

**NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

The notes below relate to the balance sheet at December 31, 2006, prior to the appropriation of
income, as well as to the income statement for the year then ended.

The financial year ran for 12 months from January 1 to December 31, 2006. The balance sheet total
was 2,233,617,000 euros and net income amounted to 88,095,000 euros.

The following tables are in euro thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand. As a result, the totals in
the various tables may contain minor differences.

**Note 1: Significant events**

The following significant events took place during 2006:

- The conversion of convertible bonds issued in July 2004 which resulted in the issue of
3,534,160 new shares, each with a par value of 1 euro, with an aggregate issue premium of
129,190,000 euros (see Note 12).

- A further issue, on July 7, 2006, of OCEANE bonds convertible and/or exchangeable for new or
existing shares for an aggregate nominal value of 280 million euros. The debt comprises
3,794,037 bonds, each with a nominal value of 73.80 euros, bearing interest at 1.50% and redeemable
at a price of 85.7556 euros on January 1, 2013.

- An employee share issue approved by the Board of Directors on November 23, 2005 which
resulted in the issue of 65,797 new shares.

- The issue of 378,875 new shares on the exercise of stock options.

- The cancellation – following the decision of the Board of Directors on March 29, 2006 – of all the
2,221,199 treasury shares recorded in the balance sheet at December 31, 2005.

- The impairment of investments in subsidiaries and associates in the amount of 45,181,000 euros.

- The receipt of dividends from subsidiaries (135,416,000 euros), primarily from Nexans
Participations (132,585,000 euros).

- The syndicated credit facility was adjusted in October 2006. It was raised from 450 million euros
to 580 million euros, and its expiry date was extended to October 17, 2011.

**Note 2: Summary of significant accounting policies**

The balance sheet at December 31, 2006 and the income statement for the year then ended have been
prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the principles of prudence and segregation of
accounting periods. Accounting policies have been applied consistently from one year to the next.

Accounting entries are based on the historical cost method.

**2.1.** **Subsidiaries and associates, loans and other long-term securities**
The gross value of these items is stated at their acquisition cost (excluding incidental expenses) or at
their transfer value. A provision for impairment in value is booked when the carrying value exceeds
the fair value.

171


-----

Fair value is determined on the basis of value in use, which is calculated using the multi-criteria
approach that takes into account revalued net assets as well as yield.

Treasury shares purchased as part of a share buyback program, as authorized by the General
Shareholders’ Meeting, are recorded in “Other financial assets”, as there is no intention of use
specified by the Board of Directors.

**2.2.** **Marketable securities**
Marketable securities are stated at the lower of cost or market value. A provision is recorded when
their carrying value exceeds their fair value.

**2.3.** **Receivables**
Receivables are stated at nominal value. A provision for impairment losses is recorded when it is
doubtful that the receivable will be collected.

**2.4.** **Foreign currency receivables and payables**
In accordance with the principle of prudence, a provision is recorded to cover any unrealized foreign
exchange losses relating to the year-end conversion into euros of foreign currency receivables and
payables not covered by a guarantee or a currency hedge. Unrealized gains have no impact on the
income statement.

**2.5. Cash at bank and in hand, borrowings and other debt**
Within the framework of Nexans Group centralized Treasury management:
- Loans and centralized Treasury current accounts in debit relating to Nexans’ direct subsidiaries are
included in “Loans to subsidiaries”.
- Centralized Treasury current accounts at over 3 months relating to Nexans’ indirect subsidiaries
are included in “Other receivables”.
- Very short-term loans and centralized Treasury current accounts in debit (under 3 months) relating
to Nexans’ indirect subsidiaries are included in “Cash at bank and in hand”.
- Borrowings and centralized Treasury current accounts in credit are included in “Other
borrowings”.

At the year-end, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that have not been hedged are
converted at the year-end exchange rate. Any ensuing foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded
as financial income or expense.

**2.6. Regulated provisions**
The Company records all the provisions authorized under tax legislation. The provisions are reversed
in the legally prescribed manner and timeframes.

**2.7.** **Provisions for contingencies and charges**
Provisions are recognized when Nexans has a present obligation (legal or constructive) resulting from a
past event, where it is likely that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be
necessary to settle the obligation and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably measured.

**2.8. Bonds with a redemption premium**
Bonds with redemption premiums are recognized as a liability in the balance sheet at their gross value,
including the premium.

The redemption premium is recognized as an asset and is amortized pro rata to the term of the bond.

**Notes to the balance sheet**
**Note 3: Intangible assets**

No intangible assets were recorded in the balance sheet at December 31, 2006.

172


-----

**Note 4: Property, plant and equipment**

At December 31, 2006, property, plant and equipment comprised non-depreciable miscellaneous
fixtures in the amount of 6,000 euros.

In the first half of 2006, the Company’s liquidity requirements were primarily met through the issue of
commercial paper in the French market and the proceeds of the July 2004 135 million euros bond
issue. In June 2006, 3,534,160 of these bonds were converted into shares and the remaining
18,472 bonds were redeemed (see Note 9).

In July 2006, Nexans carried out a new convertible bond issue for 280 million euros, comprised of
3,794,037 bonds, each with a nominal value of 73.80 euros, bearing interest of 1.50%. The redemption
premium on these bonds amounts to 11.9556 euros per bond.
The bonds may be converted into new shares or exchanged for existing shares at any time up to the
seventh business day prior to the redemption date, namely in principle, December 23, 2012, on the
basis of one Nexans share per bond.
In the second half, Nexans also had recourse to unconfirmed credit lines and partially drew down its
medium-term confirmed credit facility. At December 31, 2006, Nexans had confirmed medium-term
credit lines of 580 million euros, 330 million euros of which had been drawn down.
These credit lines are subject to the customary loan covenants (negative surety, pari-passu and cross
default) and to covenants in respect of financial ratios (consolidated net debt/EBITDA < 2.95, and
consolidated net debt/total equity < 1.15). Nexans was in full compliance with these ratios both at
December 31, 2006, and at the date the Board of Directors approved the financial statements.

A breach of any of these covenants would freeze any undrawn lines and bring forward the due date
of any amounts outstanding, either immediately or after a period of thirty days depending on the
nature of the covenant.

Outstanding commercial paper amounted to 43 million euros at December 31, 2006.

In late 2001, Nexans signed a tax consolidation agreement with its French subsidiaries in
which it directly or indirectly holds an interest of more than 95%. This agreement, which
became effective on January 1, 2002, was signed pursuant to the option made by Nexans to
adopt a French tax consolidation group in accordance with article 223 A et seq. of the French
General Tax Code.
The option is renewable every five years and the latest expiry date was December 31, 2006. For
every taxation period, the contribution of each subsidiary to the corporate income tax payable on
the consolidated net income of the tax group corresponds to the corporate income tax and other
contributions for which each subsidiary would have been liable if it had been taxed on a stand

**STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS**

**(Year ended December 31, 2006)**

_This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in the French language_
_and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. The statutory auditors’ report_
_includes information specifically required by French law in all audit reports, whether qualified or not,_
_and this is presented below the opinion on the financial statements. This information includes an_
_explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and_
_auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on_
_the financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account_
_captions or on information taken outside of the financial statements._
_This report, together with the statutory auditors’ report addressing financial and accounting_
_information in the President’s report on internal control, should be read in conjunction with, and_

**Nexans**
16, rue de Monceau
75008 Paris

To the Shareholders,

In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your General Meetings, we hereby report to you,
for the year ended December 31, 2006, on:

- the audit of the accompanying financial statements of Nexans,

- the justification of our assessments,

- the specific verifications and information required by law.
These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

_1. Opinion on the financial statements_
We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and results of the Company for the year then ended, in accordance with the accounting rules
and principles applicable in France.

_2. Justification of our assessments_
In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de
_commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring your attention to the following_
matters:

186


-----

Your Company records a provision for impairment of its investments and loans granted to subsidiaries
when their carrying amount, estimated on the basis of their value in use, is lower than their gross
value, as described in Note 2.1 to the financial statements.
Our work consisted of assessing the data and assumptions on which those estimates were based,
reviewing the calculations made by the Company, and reviewing the management’s process for
approving those estimates.
As part of our assessment, we also ensured that those estimates were reasonable.
The assessments were made in the context of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole and
therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

_3. Specific verifications and information_
We have also performed the specific verifications required by law in accordance with professional
standards applicable in France.
We have no matters to report regarding:

- the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information
provided in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the documents addressed to the
shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements.

- the fair presentation of the information provided in the management report in respect of
remuneration granted to company officers and any other commitments made in their favor in
connection with, or subsequent to, their appointment, termination or change in function.
In accordance with the law, we have verified that the management report contains the appropriate
disclosures as regards the identity of the principal shareholders.

**OTHER LEGAL INFORMATION**

**Disputes**

A certain number of contingencies and disputes exist in relation to the Group’s business but in view of
the provisions already recognized and the insurance coverage in place, as well as the likelihood of
judgment being entered against Nexans and the amount of the claims concerned, Management believes
that they will not have a significant impact on the Group’s earnings.

The most significant ongoing dispute for which provisions have been recorded relates to cables
supplied by Nexans for corvettes for the South African navy. The supply of certain of these cables was
subcontracted to a South African manufacturer. After installation of the cables on the first two
corvettes, it was found that the cables supplied by the subcontractor were non-compliant. All the
cables already installed were then removed and replaced. The customer is claiming damages of
approximately 36 million euros, which Nexans is contesting. The allocation of liability between
Nexans and the parties involved – including the customer, the insurers and the subcontractor – has not
yet been determined.

In view of the general uncertainty as to the liability of each party, in its 2004 financial statements
Nexans considered it to be prudent and reasonable to increase the €5 million euro provision already set
aside at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2006 this provision was maintained in the Group’s
financial statements. Based on the information available to date and the position of the insurer, the
11 million euro provision currently recorded will probably prove to be unnecessary.

No provision has been recognized for the following additional contingences and disputes because the
circumstances do not meet the recognition criteria:

A claim filed in Norway in March 2005 against Nexans Norway by one of its competitors – Kvaerner
– alleging infringement of a patent involving umbilical cables. Kvaerner is claiming NOK 310 million
(i.e., approximately 39 million euros) in damages. Nexans believes that the patent is not applicable to
its products and manufacturing processes, and has itself started proceedings in Norway and the
Netherlands to invalidate Kvaerner’s patent.

Proceeding launched by the competition authorities. In France, the Direction Nationale des Enquêtes
(National Investigation Agency) of the Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et
de la Répression des Fraudes (Department of Competition, Consumer Affairs and Repression of
Fraud) started investigations in 2003 and 2006 into contracts awarded by EDF for the supply of highvoltage cables, and into the electric cables sector. Nexans received a statement of complaints following
the 2003 investigation, but no indication was given of the fines which could be applied for the alleged
wrongdoings. Nexans intends to vigorously contest these complaints.

In Germany, the investigation started in 2003 by the Bundeskartellamt (German Competition
Authority) into practices in the cable industry has been officially discontinued.

A dispute that arose in 2006 concerning cables made by one of Nexans’ European subsidiaries and
sold to a cable harness maker, which then sold them to an automobile equipment manufacturer
supplying a European vehicle manufacturer (the “end customer”). Nexans’ subsidiary was not
informed of the end customer’s technical specifications. The end customer used Nexans’ cables along
with switches in its windshield-wipers systems, and some of the cables apparently broke. The
subsidiary asserts that the cables were sold according to the specifications given by its customer, the
harness maker. At this stage, Nexans has very limited information regarding the problems observed in
cars that have been sold, or their causes. Nexans’ direct customer has notified the subsidiary that it
reserves the right to join the subsidiary as a third party to the case if a claim is made against it by its
customer, the automobile equipment manufacturer, but has not specified on what basis Nexans’
subsidiary could be held liable. No legal action has been taken to date, although the vehicle


-----

manufacturer has launched a recall that could involve changing faulty parts in approximately 350,000
switches.

Although it is not yet possible to ascertain the impact of these contingencies and disputes, Nexans
currently does not believe that they will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial
position, but it is unable to guarantee this.

The Group is not aware of any other government, legal, or arbitration proceedings that Management
considers may have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position or profitability.

**Trend information/significant change in the Group’s financial or trading position**

In addition to the seasonal nature of the Group’s business, its considerable sensitivity to fluctuations in
non-ferrous metals prices, the signature in late January 2007 of two agreements relating to the sale of
its winding wires business in Canada and China to the US-based group Superior Essex, the way in
which pending procedures may evolve and a price adjustment currently being valued payable by
Nexans in relation to the acquisition of Olex due to an increase in its net assets, Nexans is not aware of
any significant change in the Group’s financial or trading position that has occurred since December
31, 2006. The price adjustment that will be payable in respect of Olex will not exceed 10% of the
enterprise value of this company.

**Material contracts**

In the two years immediately preceding the publication of this Prospectus, Nexans entered into two
agreements that are outside its normal course of business.

First, in 2005, Nexans executed a major transaction with Superior Essex. Nexans executed an
agreement with Superior Essex in order to create a European joint venture to combine the two Groups’
winding wires and varnish businesses in Europe and in England, respectively. Superior Essex holds a
60% stake in this joint venture, called Essex Nexans, while Nexans holds a 40% stake. The joint
venture was partially financed – in an amount of 11.3 million euros – through a promissory note due in
September 2010 issued by Essex Nexans in favor of Nexans. In addition to this 40% stake, Nexans
also received a cash payment of approximately 35 million euros as consideration for the assets
transferred.

The agreement included an earn-out clause providing that a price supplement would be due to Nexans
from Superior Essex if Essex Nexans’ 2006 EBITDA exceeded a certain pre-defined level. Because
this level was exceeded during the year, Nexans is expecting to receive this price supplement from
Superior Essex.

Superior Essex and Nexans also signed a shareholder agreement according to which Nexans has a put
option entitling it to require Superior Essex to buy its entire stake in Essex Nexans at a price equal to
the net value of its contribution plus 40% of (i) Essex Nexans’ accrued net sales (adjusted for certain
items as stipulated in the shareholder agreement), and (ii) all post-closing contributions to capital less
post-closing distributions. This put option is only exercisable if Essex Nexans’ adjusted EBITDA (as
defined in the shareholder agreement) exceeds 14,000,000 euros in 2008, 2009 or 2010.

The price due in the event the option is exercised will be payable in cash or in Superior Essex shares,
or in a combination thereof, at Superior Essex’s option. Superior Essex has a call option on all of
Nexans’ shares in Essex Nexans which may be exercised at any time as from October 21, 2006. The
price due in the event that this call option is exercised will be payable in cash. From June 30, 2011,
both shareholders may freely dispose of their shares to a third party of their choice, subject to a right
of first refusal by the other shareholder.


-----

In addition, Essex Nexans has executed agreements with Nexans’ subsidiaries for the supply of
wirerods and wires. Under the wirerod contract, Essex Nexans committed to buying a monthly volume
of wirerods at a fixed conversion price, which is adjusted annually, plus the cost of copper. According
to the provisions of this agreement, Nexans is the exclusive supplier of wirerod in France and the
exclusive supplier of a substantial portion of Essex Nexans’ requirements in Germany.

Under the wire contract, Essex Nexans committed to buying a substantial portion of wire requirements
from Nexans’ subsidiaries at a fixed conversion price, which is adjusted annually, plus the cost of
copper. According to the provisions of these agreements, Nexans is the exclusive supplier of wire for
all Essex Nexans’ requirements in France and Germany and 30% of its requirements in Portugal.

These agreements expire on December 31, 2008, and are renewed automatically each year, unless
either of the parties terminate them, giving twelve months’ notice.

Second, Nexans signed an agreement with Viscas Corporation in Japan in order to form a joint venture
for manufacturing high-voltage cables. Cables made by the new company, named Nippon HighVoltage Cable Corporation, or NVC, will be sold only to its direct or indirect shareholders. NVC will
not sell to other parties nor carry out any other commercial activities.

NVC is 66%-owned by Nexans Participations and 34% by Viscas. NVC purchased the equipment and
machines necessary for its operations from Viscas, and is leasing its plant from Viscas.

Neither party may sell its shares in NVC without prior approval from the other party.

However, under certain circumstances, Viscas will be entitled, or even required, to sell all its NVC
shares to Nexans at a price corresponding to the shares’ percentage of NVC’s net asset value. These
circumstances include a refusal by Viscas to provide additional financing to NVC in a cumulative
amount exceeding 3,420 million yen; failure to comply with an essential clause of the agreement; and
expiration of the agreement.

Nexans is not aware of any other contract (other than the contracts entered into in the normal course of
business) executed by any member of the Group that include provisions imposing upon any member
of the Group a significant obligation or commitment for the entire Group.

**Relations with Alcatel**

Prior to Nexans’ stock-exchange listing in June 2001, Nexans and its subsidiaries formed part of the
Alcatel group. On March 16, 2005, Alcatel sold its remaining stake in Nexans’ capital.

In addition to the industrial and trade relations now existing between the two groups (non-material as a
percentage of Nexans’ total business), two items are particularly noteworthy:

Following the incorporation of the Nexans Group, under an agreement dated December 1, 2000,
Alcatel granted Nexans a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, with the possibility of granting sublicenses, to use the patents on the cables related to Alcatel’s business which were required for Nexans
to operate its business. Under this agreement, Alcatel also granted Nexans a non-exclusive, royaltyfree license, without the possibility of granting sub-licenses, to use monomode optical fiber patents
related only to manufactured products and manufacturing processes used by Nexans prior to January
1, 2001 at certain of its designated sites remaining within Nexans’ scope of consolidation but
pertaining to Alcatel’s business. Conversely, Nexans granted Alcatel similar rights to Nexans patents.
The parties are not responsible for either guaranteeing the validity or the extent of the rights granted
under license, or for protecting the rights covered by the patents in the event of violation or
infringement by a third party. This agreement was executed for a term equivalent to the term of the
protection of the rights covered by the agreement.


-----

In the context of the incorporation of the Nexans Group, Nexans and certain of its subsidiaries in
Germany, Spain, and Canada, decided to spin-off and subsequently transfer to Alcatel businesses
related to Alcatel’s activities. Conversely, in France and the United States, Alcatel and certain
subsidiaries spun off then transferred to Nexans certain businesses related to Nexans’ activities.
Alcatel and Nexans then agreed to hold each other harmless from any liabilities arising at their
subsidiaries in connection with any business they no longer own. Certain of these obligations expired
before 2006 while others remained in force during the year.

**Capital expenditure**

Nexans’ gross capital expenditure over the last three years was as follows: 96 million euros in 2004,
129 million euros in 2005, and 171 million euros in 2006. These amounts broke down as follows:

By business segment: Energy (80%), Telecom (10%), Electrical wires (8%) and Other (2%),

By geographical area: Europe (66%), North America (14%), Asia-Pacific (3%), Rest of the World
(17%).

2006 was marked by a significant increase in capital spending related to major projects started in
2005:

In Europe, investments were focused primarily on growing business in the priority segments outlined
in the company’s strategic plan. These investments included capacity increases for high-voltage cable
manufacturing, as well as enhanced production and technical facilities in the automotive sector.
Nexans also pursued its efforts to cut costs and boost manufacturing productivity, particularly to meet
the robust demand for medium-voltage cables.

In North America, investments were made to complete the capacity expansion project for US building
cables. Nexans also continued to update the technology of its aeronautical cable manufacturing
equipment, and increase its capacity for high-end LAN cable production.

In Asia, investments centered around the LAN production capacity increase in China and making
further progress on the 2005 automobile cable project in Korea.

In the Rest of the World, the automobile cable development project continued in Morocco while power
cable production capacity was increased at the Lorena site in Brazil. Substantial investments were also
made in Egypt, to improve manufacturing efficiency, and at the Tuzla plant in Turkey, to shift
production towards LAN cables and instrumentation cables for the oil sector.

In order to support its expansion into high-growth markets, Nexans formed a joint venture (in which it
has a 66% stake) to acquire a new plant in Japan for producing high-voltage subsea cables.

Furthermore, the Group’s regional and business reorganization will require considerable resources,
particularly in terms of capital expenditure. These investments are expected to exceed 500 million
euros over the 2007-2009 period, with over 80% allocated to the three priority segments of energy
infrastructure, buildings, and industry.

**Property, plant, and equipment[(20)]**

The Group’s plants and facilities are located in 65 countries around the world, and they represent a
wide range of sizes and types of business. None of the Group’s items of property, plant and equipment
individually represent a material amount for the Group as a whole (i.e., worth an amount exceeding
5% of the Group’s total gross property, plant, and equipment).

**SHAREHOLDERS’ RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS**

**Shareholders’ Meetings (Article 20 of the articles of incorporation)**

Shareholders’ Meetings are convened and vote in accordance with the provisions set forth by law.
When the required quorum is present, the Shareholders’ Meeting represents all the shareholders.
Its resolutions are binding on all, including absent or dissenting shareholders.

If the Board of Directors so resolves, any shareholder may vote at the Meeting using remote
transmission methods (Internet) provided they can provide proof of identity, in accordance with the
terms and methods set forth by law.

At its March 27, 2007 meeting, the Board of Directors requested that a Shareholders’ Meeting to be
held on May 10, 2007 (on second call) approve an amendment to Article 20 of the Company’s articles
of incorporation, entitled “Shareholders’ Meetings,” that would take into account the new regulations
related to methods of participating in Shareholders’ Meetings as set forth in decree n° 2006-1566 of
December 11, 2006, which amends decree n° 67-236 of March 23, 1967, relating to commercial
companies. The new decree has removed the obligation for bearer shareholders to obtain a declaration
from an authorized financial intermediary where their share account is maintained attesting that their
shares have been blocked from being traded for a one day period prior to the Shareholders’ Meeting. A
new provision has been introduced into French law with effect from January 1, 2007, relating to the
“registration date” which applies irrespective of whether or not the articles of incorporation have been
amended. Accordingly the following paragraph will be added to the articles of incorporation:

“The right to participate in, to a postal vote or to be represented at Shareholders’ Meetings is subject to
compliance with the following conditions:

– the shares of owners of shares held in registered form must be registered in the name of the
registered owner in the share accounts held by the Company or by the financial intermediary
appointed by the Company;

– the owners of bearer shares must have obtained a participation declaration in accordance with
applicable law”.

The Board of Directors will also request the Shareholders’ Meeting to approve an addition to
Article 20 of the Company’s articles of incorporation providing that for postal votes of shareholders to
be valid, they must be received at the latest one business day before the Meeting is held (by 15H00
Paris time at the latest), save where applicable law permits a shorter time period, as well as to approve
a further amendment to Article 20 to introduce the new electronic signature authorised by the decree of
December 11, 2006, for those shareholders authorized by the Board of Directors to send their proxy, or
vote, by remote transmission methods (Internet).

**Form of shares and legal disclosure thresholds (Article 7 of the articles of incorporation)**

Shares are registered until they are fully paid up.

Fully paid-up shares may be held in either registered or bearer form, at the shareholder’s discretion. In
addition to the legal obligation of a shareholder to inform the Company when its holdings exceed
certain fractions of the Company’s share capital, any individual or legal entity and/or any existing
shareholder that acquires a number of shares in the Company equal to or greater than 2% of the share
capital or voting rights must notify the Company of the total number of shares held within a period of
fifteen days from the time the threshold is crossed; this notification shall be by registered letter with
return receipt requested.


-----

The same disclosure formalities must be carried out each time a multiple of 2% is reached.

To determine the requisite thresholds, all shares held indirectly shall be taken into account as well as
all the forms of shareholding covered by articles L.233-7 et seq. of the French Commercial Code.

In each notification filed as set forth above, the person making the notification must certify that all
shares held or deemed to be held pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, have been included. He or she
must also provide notification of the acquisition date(s).

In the event of non-compliance with the foregoing provisions and subject to applicable law, the
shareholder shall forfeit the voting rights corresponding to any shares which exceed the thresholds and
which should have been disclosed.

Any shareholder whose stake in the share capital falls below any of the above-mentioned thresholds
must also notify the Company within fifteen days, in the same manner as described above.

Ownership of shares is evidenced by an entry in the shareholder’s name in the share register held by
the issuer or by an accredited intermediary. Transfers of registered shares will be made by transfer
from account to account. All share registrations, payments and transfers shall be made in accordance
with applicable law. Unless exempted by applicable law, the Company may require that the signatures
on disclosures, transaction or payment orders be certified in accordance with prevailing law and
regulations.

The Company may, in accordance with prevailing laws and regulations, require that information
relating to its shareholders or to holders of securities which confer immediate or future voting rights be
communicated to it by any authorized intermediary or organization, including their identity, the
number of securities they hold, and any restrictions on the securities held.

**Voting rights (Article 21 of the articles of incorporation)**

Subject to applicable law and the Company’s articles of incorporation, each Shareholders’ Meeting
attendee shall have a number of votes equal to the number of shares that he or she holds or represents.
Voting rights are exercisable by the beneficial owner at all Ordinary, Extraordinary and Special
General Shareholders’ Meetings.

**Double voting rights (Article 21 of the articles of incorporation)**

Double voting rights are attached to all fully paid-up shares that have been registered in the name of
the same holder for at least two years.

Any registered shares that are converted to bearer shares or whose ownership is transferred
automatically lose their double voting rights. However, registered shares will not lose their double
voting rights, and the above-mentioned two-year qualifying period shall continue to run, following the
transfer from one registered shareholder to another as part of a transfer of shares included in the estate
of a deceased shareholder, or in connection with the settlement of the marital estate or an inter vivos
donation to a spouse or relative in the direct line of succession.

**Limitations on voting rights (Article 21 of the articles of incorporation)**

Regardless of the number of shares held directly and/or indirectly, when voting on resolutions at
Shareholders’ Meetings either in person or by proxy a shareholder with single voting rights may not
exercise a number of voting rights representing more than 8% of the voting rights of all shareholders
present or represented at the meeting concerned. If a shareholder is also entitled to double voting
rights either when voting in person or by proxy, this limit may be exceeded taking into account only


-----

the additional voting rights, but the total voting rights exercised may not represent more than 16% of
the voting rights of all shareholders present or represented. To determine this limitation, all shares held
indirectly shall be taken into account, as well as all the forms of shareholding covered by
articles L.233-7 et seq. of the Commercial Code.

The limitation determined in the foregoing paragraph shall not apply to the Chairman of the Meeting
when voting pursuant to proxies received, in accordance with the legal obligations contained in
article L.225-106 of the Commercial Code.

At its March 27, 2007 meeting, the Board of Directors requested that the next Shareholders’ Meeting
to be held approve an amendment to Article 21 of the Company’s articles of incorporation, relating to
voting rights, to take into account the new regulations related to the exercise of voting rights as set
forth in law n° 2006-387 of March 31, 2006 in the event of takeover bids;

It is therefore proposed that the current text which reads “ The limitation determined in the foregoing
paragraph shall no longer apply when an individual or a legal entity acting alone or in concert holds at
least 66.66% of the total number of shares in the Company, as a result of a takeover bid by way of
purchase or exchange of shares for all the Company’s shares. The Board of Directors shall place on
record that this limitation no longer applies when the results of the takeover procedure are published”
by the new regulations resulting from the law of March 31, 2006: “The restrictions contained in the 4[th]
paragraph of this article are suspended on the holding of the first Shareholders’ Meeting following the
finalization of the takeover bid, if the person making the bid, whether acting alone or in concert, holds
at least 66.66% of the total number of shares or voting rights in the Company”.

**Appropriation of income (Article 23 of the articles of incorporation)**

The difference between revenue and expenses for the financial year, after provisions, constitutes the
net income or loss for the financial year as recorded on the income statement. 5% of the net income,
less any losses brought forward from prior years is transferred to the legal reserve until such time as
the legal reserve represents one tenth of the share capital. Further transfers are made on the same basis
if the legal reserve falls to below one-tenth of share capital, whatever the reason.

Income available for distribution consists of net income for the year, less any losses brought forward
from prior years and any transfer made to the legal reserve as explained above. On the
recommendation of the Board of Directors, the Shareholders' Meeting may appropriate all or part of
said income to retained earnings or to general or special reserves, or decide to distribute all or part of
the amount to shareholders in the form of a dividend.

In addition, the Shareholders’ Meeting may resolve to distribute amounts taken from discretionary
reserves either to create or supplement a dividend or as an exceptional dividend. In this case, the
resolution shall indicate specifically the reserve account from which the distributions are made.
However, dividends will first be paid out of distributable income for the financial year.

The Shareholders’ Meeting may offer shareholders the option of receiving all or part of the final
dividend or any interim dividend in the form of shares instead of cash.

In the event of interim dividends, the Shareholders’ Meeting or the Board of Directors shall determine
the date on which the dividend is to be paid.

**INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY’S CAPITAL AND VOTING RIGHTS**

_resolutions at a Shareholders’Meeting._
_(2) Figures based on declarations of crossing of legal thresholds made to the AMF on March 6, 2007_

In addition to the legal disclosure thresholds crossed as already described in the Board of Directors'
Management Report on page 88 of this Prospectus, Dodge & Cox made a declaration to the AMF on
March 6, 2007 that it had crossed the legal threshold of 10% of voting rights of the Company on
February 28, 2007, increasing the number of shares it holds to 1,866,440 shares representing
3,032,880 voting rights, or 7.35% of the share capital and 11.33% of the voting rights.

To the best of the Company’s knowledge, no shareholder other than those cited in the above table
holds more than 5% of the share capital or voting rights.

Nexans is not aware of the existence of any individual or legal entity that, directly or indirectly, acting
alone or in concert, exercises control over Nexans’ share capital nor of any agreement that if
implemented could subsequently trigger a change in the Company’s control.

**Share equivalents: OCEANE bonds**

On July 15, 2004, Nexans carried out a public issue of 3,552,632 OCEANE bonds convertible into
new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares, for a total value of approximately 135 million
euros. The prospectus for this issue was approved by the AMF on July 6, 2004 under no. 04 652. A
total of 3,534,160 of these OCEANE bonds were converted into new shares, based on Nexans'
decision – as approved by the OCEANE bondholders meeting of May 15, 2006 – to proceed on
June 16, 2006 with the early redemption of all the outstanding 3.125% July 15, 2004 to January 1,
2010 OCEANE bonds.

On July 7, 2006, Nexans carried out a public issue of 3,794,037 OCEANE bonds with a face value per
bond of 73.80 euros, representing a total value of approximately 280 million euros. The prospectus for
this issue was approved by the AMF on June 29, 2006 under no. 06-242. The term of the bonds is
6 years and 178 days. Unless the Company exercises its early redemption option, the bonds will be
redeemed in full on January 1, 2013 at a price of 85.7556 per bond, representing 116% of the total face
value. The bonds carry interest at 1.50% per annum payable in arrears on January 1 each year and their
gross yield-to-maturity is 3.75% (if they are not converted and/or exchanged for shares and if they are
not redeemed in advance). The option to convert or exchange the bonds can be exercised by the
OCEANE bondholders from July 7, 2006 until the 7th business day preceding the scheduled or early
redemption date at the rate of one share per bond (subject to any adjustments required by law). At
March 15, 2007, all the 1.50% July 7, 2006 to January 1, 2013 OCEANE bonds were outstanding.

**Share equivalents: Stock options**

Pursuant to the authorization granted by the Shareholders’ Meeting of May 15, 2006, the Board of
Directors resolved to grant stock options under two new plans in 2006 and 2007, to allow executives
and other managers whose performance has contributed significantly to the Group's development to
share in the Group's increased profitability. Therefore, on November 23, 2006, 343,000 options were
allocated at a unit exercise price of 76.09 euros, and on February 15, 2007, 29,000 options were

allocated at a unit exercise price of 100.94 euros. These options give their holders the right to
subscribe for new Company shares to be issued in connection with a capital increase.
At March 15, 2007, 1,331,200 options to subscribe for Nexans shares, representing 5.24 % of the share
capital, were outstanding. Each option entitles the holder to subscribe for one Nexans share.

**Stock Options Allocation Policy**

In 2004, the Board of Directors drew up an alternating policy for allocating stock options, by means of
which the plan for one year covered the members of the Executive Committee and certain senior
managers, and the plan for the following year covered a different group of employees, particularly
high-potential managers. Each plan represented approximately 1 to 2% of the share capital.

Following a recommendation by the Appointments and Compensation Committee, in 2006 the Board
of Directors decided to abandon this alternating policy for future years and combine these two groups
of people when allocations were made.

### Attached to the Management Report of the Board of Directors on page 66 of this Prospectus is the summary table of the current authorizations in effect granted to the Board of Directors by the Extraordinary General Shareholders' Meeting to increase the share capital, and the use of such authorizations during 2006.
As all these authorizations expire at the next Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors intends
to seek their renewal by submitting to the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on May 10, 2007 (on
second call) several resolutions to grant authorizations to the Board of Directors to issue, with or
without preferential subscription rights, shares and share equivalents. The Board of Directors will
recommend that shareholders once again limit the effective period of these authorizations to one
year (i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting to be called to approve the 2007 financial
statements, except for the authorization to be given in the twentieth resolution which will expire on
the Shareholders' Meeting to be called to approve the 2008 financial statements).


-----

The full text of the proposed resolutions as well as the report by the Board of Directors presenting
them is available on the Nexans website at www.nexans.com.
The table below provides a summary of the conditions and limits contained in the resolutions to be
submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting on May 10, 2007, to allow the Board of Directors, at its
sole discretion and within the framework set by the Shareholders’ Meeting, to issue shares and
share equivalents, with the option of delegating this authorization subject to the terms and
conditions prescribed by law.

**CHAIRMAN’S REPORT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS’**
**OPERATIONS AND THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL**
**PROCEDURES**

**(Year ended December 31, 2006)**

In accordance with article L.225-37 of the Commercial Code, Gérard Hauser, Chairman and CEO of
Nexans, a holding company and parent of the Group, issues this report on the manner in which the
work of the Board is prepared and organized, as well as the internal control procedures implemented
by the Company and any restrictions placed on the powers of the CEO by the Board of Directors. The
report also discusses the rules established by the Board of Directors for setting the compensation and
benefits paid to Nexans corporate officers.

This report concerns the parent company and all Group companies included in the scope of
consolidation.

**1.** **Preparation and organization of the work of the Board of Directors of Nexans, a holding**
**company and parent of the Group**

**1.1.** **Organization of the work of the Board of Directors**

The Board of Directors met eight times in 2006 and more than two-thirds of its members were present
at each of its meetings.

The Chairman and CEO notifies the members of the Board at least one week before each meeting.

Several days before the meeting, the Directors are provided with a file covering the major agenda
items to be discussed and examined.

The Board of Directors is kept informed of the business trends, financial condition and indebtedness
position of the Company and the Group. It approves the parent Company and consolidated financial
statements and Management projections, and reviews the budget. It resolves on matters affecting the
strategy and running of the Company.

All these issues were addressed by the Board during 2006. In particular, the Board renewed Gérard
Hauser’s term as Chairman and CEO until the end of the first half of 2009. In addition, with the
agreement of the Appointments and Compensation Committee, it created a Chief Operating Officer
position and appointed Frédéric Vincent in this capacity. The Board of Directors also decided to carry
out several financial transactions, including the cancellation of treasury shares, a share issue for
Nexans employees, an early call of OCEANE convertible bonds, and a new issue of OCEANE
convertible bonds.

Presentations are made on a regular basis to the Board of Directors by functional department or area
managers to familiarize the Directors with Nexans’ core businesses and provide a clearer picture of the
Group’s internal operations. In the first half of 2006, Board Members visited the Nexans France site in
Lyon, where the Nexans Research Center and the Building business sales force are located. During
this visit, they were given a detailed presentation of the site’s operations and strategy.

Pursuant to its internal rules, the Board was also consulted throughout 2006 on various planned
acquisitions and significant divestitures; it was kept constantly informed of the progress on these


-----

projects. The most significant of these in 2006 was the Olex acquisition in Australia for approximately
310 million euros.

The rules established by the Board of Directors for setting the compensation and benefits paid to
Nexans’ corporate officers are described in the Board of Directors’ Management Report. In 2006, the
Board set the variable portion of the Chairman and CEO’s compensation for 2005, and the procedure
by which it will be calculated for 2006 and 2007. The Board also adopted a new stock option plan, and
outlined the procedure by which the variable compensation for the Chief Operating Officer will be
calculated for 2007.

**1.2.** **Corporate governance: internal rules for the Board of Directors and Director’s Charter**

In 2003, Nexans formally adopted the internal rules for the Board of Directors and a Director’s
Charter.

Nexans complies with and applies the corporate governance principles originating from the Bouton
and Viénot-Bouton reports.

The internal rules and the Director’s Charter are given to each new member of the Board when they
take office.

The internal rules set forth the areas of authority of the Board of Directors, how it operates and the
ethical principles to be followed.

In accordance with the Bouton report, the internal rules determine which capital expenditure or
significant restructuring plans, such as mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or proposed financing
projects will require the prior approval of the Board of Directors, based on their nature and the
amounts involved. The internal rules also define the roles of the various Committees created by the
Board and the criteria for Director independence.

The Director’s Charter sets forth the rights and obligations of Board Members, including the
obligation to disclose transactions carried out in relation to Nexans’ securities, and to comply with
mandatory lock-out periods on any such transactions.

**1.3.** **Appraisal of the Board of Directors**

An annual procedure to appraise the Board of Directors with regard to how it works was implemented
in 2003 to check that material issues are properly reported, dealt with and discussed at its meetings.
This appraisal procedure – which until 2006 was conducted on the basis of a detailed questionnaire
sent to each Director – has revealed a high level of satisfaction with the Board’s operations as well as
some opportunities for improvement.

In 2006, a formal appraisal procedure was performed by Spencer Stuart, which issued the following
statement in its report:
“We held individual meetings with each Board Member, according to a guide developed in
conjunction with the Company. The Board Members unanimously rated the Board’s organization and
operations as extremely satisfactory, due to the quality of the documents provided, the open
discussions at meetings during which Board Members are free to act and speak independently, and an
effective, shared decision-making process. Board Members also expressed their unanimous confidence
in the company’s Executive Committee. Nevertheless, some improvements could be made in terms of
the allocation of work among the Board and its Committees. We would also suggest that Board
Members have more opportunities to meet the broader management team.”


-----

**1.4. Committees formed by the Board of Directors**

- _The Accounts and Audit Committee_

In 2006, the Board of Directors changed the name of the Accounts Committee to the Accounts and
Audit Committee.

**_Composition and role of the Accounts and Audit Committee_**

The Accounts and Audit Committee comprises three members – Messrs. Georges Chodron de Courcel,
Yves Lyon-Caen, and Jean-Louis Vinciguerra, who chairs the Committee. All three were chosen for
their financial and accounting expertise.

The responsibilities of the Accounts and Audit Committee include:
- examining the draft accounts to be submitted to the Board, checking the methods used to
prepare them and ensuring that the accounting principles and methods used are both relevant and
consistent,

- examining the Group’s scope of consolidation,

- ensuring that the Committee is made aware of the internal procedures for identifying offbalance sheet commitments and risks, and checking that such procedures are sufficient to ensure the
reliability of the information resulting from them,
− monitoring sensitive issues,
− examining the work of Internal Audit, giving its opinion and reviewing the main conclusions
of the audits conducted,
− participating in the Auditors selection process and giving its opinion to the Board of Directors
on their appointment or replacement,
− defining the rules for using the Auditor networks for assignments other than auditing, in
accordance with applicable regulations,
− carrying out any specific reviews it deems necessary, after having informed the Chairman and
CEO, and, as appropriate, contacting key executive managers of the Company, and reporting back to
the Board.

In the course of its work, the Accounts and Audit Committee may request to meet with any member of
the Finance Department and the Statutory Auditors, including without the presence of the Group’s
Management.

During 2006, the Accounts and Audit Committee met on five occasions in the presence of the Chief
Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Corporate Vice President, Management Control and
Consolidation, Internal Audit Director and Statutory Auditors. It reviewed Nexans’ consolidated
financial statements, paying special attention to the effects of the transition to IFRS, and examined the
provisions for ongoing litigation. It heard a progress report on the status of the current internal audit
plan as well as the audit plan for 2006-2007, and approved the Company’s proposals concerning the
management of copper hedges. The Accounts and Audit Committee also recommended replacing the
current Statutory Auditors, Barbier Frinault & Autres (Ernst & Young), whose term was due to expire,
by PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit, and approved the creation of a reinsurance captive for the Group.
Finally, the Committee carefully reviewed the change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal
inventories and recommended that it be approved by the Board of Directors.


-----

- _The Appointments and Compensation Committee_

**_Composition and role of the Appointments and Compensation Committee_**

The Appointments and Compensation Committee comprises three members: Messrs. Gianpaolo
Caccini, François Polge de Combret, who was appointed on May 15, 2006 and Ervin Rosenberg, who
chairs the Committee.

The responsibilities of the Appointments and Compensation Committee include:
- examining and making suggestions regarding the assessment of Directors’ independence, prior
to a final decision made by the Board of Directors,

- proposing to the Board new Directors and officers to be co-opted or proposed at the Annual
Shareholders’ Meeting,

- proposing to the Board criteria for determining the fixed and variable portions of corporate
officers’ compensation in line with the Group’s annual performance, executives’ performance
appraisals, the Group’s medium-term strategy and market practices,

- helping define the Group’s policy relating to stock option plans (frequency, individuals
concerned, total amount), which it proposes to the Board of Directors, and gives the Board its opinion
on plan proposals drawn up by Management.

The Appointments and Compensation Committee met three times during 2006. It set the variable
portion of the Chairman and CEO’s compensation for 2005, and the procedure by which it will be
calculated for 2006 and 2007. It also resolved on changes to the Group’s organizational structure, and
supported the Chairman and CEO’s proposal to appoint Frédéric Vincent as the Chief Operating
Officer. The Committee set the procedure for calculating the variable portion of the Chief Operating
Officer’s compensation for 2007, and approved a new stock option plan and the list of option
beneficiaries.

**1.5.** **Restrictions that may be placed on the powers of the Chairman and CEO**

The Board of Directors has decided not to separate the positions of Chairman of the Board of
Directors and CEO. Other than the applicable legal restrictions and those relating to transactions or
decisions that require the prior approval of the Board of Directors as defined in the internal rules –
such as mergers, acquisitions, or financing proposals – neither the Board of Directors, nor the
Company’s bylaws have placed any restrictions on the powers of the Chairman and CEO.

**2.** **Internal control procedures**

**2.1.** **Nexans’ internal control objectives**

Nexans’ internal control procedures consist of implementing a set of rules throughout the Group with a
view to obtaining reasonable assurance that all transactions comply with applicable laws and
regulations and are consistent with the values, policies and objectives defined by the Group.

Nexans takes a pragmatic approach to internal control. Its internal control procedures take into account
the specific aspects of its business and are geared to the risks identified with its activities. Nexans has
designed its internal control procedures in line with the management of its potential risks.

All Nexans Group procedures, whether or not they relate to financial information, have been
established centrally at the level of the parent Company. They are then implemented in each country
and at each entity, and periodic reports are sent to the functional department in charge, which monitors
and controls the procedures.


-----

**2.2.** **General organization and description of the internal control procedures implemented**

**2.2.1. Parties involved and structures in place: organization of the Group in 2006**

In 2006 the Nexans Group was organized as follows:

Countries are responsible for operating income. Their performance continues to be monitored by
market and by product under a full monthly financial reporting procedure.

The countries are grouped into four **areas – Europe, North America, Asia-Pacific, and the Rest of the**
World – which are responsible for managing, coordinating and supervising both operations and the
implementation of the Group’s strategy in accordance with the regulations in effect in each country.

Each area is led by a Regional Manager assisted by a financial control team.

**2.2.2. Changes to the Group’s organizational structure effective from February 1, 2007**

**a)** **Executive Committee**

The Chief Operating Officer is now responsible for overseeing operations in the Europe, North
America, Asia-Pacific, and Rest of World areas. A new Executive Vice President for North America
has been appointed to join the Executive Committee.

**b)** **Strategic Operations Department**

A specific organization for each of the industry, infrastructure, and building markets has been
created within the Strategic Operations Department, in order to better coordinate Nexans’ product
lines. This replaces the Marketing Department.

**c)** **Areas**

An Area Sales Manager has been appointed for each area, who reports directly to the Area
Executive Vice President. The Area Sales Manager is responsible for sales within his or her area,
except for sales of domestic products made locally, as well as inter-area sales. The Area Sales Manager
works with the Infrastructure and Building Market Managers to develop a marketing strategy, and
provides the Industry Market Manager with information needed to develop a marketing strategy for
the relevant segments.

**d)** **Management Council**

A Management Council has been created in order to more closely involve the Group's entities
in its overall management This Council is led jointly by the Chief Operating Officer, Executive Vice
President of Strategic Operations, and Executive Vice President of Europe. It meets at least once per


-----

quarter to review the most pressing issues related to implementing the Group’s strategy. Other people
that may take part in this Council include members of Nexans’ Executive Committee (apart from the
Chairman and CEO), Area Sales Managers, the Industry Market Manager, and certain Country
Managers.

**2.2.3.** **Parties involved and structures dedicated to internal control**

**a)** **The Accounts and Audit Committee**

As a result of the above-mentioned powers conferred upon it by the Board of Directors and the
internal rules, the Accounts and Audit Committee plays a key role in implementing internal control
processes, exercising such control and monitoring the procedures in place.
Each year, the internal audit plan is submitted to the Accounts and Audit Committee for approval, and
the main conclusions from the previous year are also presented to the Committee.

**b)** **The Internal Audit Department**

The Internal Audit Department was created on January 1, 2002, and in July 2005 was one of the first
internal audit departments to be certified by the Institut Français de l’Audit et du Contrôle Internes
(the French Audit and Internal Control Institute) (IFACI). This certification was renewed by the IFACI
in July 2006 after a follow-up audit. Although organizationally it reports to the Finance Department,
functionally the Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Chairman and CEO. Its work is
approved and monitored by the Accounts and Audit Committee.

The Internal Audit Department helps the Group to attain its objectives by systematically and
methodically assessing the suitability of management processes in terms of risks, control, and
corporate governance, monitoring these processes and making recommendations to strengthen them.

The Group has also set up an audit charter – approved by the Accounts and Audit Committee in 2005 –
which sets out the responsibilities of the Internal Audit Department.

The ongoing responsibilities of the Internal Audit Department, covering financial and administrative
as well as operational matters, are as follows:
- identify, analyze and measure risks,
- ensure that internal control mechanisms are in place and functioning, and ensure
compliance with internal control procedures,
- conduct internal financial audits,
- conduct operational audits in cooperation with the departments concerned,
- propose corrective actions and methods of implementation,
- identify and promote best practices.

To achieve these goals, the Internal Audit Department conducts audits to verify that the measures that
have been implemented are appropriate and are effective for the Group’s potential risks.

A risk mapping process was launched in 2002, carried out jointly by the Internal Audit Department
and an external consulting firm. The aim of this process was to identify risks and areas of risk
including all risks identified by management as well as their concerns with respect to controls, and to
evaluate their impact on the Nexans Group’s financial condition and earnings.

The risk map is updated every year, focusing in particular on controlling and monitoring issues
identified as sensitive, as well as following up on recommendations made in the context of internal
audits.

Risks were identified through interviews with Executive Committee members, the Managers of
Corporate Functions, Product Line Managers and Country Managers.


-----

Risks were evaluated according to the frequency with which they are likely to occur and the gravity of
the consequences that may result from the occurrence of the risk. The level of risk was evaluated and
rated before and after application of existing internal control procedures

An audit plan was drawn up on the basis of the risk map, covering a broad spectrum of issues,
including:
- Cash management and exchange rate risks,
- Non-ferrous metal hedging risk,
- Purchasing process,
- Inventories process,
- Sales process,
- Management of major turnkey projects,
- Legal, insurance, safety and environmental issues,
- Information systems,
- Human resources.

The Executive and Accounts and Audit Committees review and update this audit plan annually.

After each audit is conducted, the Internal Audit Department issues a report that contains
recommendations which are subject to a formal monitoring procedure. Each report is sent to the
Chairman and CEO, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the appropriate
member(s) of the Executive Committee, the Head of the Risk Management Department and the entity
audited and relevant functional managers.

In addition, an annual report on the work carried out by the Internal Audit Department is submitted to
the Board of Directors, the Accounts and Audit Committee and the Executive Committee.

During financial year 2006, compliance audits were conducted in certain subsidiaries in France and
abroad. Specific audits were also conducted, particularly in regard to managing copper price and
exchange rate risk in the Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department, capital expenditures and
monitoring restructuring expenses.

**c)** **The Risk Management Department**

The Risk Management Department reports to the Corporate Counsel, who in turn reports to the Chief
Operating Officer. It is charged with monitoring insurance coverage as well as risk management in
general.

The Risk Management Department’s responsibilities are as follows:

- propose a strategy for managing operating, commercial, industrial and financial risks by
seeking the optimum balance between insurance cover, prevention and other measures, and the
acceptance of certain risks,

- take out insurance providing the optimum coverage/cost ratio,

- implement and manage the global insurance program,

- manage the network of brokers and other external consultants,

- set up and coordinate a network of internal insurance specialists within each unit of the
Nexans Group,


-----

- propose and monitor the introduction of measures other than insurance for risk prevention
and management purposes.

In view of the broad scope of these responsibilities close cooperation is required with the functional
departments at the corporate level, operations management at the area level, and the legal entities, in
order to define and implement financially viable solutions in line with the directives defined at the
Group level.

The Risk Management Department also works closely with the Internal Audit Department.

**d)** **The Disclosure Committee**

This Committee, established in October 2003, comprises the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief
Financial Officer, the Head of the Management Control and Consolidation Department, the Corporate
Counsel, the Head of Corporate/Capital markets law, the Internal Audit Director, the Risk Manager,
and three Area Controllers.

The Committee’s objective is to identify all risks of any nature to which the subsidiaries are exposed,
assess their materiality, their due representation in the financial statements and their disclosure in the
various external reports.

Its responsibilities include the following:

- identify and assess any material non-financial information,
- design a survey to be sent to the subsidiaries to identify risks,
- evaluate the methods implemented to submit information to the parent Company,
- compile significant information,
- identify and define issues that merit investigation by the internal audit team in order to
assess or improve the reliability of the procedures in place and the information submitted to the parent
Company.

**2.2.4.** **Specific aspects of internal control procedures relating to financial and accounting**
**information**

**a)** **Main players involved and coordination between them**

**The Corporate Finance Department, which includes six functional departments:**
- The Management Control Department,
- The Consolidation Department,
- The Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department,
- The Internal Audit Department,
- The Tax Department,
- The Financial Operations Department (which includes the M&A Department and the
Financial Communications Department).

All these departments report to the Chief Financial Officer, who in turn reports to the Chief Operating
Officer.

In addition, the Finance departments in each country report to both the Country Manager and
functionally to the Corporate Finance Department.

This structure ensures coordinated, consistent processing of financial information.


-----

**b)** **Key information concerning procedures related to financial and accounting information**

Financial and accounting information is generated in consolidated form as follows:

- **Preparation of financial and accounting information**

All information is obtained from the accounting systems of the legal entities, whose accounts are kept
according to local accounting principles and then restated in accordance with the accounting principles
and methods applied by Nexans to prepare the consolidated financial statements. French GAAP were
applied by Nexans through December 31, 2004, and IFRS have been applied since 2005, pursuant to
EC regulation 1606/2002 (the 2004 financial statements have been restated according to IAS/IFRS to
facilitate year-on-year comparisons).

The breakdown by business segment and product line is based on the legal entities’ financial
statements. These statements are prepared according to standard accounting principles defined in
numerous procedures. In particular, to ensure the consistency of the information produced, Nexans has
an accounting manual which is used by all Group units and defines each line in the operating income
statement analyzed by function for the unit as a whole and for their product lines.

- **The process**

In the final quarter of each year, a budget is prepared by the units for each product line. The budget is
discussed by the Local and Area Management and is submitted to Nexans’ executive management
team for final approval. The Group’s budget is submitted to the Board of Directors. It is then included
in a monthly report.

Each month, the units prepare a report broken down by product line, the results of which are analyzed
by Management as part of the business review. The figures are compared with the budget and with the
previous year’s results. The consolidated results by area and by product line are analyzed by Nexans’
executive management team at an Area meeting.

A consolidated accounts closing procedure is carried out on a quarterly basis, with a specific procedure
applicable at the year-end. This specific year-end procedure involves Balance Sheet Committee
meetings which are attended by Country managers and where key decisions are made relating to the
year-end accounts closing.

Off-balance sheet commitments are reviewed by the Consolidation Department based on information
provided by the units, the Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department and the Legal Department.

- **The procedures**

Over seventy procedures relating to financial and accounting information, and more generally the
areas within the responsibility of the Finance Department, are currently applicable within the Nexans
Group.

In addition to the accounting and financial rules implemented by the Group, these procedures also deal
with sensitive issues or risk factors identified that are specific to Nexans’ business and could have an
impact on its assets or earnings. This is the case, for example, with the management of risks associated
with exchange rates, interest rates and the fluctuation of non-ferrous metal prices that are monitored by
the Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department, which reports regularly to the Corporate Finance
Department.

The Internal Audit Department performs controls to ensure that internal control procedures are
working properly and that they are complied with.


-----

**c)** **Rules specific to the management of risks related to non-ferrous metals**

In view of the importance of non-ferrous metals (copper, aluminum) to Nexans’ various business lines
and the risks associated with price fluctuations, Nexans has implemented a specific procedure for
managing non-ferrous metals, led since January 2004 by a team reporting to the Group Financing
Department.

The basic rules are as follows:

- the principle is the systematic hedging of risks relating to metal prices and structure as
soon as the risk arises,
- this principle is applied by each legal entity for which position limits are set. These limits
are reviewed regularly based on the development of each unit’s business. Monitoring adherence to the
limits is part of Internal Audit’s responsibilities,
- this principle is reflected in the consolidated financial statements by the recording of
outstanding commitments.

Non-ferrous metal price risks are identified by the Group’s operating subsidiaries. They are hedged
through the physical purchase and sale of metal inventory or transactions on commodities exchanges
such as the London Metal Exchange (LME) or the New York Commodities Exchange (COMEX).
Commodities exchange transactions are managed by the Financing Department apart from those
carried out on the Shanghai Metal Exchange (SHFE) which are organized by the Group’s Chinese
subsidiaries.

Trading on these markets is executed through first-rate brokers whose financial soundness is reviewed
regularly to minimize counterparty risks.

**d)** **Centralized Cash Management**

Nexans has implemented a centralized system for its principal subsidiaries to manage cash flow, which
is organized around the following:

- international cash pooling,
- centralized bank commitments,
- centralized foreign exchange risk management.

**2.2.5.** **Information on other internal control procedures**

There are approximately sixty such internal control procedures within the Group covering areas such
as:

- ethics – the Group has established a code of ethics entitled “Nexans Business Ethics and
Conduct,” which specifies certain principles and rules of conduct,

- human resources – a procedure relating to personal safety in at-risk geographic areas has been
implemented,

- communications,

- purchasing,

- information systems,

- quality,

- intellectual property,

- insurance,

- legal issues,


-----

- industrial and environmental issues: a charter has been drawn up relating to the management
of industrial risks covering the protection of property, accident prevention, personal safety, security
and environmental protection. The purposes of this charter are to:
- identify and quantify the risks to which Nexans is exposed,
- define priorities and recommend prevention and control measures to reduce the frequency
and magnitude of such risks,
- organize Nexans’ insurance program accordingly,
- organize crisis management plans.

The implementation of the above is managed by the Industrial Management Department in liaison
with the Finance Department, the Risk Management Department, and the Legal Department for
insurance matters, with extensive interaction between the corporate departments and designated
managers at various levels of the organization.
Nexans’ policies and procedures regarding the environment are described in the Board of Directors’
Management Report.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

Below is a reproduction of the Issuer’s press release issued on 17 April 2007.

**Financial information for 2007 first quarter**

**Nexans achieves a remarkable performance with organic growth**
**of 15% of its cable businesses[21]**
**(excluding electrical wires)**

**Paris, April 17, 2007 - Nexans today announced its 2007 first quarter sales of 1,805 million euros (at**
actual non-ferrous metal prices[22]). At constant non-ferrous metal prices[23], sales were **1,194 million**
euros, reflecting organic growth of 6%. Excluding the electrical wires business where the reduction in
activity has been programmed by the Group, growth was 15.1%.

This strong organic growth of sales was accompanied by a notable increase in operating margin
compared with the first quarter of 2006.

Nexans net financial debt at March 31, 2007 remained stable compared to that recorded at
December 31, 2006 (633 million euros).

**Consolidated sales by business sector**

 - **Energy infrastructures: high level of activity**
Demand for energy infrastructure cables remained very strong. Sales grew over 11% on the
basis of comparable data during the first quarter. This growth was seen mainly in sales of
accessories and high voltage cables.

21 Cables and associated products (accessories), excluding electrical wires.
22 At actual metal prices, first quarter 2006 sales were 1,659 million euros (see Appendix).
23 To neutralize the effect of variations in the purchase price of non-ferrous metals and thus measure the
underlying sales trend, Nexans also calculates its sales using a constant price for copper and aluminum.

- **Industry: strong development of priority sectors**
Up 17.3% on the basis of comparable data, sales of special cables for large industrial equipment
manufacturers accelerated worldwide, with particularly vigorous growth in the Shipbuilding
and Oil & Gas sectors.

- **Building: strong organic growth and high margins**
Sales in the building sector in the first quarter of 2007 continued at the same pace as in the
second half of 2006 with organic growth of 17%. Profit margins continued to improve with
sales volumes substantially the same in Europe as in the last quarter of 2006, and were slightly
better in North America in the stated period.

- **Telecom infrastructures: acceleration of sales**
Telecom sales increased by approximately 22% on the basis of comparable data during the first
quarter of 2007, as a result of positive developments in the niche markets for optical fiber
cables as well as increasing sales in the telecommunications copper cable industry, in particular
in Asia and originating from Spain.

- **Private Network (LAN): further increase in sales**
LAN cable activities recorded growth of 17.6%, following the same trends observed during the
last quarter of 2006 (in terms of price and volumes).

- **Electrical wires**
Since the Group has refocused on its internal requirements, sales of electrical wires have
decreased by 33%. Operating margin has nevertheless improved as a result of commercial
measures taken in respect of external sales and cost reduction measures.

During the first quarter of 2007, sales in the cable businesses in North America only grew by 3.1%,
due to the temporary closure of a production site dedicated to energy networks, which is currently
starting up again.

On the basis of comparable data, cable business sales increased by 16.6% in Europe and by 22.1% in
the Rest of the World area.

(in relation to the annual report submitted March 28, 2007)

Disputes

1. The most significant ongoing dispute for which provisions have been recorded relates to cables
supplied by Nexans for corvettes for the South African navy. The supply of certain of these
cables was subcontracted to a South African manufacturer. After installation of the cables on the
first two corvettes, it was found that the cables supplied by the subcontractor were noncompliant. All the cables already installed were then removed and replaced. The customer has
claimed damages of approximately 36 million euros, which Nexans is contesting. The allocation
of liability between Nexans and the parties involved – including the customer, the insurers and
the subcontractor – has not yet been determined.
In view of the general uncertainty as to the liability of each party, Nexans considered it to be
prudent and reasonable in its 2004 financial statements to increase the 5 million euro provision
already set aside at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2006 this provision was maintained in

the Group’s financial statements. Based on the information available and the position of the
insurer, the 11 million euro provision currently recorded in the accounts will probably prove to
be unnecessary.

2. In the proceedings started by the competition authorities in France, the Direction Nationale des
_Enquêtes (National Investigation Agency) of the_ _Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la_
_Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (Department of Competition, Consumer Affairs_
and Repression of Fraud) started investigations in both 2003 and 2006, into certain contracts
awarded by EDF for the supply of high voltage cables, and the market for electric cables
respectively. Nexans received a statement of complaint from the French Competition Council
("Conseil de la Concurrence") further to the 2003 investigation, but no indication was given of
the fines which may be applied for the alleged wrongdoings. Following receipt of the statement,
Nexans France has agreed with the executive case officer of the French Competition Council on
a settlement procedure. No provision has been recorded for this case as the circumstances do not
meet the required recognition criteria. In light of the specific circumstances of the case, Nexans
believes the outcome of this procedure will not have a significant impact on the Group’s net
financial situation. Finally, the statement of complaint confirms that the 2006 investigation has
been closed.

14. On 3 June 2003, the European Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted the
Directive 2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments
(the "Directive"). The Directive requires Member States as from 1 July 2005 to provide to the
tax authorities of the other relevant Member State, inter alia, details of payments of interest and
other similar income within the meaning of the Directive made by a paying agent within its
jurisdiction to (or under certain circumstances for the benefit of) an individual resident in
another Member State (the “Disclosure of Information Method”).

However, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria, instead of using the Disclosure of Information
Method, impose a withholding system for a transitional period unless the beneficiary of interest
payment elects for the Disclosure of Information Method or for the tax certificate procedure, as
applicable. The rate of such withholding tax equals 15% during the first three years of the
transitional period, 20% during the subsequent three years and 35 % until the end of the
transitional period.

Such transitional period will end at the close of the first full fiscal year following the later of (i)
the date of entry into force of an agreement between the European Community, following a
unanimous decision of the European Council, and the last of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, San
Marino, Monaco and Andorra, providing for the exchange of information upon request as
defined in the OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters released on
18 April 2002 (the “OECD Model Agreement”) with respect to interest payments within the
meaning of the Savings Directive, in addition to the simultaneous application by those same
countries of a withholding tax on such payments at the rate applicable for the corresponding
periods mentioned above and (ii) the date on which the European Council unanimously agrees
that the United States of America is committed to exchange of information upon request as
defined in the OECD Model Agreement with respect to interest payments within the meaning of
the Savings Directive.

A number of non-EU countries and dependent or associated territories have agreed to adopt
similar measures (transitional withholding or exchange of information) with effect since 1 July
2005.

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a
withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that
payment, neither the Issuer nor any Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay


-----

additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding
tax. If a withholding tax is imposed on payment made by a Paying Agent, the Issuer will be
required to maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State that will not be obliged to withhold or
deduct tax pursuant to the Directive.

Each Noteholder shall be responsible for supplying, in a timely manner, any information as may
be required by the latter in order for it to comply with the identification and reporting obligations
imposed on it by the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any European Directive
implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council Meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the
taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to
conform to such Directive.

The Directive has been implemented in French law by Article 242 ter of the French _Code_
_Général des Impôts and Articles 49 I ter to 49 I sexies of the Schedule III to the French_ _Code_
_Général des Impôts. Article 242 ter of the French Code Général des Impôts, imposes on paying_
agents based in France an obligation to report to the French tax authorities certain information
with respect to interest payments made to beneficial owners domiciled in another Member State,
including, among other things, the identity and address of the beneficial owner and a detailed
list of the different categories of interest paid to that beneficial owner.

The Directive has been implemented in Luxembourg law by Act of 21 June 2005.
