For further information in this regard, see the Chairman’s report on the Board of Directors’ Operations and the Company’s Internal Control Procedures on pages 206 to 218 of this Prospectus. The most important risks identified which apply to Nexans’ operations and to the Group are described below.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks related to the seasonal nature of Nexans’ business,13.3.1,,"Nexans’ business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Consequently, income generated during the first six months of the year is generally lower than in the second half of the year. Historically, this difference can largely be explained by the following factors: - a large number of Nexans’ products are linked to the construction of outdoor infrastructure. Orders relating to these products therefore tend to be placed when climatic conditions are more favorable, particularly in the second and third quarters of the year; - customers generally place major orders for delivery during the fourth quarter, at the end of the annual budget year, particularly for public works projects; - Nexans’ working capital requirements increase significantly during the first quarter of each year due to the increase in inventories needed to fulfill orders already placed or expected during the second and third quarters. The increase in working capital requirements during the first and second quarters generally leads to an increase in debt levels and thus financial expenses. During the third and fourth quarters, a decrease in Nexans’ working capital requirements and debt levels is generally observed.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Risks related to contractual liability,13.4.1,,"The nature of Nexans’ business exposes it to claims for product liability and claims for damage to property or third parties allegedly caused by its products. Nexans provides warranties relating to the performance of its products which may cover a considerable period of time. ----- In addition, warranties given to Nexans pursuant to contracts for the supply of the materials and components used in its products may be less extensive than the warranties Nexans gives to its customers, for example, in the optical fiber sector. 9 to 10% of Nexans’ consolidated sales (based on constant non-ferrous metal prices) derive from contracts for the supply and installation of cables as part of turnkey infrastructure projects. These contracts relate primarily to high-voltage landbased and undersea cables. Individual contracts often have a high value and contain penalty and liability clauses in the event Nexans is unable to comply with the delivery schedule or with quality requirements (for example, technical defects requiring intervention after installation due to product non-conformity resulting from production anomalies). If these clauses are invoked, the amount of penalties involved, the size of claims for damages or the financial impact on the project due to delays could have a significant negative impact on Nexans’ financial situation and income. The Group has put in place a stringent product quality control system to limit these risks. A large number of Nexans’ units are ISO 9001 or 9002 certified, as appropriate. Overall quality is a driving force behind the continuous improvement plan that is part of the Group’s Corporate Program + initiative. Methodologies used in Program + are strictly aligned with ISO 9000-2000 certification criteria. Every month, units monitor a set of indicators used to evaluate progress made in terms of quality and customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction surveys are also used throughout the Group. In addition, large contracts are subjected to a systematic risk evaluation procedure. Particular focus is placed on raising the awareness of the Group's sales teams in relation to the risks inherent in sales contracts and on the negotiation of standard contract terms, with the involvement of the Group’s Legal Department. Furthermore, Nexans currently has liability insurance coverage that it considers to be in line with industry standards, but it cannot guarantee this insurance offers sufficient coverage for all of the liability claims filed against the Group (see page 188 of this Prospectus).",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks related to dependence on customers,13.5.1,,"Nexans’ activities are spread across a variety of businesses (energy, telecommunications, electrical wires), and it has many different types of final customer (distributors, equipment manufacturers, industrial operators, public operators) in a wide range of countries. This diversity acts as a safeguard for the Group as a whole and no customer accounts for more than 3% of consolidated sales. Nonetheless, given the level of operating income involved and the difficult market conditions, the loss of one customer, particularly in niche markets such as automobiles, shipbuilding and aerospace, which are more concentrated, could have an impact on Nexans’ income. In addition, the demand for certain products is affected by the economic environment of the related business sector, such as in the oil industry for example.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.6,Risks related to raw materials and supplies,13.6.1,,"Copper, aluminum and plastic are the main raw materials used by Nexans. Therefore, price fluctuations and the availability of products have a direct effect on the Group’s business. Nexans has so far always been able to obtain adequate supplies at reasonable prices. A global copper shortage or interruptions of supplies could have an adverse effect notwithstanding that Nexans has diversified its sources of supply as much as possible in order to reduce these risks. The situation is to some extent similar for petroleum byproducts such as polyethylene, PVC and plasticizers. The inability to source raw materials at reasonable prices could therefore adversely affect Nexans’ business and income. ----- The Group’s policy is always to have at least two suppliers for any raw material or component used in manufacturing its products. There are nonetheless certain isolated cases where the Group uses a sole supplier, particularly for the materials used to make high voltage cables. An increase in raw material, energy or transportation costs could have a significant impact on Nexans’ business or income. As part of its strategic purchasing policy to secure the supply of certain raw materials in terms of both volume and price (i.e., the LME price plus a premium), Nexans – which uses around 800,000 metric tons/year of copper – signed copper cathode purchasing contracts with two suppliers extending until 2009. The annual volume purchased under these contracts is fixed in November of the preceding year, and for 2007 amounted to approximately 400,000 metric tons. The Group has also signed copper cathode purchasing contracts with other suppliers incorporating fixed annual volumes. In addition, the Group uses around 140,000 metric tons/year of aluminum. To secure its supplies of aluminum wirerod and in view of the market for aluminum, the Group has placed firm purchase orders for amounts sufficient to cover its needs in 2007 and given firm purchase commitments for 50,000 metric tons/year for 2008 through 2012. As these products are listed on regulated markets, the Group could sell any quantities that are purchased but not subsequently used, although it may incur a loss related to the bid/offer spread. In addition, in view of the Group’s prominent role in the undersea high-voltage and umbilical cables market, it needs a cable-laying vessel capable of performing the Group’s installation contracts within the timeframes required. As there is a limited market for such vessels, in November 2006, Nexans acquired the cable laying vessel, _Bourbon Skagerrak,_ from Bourbon Cable AS, a Norwegian subsidiary of the French group Bourbon. This vessel – which has been renamed Nexans Skagerrak – is one of the few in the world specially designed to transport and lay umbilical cables and high-voltage subsea cables. Before the acquisition, Nexans had operated this vessel through an exclusive long-term chartering contract.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.7,Geopolitical risks in high-growth areas,13.7.1,,"High-growth countries are one of the Group's avenues for expansion but certain of these areas represent significant geopolitical risks. In 2006, Nexans generated between 2% and 3% of its consolidated sales (at current non-ferrous metal prices) in countries classified by Coface as having a very uncertain economic and political climate or representing a very high risk that could result in a deterioration or aggravation of payment behavior.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.8,Risks related to the Group’s competitive environment,13.8.1,,"The cable industry remains relatively fragmented both regionally and internationally, and the cable, wire and cabling system markets are highly competitive. The number and size of Nexans’ competitors vary depending on the market, the geographical area and product line concerned. Consequently, the Group has several competitors in each of its businesses. Furthermore, for certain businesses and in certain regional markets, Nexans’ main competitors may have a stronger position or have access to greater know-how or resources than Nexans. In recent years, cable makers have had to contend with a global crisis in the telecommunications markets and the steady increase in trade of certain types of low value- added cable among countries in a given region. This has led a number of market players to launch restructuring programs to reduce excess production capacity. Apart from these corrective measures however, there have been no radical changes to the structure of the industry and it remains relatively fragmented both regionally and globally. ----- Conditions have become more favorable for the industry since 2005 and capacity is being better used. New actors are coming onto the scene encouraged by the development of new markets, especially in emerging countries. As certain of its products (cables, wires and accessories) must comply with industry specifications and are interchangeable with the products of its main domestic and international competitors, Nexans faces stiff competition in most of its markets in terms of price, delivery time and service. In the industrial sector, OEM customers (“Original Equipment Manufacturers”) are shifting away from standardized products, meaning that Nexans must be increasingly flexible and develop new solutions so as to accommodate ever more demanding specifications and functionality requirements. The principal competitive factors in the cable industry are cost, service, product quality and availability, geographical coverage and the range of products offered. In this environment, Nexans must constantly invest and improve its performance in order to retain any competitive advantages it may have in certain markets. In addition, the Group is continuing its efforts in R&D, logistics, and marketing in order to differentiate itself from the competition. At the same time, faced with constant downward pressure on prices, Nexans is focused on reducing costs through continuously streamlining its production processes as well as plans to boost its manufacturing performance. These restructuring measures are expected to cost approximately 30 million euros per year.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.9,Risks related to technologies used,13.9.1,,"In order to remain competitive, Nexans must anticipate advances in technology when developing its own products and manufacturing processes. The demand for products that consume less energy, are recyclable and less polluting, and especially better value products, require the creation of innovative manufacturing processes, the use of new materials and the development of new wires and cables. Most of the markets in which Nexans has a presence tend to favor the use of highly technological products; it is therefore important that Nexans undertakes research providing it with access to the technologies necessary and valued by the market. Moreover, despite its Research and Development efforts and the ongoing monitoring of potentially competing technologies, there is no guarantee that the technologies currently used by Nexans will not ultimately be replaced by new technologies developed by its leading competitors, or that its competitors will not allege infringement, or that Nexans will be able to successfully launch new products that respond perfectly to customer demand.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.10,Risks related to environmental regulations,13.10.1,,"Nexans is subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the environment in each of the countries where it operates, in particular in the European Union, the United States and Canada. These laws and regulations impose increasingly strict environmental standards, particularly in relation to atmospheric pollution, wastewater disposal, the emission, use and handling of toxic materials and waste, waste disposal methods, site cleanups and treatment. These standards expose Nexans to the possibility of liability claims being filed against it, and to significant costs (e.g. for liability with respect to current or past activities or related to assets sold). The Group has a voluntary internal environmental management system that has been operational for several years. This system is intended to lead to the EHP label being awarded, denoting the Group’s compliance with the highest environmental standards. For further information in this regard, see Section 16.1 of the Management Report on pages 89 to 94 of this Prospectus. ----- In France, the government department responsible for the environment has published a national directory of potentially polluted sites and launched a program to examine and clean up these sites. As a result, Nexans has started investigations or remediation activities at four of its sites. In the United States, Nexans is subject to several federal and state environmental laws, which could make certain categories of entity defined by law liable for the full amount of cleanup costs relating to environmental pollution, even if no fault is determined and the relevant operations comply with applicable regulations. Nexans has often been cited, together with others, as potentially liable for pollution pursuant to the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Nexans has been joined to these proceedings although the pollution referred to is associated with waste dumps and did not arise on its manufacturing or production sites. The potential liability of Nexans in relation to these proceedings has not adversely affected its financial position or income in the past but it cannot be guaranteed that there will be no negative effects in the future. In general, various types of environmental claims are made against the Group in the normal course of business. Based on the amounts claimed and the status of the proceedings concerned, together with its evaluation of the risks involved and its provisioning policy, Nexans believes that there is little risk that these claims will significantly affect its financial position or income. The main environmental claim currently outstanding against the Group concerns a dispute in Duisburg, Germany, brought by the purchasers of a site and a city council relating to soil and ground water contamination. This soil contamination is long-standing and Nexans’ full liability has not been established although analyses are currently underway. Nexans has, however, recorded provisions to cover any responsibility it may have for cleanup costs. Nexans applies the following rules when recognizing provisions in relation to environmental matters. A provision is recognized when the information and documents available indicate that a future outgoing of economic resources is likely, significant and quantifiable. If these criteria are not met, any such potential outgoings of economic resources are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements where the amount concerned is material. Where such an outgoing is unlikely no provision is recognized and no disclosure is made in the notes to the financial statements. Nexans estimates environmental remediation or cleanup costs on a case-by-case basis and as accurately as possible, based on the information available. At December 31, 2006, the amount of provisions recorded for environmental risks was 6.446 million euros. These provisions include amounts relating to the above-mentioned dispute in Duisburg, the cleanup of a waste dump on the site of its Swedish subsidiary and others costs related to current or planned soil cleanup operations after the use of products such as solvents or oil, at sites including Bramsche in Germany and Buizingen in Belgium. In addition, additional expenses may be incurred for the clean-up of sites that have been closed and are likely to be sold. However, the Company expects that these expenses will represent less than the market value of the sites in question. Nexans believes that unprovisioned costs for the cleanup of sites that have not yet been audited should not have a significant impact on its earnings. Nexans cannot guarantee that future events, in particular changes in legislation or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions, will not lead to additional costs that could have a significant adverse effect on its business, financial position or income.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.11,Nexans’ position on asbestos,13.11.1,,"The manufacture of Nexans products does not involve any handling of asbestos. In the past (and particularly to comply with French army specifications), asbestos was used to a limited extent to improve the insulation of certain kinds of cables to be used for military purposes. It was also used in the manufacture of enameled ovens at two sites in France, but this activity was discontinued several decades ago. ----- To date, 41 people in France have been classified as suffering from an occupational disease, of which 8 have filed proceedings against their employer (TLM ). In addition, some 84 employees (44 at Nexans Wires and 40 at SCCC) are subject to medical monitoring. Management does not believe that this risk is likely to have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position or earnings.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.12,Insurance coverage,13.12.1,,"In addition to local mandatory insurance coverage and individual insurance taken out directly by the Group’s various units, Nexans has had a Group insurance program in place since 2003. Companies in which Nexans has more than a 50% stake are eligible to participate in this program. The overall coverage under this program changed little during 2006 compared to the previous year and was renewed on January 1, 2007 at similar levels, with the exception of coverage for space industry products which was, as in 2006, less than the coverage obtained through 2004. The main types of insurance coverage under this program are as follows: – property and casualty and business interruption, – general civil operating and product liability, – transportation, – contractor’s all risk insurance for land-based projects, – aeronautic and space civil liability, – short-term credit risk to secure accounts receivable from certain domestic and export customers, Directors’ liability. The limits on these policies are based on a historical analysis of the company’s claims experience and on the advice of its brokers. They generally exceed the maximum amount of insured claims experienced by the Group in the past. These policies are, however, subject to coverage exclusions that result in limitations on the transfer of risk. The property and casualty and business interruption policy is subject to limitations applicable to certain units. Certain countries or regions are currently excluded from the Group’s insurance program (e.g. Nigeria) and certain geographical areas have more limited coverage for risks related to natural catastrophes, including areas with high seismic risk such as Greece, Italy, and Turkey. The short-term credit risk policy has been rolled out country by country as part of a global, multi-year program renewed in 2006 for two years. At the end of 2006, companies in the Group’s scope of consolidation that had subscribed to this policy made up 80% of Nexans consolidated sales. With respect to civil liability resulting from aeronautic or space products, coverage for damages caused to third parties is limited to the occurrence of severe accidents or decisions to ground aircraft made by domestic or international civil aviation authorities, and excludes all other kinds of liability. It is possible that very infrequent yet highly serious claims may considerably exceed the related sales generated and significantly affect Nexans’ operating income. Finally, there is a trend among third parties, customers and suppliers, as well as in the insurance market, towards increased litigation to limit or expand the scope of contractual undertakings. The possibility of legal action being taken creates further uncertainties as to the amount of risk transferred. ----- With respect to political risk, the Group has no coverage for financial assets shown on the balance sheet. Risks related to acts of terrorism are covered by the insurance legally required in certain countries. Nexans does not have any captive insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries. However, in December 2006, the Accounts and Audit Committee authorized the creation of a reinsurance subsidiary so as to better manage the Group’s risk retention. This subsidiary should be operational in 2008, and will become progressively more involved in Nexans’ insurance program in line with opportunities and limitations in the insurance market. The Group relies on the expertise of a global network of insurance brokers to assist it in the control and management of the risks to which it is exposed in all the countries where it operates. Nexans has strengthened its commitment to reducing industrial risks by putting in place a specific 3year investment program for 2005 through 2007. This program was designed in close cooperation between the Industrial Management Department and experts from the Group’s property and casualty insurer. These experts visit the industrial sites on an annual basis, making very specific recommendations on how to improve risk prevention and safety, and they monitor the implementation of these recommendations.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

These results reflect a buoyant economic climate, especially in our energy cables business which is enjoying vibrant demand across the globe. These results are also the fruit of our aggressive, targeted growth strategy designed to boost the company’s profitability and increase sales faster than the sector average. We have made Nexans a more resistant company, cut its fixed costs, made its plants more efficient, and expanded its product range. We also enlarged its footprint by expanding into the most dynamic, lucrative markets in rapidly-developing regions such as South America, i.e. in Brazil, and the Middle East. We increased our presence in Asia-Pacific substantially with the acquisition of Olex, the region’s leading cable manufacturer. We created organizations that are closer to our customers and stepped-up our R&D spending. And perhaps most significantly, we were able to maintain margins despite the ----- skyrocketing prices of copper and plastics that make up over half of the manufacturing costs of our cables – by passing on those increases and continuously lowering our costs. We achieved the goals of our 2005-2007 strategic plan one year ahead of schedule.

This new plan will allow Nexans to accelerate its business growth, and become more profitable, more resistant, and more streamlined. Energy will be at the core of our business development, and our strategy is built around our energy infrastructure, industry, and building businesses. We will be more targeted in the telecom activity by focusing on higher value-added cables and systems. In the electrical wires and wire rods activities, we plan to shift towards manufacturing to supply only the company’s own needs. We target consolidated sales approaching 5 billion euros by 2009 (at constant metal prices), which corresponds to an average annual growth rate of 6%, excluding acquisitions and scaled-down businesses. This sales growth will require an increasing amount of financial and human resources. We plan to invest in capacity upgrades, enrich our product range, and penetrate new markets. 500 million euros will be allocated to manufacturing capital expenditures between 2007 and 2009, of which 80% will be spent on three priority areas: energy infrastructure, industry, and buildings. Our operating margin target for 2009 is 7.5%, with a ROCE close to 13% (at 2006 copper prices). To get there, we plan to focus on driving sales from higher-margin businesses, growing sales to the industrial markets, boosting profitability, and striving to better understand and meet our customers’ needs.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3324,CORPORATE GOVERNANCE,3324.19,Operations of the Board of Directors,3324.19.1,,"Since its listing on the stock exchange, Nexans has adopted a number of rules relating to corporate governance with a view to ensuring transparency of information with respect to both its directors and its shareholders. The Board of Directors is currently made up of 11 members. They come from diverse backgrounds and were selected for their expertise and experience in industry, banking, or consultancy, enabling them to give informed opinions and advice in the best interests of the Company. The Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of June 3, 2004 decided to reduce the length of Directors’ term of office from six years to four years, starting with terms beginning during the 2004 financial year. No category of shareholder is represented on the Board of Directors, and no Director is elected by the employees. Once again this year, the Board of Directors has followed the recommendations of the combined Viénot-Bouton Report of June 2003, and at its January 30, 2007 meeting reviewed the situation of each of its members with regard to the criteria governing independence defined in the Report as reflected in the Company’s Internal Regulations. The latter specifies in particular that in the Group’s relations with businesses and banks in which any of its directors have an interest, independence will be determined according to the level of sales made to such companies, which is fixed at 10%, or in respect of investment banks and financial share of business given to them. The aim is to determine whether these relationships are of an importance and nature such that they could affect the independence and freedom of judgement of the directors concerned. Based on these criteria, the Board of Directors determined that Gianpaolo Caccini, Jean-Marie Chevalier, Jacques Garaïalde, Colette Lewiner, Yves Lyon-Caen, Patrick Puy, François Polge de Combret, and Jean-Louis Vinciguerra should be considered to be independent Directors. The Board of Directors determined that the other Directors were not independent: Gérard Hauser, in view of his position as Chairman and CEO of the Company, and Georges Chodron de Courcel and Ervin Rosenbrg, owing to their positions within BNP Paribas and La Compagnie Financière Edmond de Rothschild Banque, which are two banks with whom the Group has business relationships. Eight out of the eleven directors are therefore independent, representing more than half of the Board members, a proportion in accordance with the recommendations of the Viénot-Bouton Report. There are no family links between the Board members, and there are no service contracts between any of the Board members and the Company or any of its subsidiaries. No loans or guarantees have been granted or established for the benefit of a corporate officer by the Company or a company within its Group. Proceedings have been started against Patrick Puy further to the placing in official receivership of the Moulinex-Brandt group of which he was one of the main Directors in the 10 months before it was placed in receivership. To date, Mr Puy has not been found guilty of any offenses. To the best knowledge of the Company, during the past five years: – no Board member has been convicted of fraud; ----- – no other Board member has been associated with any bankruptcy, placing into receivership, or liquidation of a company; – no other Board member has been the subject of an incrimination or official public sanction by any statutory or regulatory authorities; – no Board member has been prohibited by court order from serving on an administrative, executive, or supervisory body of a public company, or from participating in the management of business of a public company.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

The buildings business in the US also posted a weak second half, although prices remained high. Demand in the shipbuilding and aerospace market segments held up well, while that for power cables grew substantially thanks to transmission and distribution network upgrades and large interconnection projects between the United States and Canada. In the telecom business, Nexans enjoyed healthy demand which helped drive sales of its high valueadded LAN cables. The developing Asian economies continued to grow at a healthy pace, which translated into strong demand for cables in all markets amid fierce competition. However, Nexans could not benefit fully from this positive climate due to difficulties in offsetting the higher copper prices, particularly in China and Vietnam. In the developed countries, Australia saw continued hefty investments in telecoms, industry, buildings, and power networks. The Rest of the World region comprises South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and the Former Soviet Republics. Many countries in this region contributed to Nexans’ revenue growth in 2006, including Morocco, Turkey, and Lebanon. The abundant oil and gas resources owned by countries in the Middle East and Central Asia have enabled them to accelerate their industrialization efforts and energy and communications network interconnections – large projects in which Nexans is actively involved.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

The region benefited from a favorable economy, which fuelled both domestic and international markets, more efficient, productive manufacturing and logistics operations, and structured sales efforts, especially those targeted towards Nexans’ priority segments that were chosen for their growth potential and high margins. In January 2006, Nexans sold its distribution business in Switzerland for a gain of 149 million euros as part of its strategy to focus on its core businesses. Necessary capacity and productivity investments were made, along with restructurings at manufacturing sites in France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. 48 million euros were provisioned in 2006 for the restructurings, and 112 million euros were spent to support the strong demand for highvoltage, medium-voltage, and umbilical cables for energy networks, as well as developments in the company’s priority market segments. 2006 also saw Nexans complete a targeted acquisition with the purchase of Confecta, a leading Swiss supplier of industrial harnesses for the railway and manufacturing sectors in Europe.

The production of LAN cables at Abbey Wood, UK, was successfully transferred to Turkey due to fierce competition from Chinese imports. Nexans also made significant investments to boost the operating performance of all its plants. Production capacity was increased in several areas, including automotive cables in Romania, cables for the petrochemical market, and high-voltage submarine and umbilical cables in Norway; capacity at the Halden, Norway, plant will grow by over 50% in 2007. ----- In Japan, Nexans acquired a majority stake in a joint venture with Viscas, which will give it access to the Japanese company’s high-voltage submarine cable production plant in Tokyo Bay – one of the best-equipped manufacturing facilities in the world for these types of products. Indeed, to further serve the booming submarine cable market, Nexans made a strategic move by purchasing the cable-laying vessel C/S Nexans Skagerrak. Submarine cable installation is often included in the company’s supply contracts, and there are only two ships in the world that can do this profitably while meeting technical specifications.

Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories,3336.13.1,,"Following the adoption of IFRSs on January 1, 2004, inventories of non-ferrous metals, referred to as “core exposure”, were classified as property, plant, and equipment. These assets correspond to the quantities of non-ferrous metals needed for regular plant operations. Their volume is maintained and is continually replenished; therefore they are not hedged by futures contracts. As they were classified as property, plant, and equipment, these inventories were recorded at historical cost at January 1, 2004. They were not depreciated as their residual value is greater than their carrying amount and they have indefinite useful lives. However, inventories of non-ferrous metals other than those used as core exposure were recognized as inventories and measured at purchase cost as calculated by the weighted average cost method. The accounting methods applied by the Group in relation to these inventories in 2004 and 2005 is discussed on page 10 of the document entitled “Transition to IFRS Standards” included in Nexans’ 2004 Annual Report. In the 2006 consolidated financial statements, the above-mentioned materials previously classified as property, plant, and equipment have been reclassified as inventories, and are now therefore measured using the average weighted cost method. The financial statements for 2004 and 2005 have been restated using this new classification in order to facilitate year-on-year comparisons. At the time of its transition to IFRS, Nexans classified core exposure as property, plant, and equipment with a view to neutralizing the effect of metal price fluctuations on the income statement, in line with the Group’s risk management policy for metals. Nexans used the LIFO method before adopting IFRS. In view of recent market conditions, Nexans – along with the other European groups faced with the same situation – reviewed the IFRSs applicable concerning the recognition and measurement of this type of inventory. This review led to the Group’s decision described above to measure all non-ferrous metals inventories using the weighted average cost method. Given the surge in non-ferrous metal prices over the past three years, this new method will better reflect the value of the inventories presented in the Group’s balance sheet. ----- The rise in non-ferrous metal prices and the subsequent revaluation of core exposure using the weighted average cost method served to increase the working capital included in the company’s nonfinancial assets that must be tested for impairment whenever there is evidence of a loss in value. This in turn led to higher impairment losses recognized for certain cash-generating units at December 31, 2005. ### 1.1.2. Acquisitions of significant equity interest in other companies � On December 1, 2006, Nexans acquired the entire capital of the Australian group Olex for an enterprise value of 312 million euros. This acquisition, Nexans’ largest to date, strengthens the Group’s core business and doubles its presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Olex employs 910 people and generated 330 million euros in sales in 2006 at current metal prices, or 240 million euros at constant metal prices. Olex has three production sites, located at Tottenham and Lilydale in Australia, and New Plymouth in New Zealand. It also has a dozen sales offices spanning Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and China. The company makes cables for power transmission and distribution (33% of its sales), specialty products, primarily for the mining industry (24%), and cables for the building, energy and telecommunications markets (43%). As the impact of this acquisition on Nexans’ consolidated sales, operating margin, and net income was not material for 2006, Olex has only been consolidated by the Group since December 31 of that year. � In the second half of 2006, Nexans and Viscas, a joint venture between Furukawa Electric Co., Ltd. and Fujikura Ltd., created the Nippon High Voltage Cable Corp. (NVC) based in Japan. Nexans owns 66% of the new company with Viscas (JV Furukowa Electric Co., Ltd et Fujikura Ltd) owning the remaining 34%. As part of this operation, Viscas contributed its existing manufacturing plant in Tokyo Bay to the new entity. NVC will manufacture high-voltage submarine power cables exclusively for its two shareholders, and will have no other operations. NVC was consolidated into the Nexans Group on December 31, 2006. � In January 2006, Nexans acquired a 100% stake in Confecta, a European maker of cable harnesses for the railway and other industrial sectors. The company was previously owned by four private shareholders. Confecta employs approximately 180 people and generates annual consolidated sales of some 20 million euros. The group comprises six companies – Confecta Holding, Confecta AG, Confecta Verbindungstechnik and Confecta Fiberoptic in Switzerland, Confecta GmbH in Germany and Confecta SAS in France. � Also during the year, Nexans created the Vietnam-based Nexans Lioa in which it holds a 60% stake. The remaining 40% is held by two Vietnamese companies which contributed their cable manufacturing businesses for energy networks, equipment, and industry. Nexans Lioa was consolidated into the Nexans Group in May 2006, and is currently in the operational start-up phase. � Nexans increased its interest in its Korean subsidiaries Nexans Korea and Kukdong Electrical Wire to 99.5% and 97.9%, respectively, for a total price of 42 million euros. � Nexans bought out certain minority shareholders in Morocco, increasing its stake from 74.6% to 83.6%, and raised its interest in China-based Nanning Huasun Cable to 100%.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

At constant non-ferrous metal prices, the figure came to 4,442 million euros compared to 4,263 million euros in 2005. At constant non-ferrous metal prices and constant 2006 exchange rates, sales for 2006 rose by 3.3%, and based on constant exchange rates and a comparable scope of consolidation (like-for-like) the increase came to 8.2%. Operating margin amounted to 259.8 million euros, or 5.8% of sales at constant metal prices (3.5% at current metal prices), and net income attributable to the Group stood at 241 million euros. These figures represent a significant improvement on 2005 when operating margin was 185.9 million euros, or 4.4% of sales, and attributable net income totaled 108 million euros.

In the land-based infrastructure sector, growth was particularly buoyant (7.1% on a like-for-like basis). Demand in Europe was fuelled by investment spending in network maintenance, which saturated the medium-voltage cable production facility. High-voltage terrestrial cables saw new international contract wins despite stiff competition, most notably in rapidly developing countries and in the Middle East. In North America, demand for low-voltage power distribution and overhead cables picked up as the effects of the 2005 Energy Bill began to be felt, while in Brazil, Nexans benefited from the government’s “Luz Para Todos” initiative to expand the country’s electricity network. In Lebanon, despite the tense political situation, business held firm at 2005 levels and the Group’s production site was spared from the negative impacts of the conflict. Finally, Turkey had an excellent year, both in terms of financial performance as well as progress in adapting to the manufacturing equipment conversion program started in 2006.

These included a direct electrical heating system for underwater pipes for a Statoil oil field, a 296 km highvoltage submarine cable to supply electricity to the Valhall offshore oil field (in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea), a 60 km three-core AC cable for the Long Island Replacement Cable project in the US (the biggest 138 kV cable ever built), and an 80 km electricity supply cable for Delma Island in Abu Dhabi. Given the challenging environmental conditions for some of these contracts, the Group had to allocate more resources than originally planned. To serve this rapidly-growing market, Nexans made sizeable investments to expand capacity at its Halden manufacturing plant in Norway, and integrated a new production unit in Japan as part of a joint venture with Viscas. This new unit in Japan will increase the company’s high-voltage submarine cable production capacity by 33%. In addition, Nexans bought the C/S Skagerrak, one of the world’s most powerful cable-laying vessels, thus bolstering its submarine cable resources. In low-voltage cables for the building sector, like-for-like sales jumped 12.6%. Overall, the dynamic market allowed the Group to offset the surge in copper prices during the year and strong demand lifted earnings considerably. In Europe, demand from the residential building sector continued to be robust (18) Olex has been fully consolidated since December 31, 2006 ----- (e.g., in Greece, Spain, the Netherlands, and Turkey), while in North America, a healthy business climate generated solid earnings. In industrial cables, like-for-like sales rose by a robust 9.4%. The shipbuilding and offshore platform markets proved to be particularly contributive in 2006, thanks to the Group’s leadership position backed by the Kukdong plant in Korea and the Nexans plant in Shanghai. Harnesses benefited from successful high-end products for the German car market, as well as growing demand for truck harnesses in the US. Nexans further strengthened its presence in the industrial harnesses market (railways) with the Confecta acquisition. In addition, the ramp-up of automotive cable production lines in Morocco and Romania is well on track, and contributing to the Group’s expansion. Nexans refocus on its priority segments, helped boost sales of cables for material handling, petrochemical, and nuclear applications. The Group is currently implementing a conversion program for its copper instrumentation cable production lines in Brazil, Turkey, and Lebanon, in order to increase manufacturing capacity. Operating margin for the Energy division was 233 million euros in 2006 compared to 171 million in 2005. This sharp rise is largely the result of the recovery reported by the industrial cables business and particularly good performance in low-voltage cables for the building sector. TELECOM Sales in the Telecom business advanced 2.9% to 648 million euros (1.7% on a like-for-like basis). In a low growth market, Nexans’ business was fueled by investments in railway infrastructure and demand for high-speed LAN cables. Like-for-like sales for the public network cables business contracted 2.5% in 2006, hurt by plummeting demand for ADSL cables in Europe and limited telephone network investment in developing countries. In light of these factors, some of Nexans’ production units converted their equipment to industrial cable manufacturing. However, demand for fiber cables remained robust in Northern Europe due to a proliferation of local loop networks. In the private networks sector, sales edged up 1.7% on a like-for-like basis. The lack of major building cable projects in Europe put pressure on sales volumes. Nevertheless, profitability improved due to higher margins from the copper telecom businesses in Norway and Spain, as well as stronger sales of category 6 and 7 cables and cabling systems. Because market perspectives did not allow a clear visibility on the timing for a recovery in European volumes, it has been decided to close the Group’s loss-making Abbey Wood site in the UK and transfer the equipment to the Tuzla plant in Turkey. Profitability in the US improved considerably thanks to the Group’s strategy of focusing on higher-end products, although sales of copper LAN cables did fall slightly. The Elm City plant is continuing to implement its manufacturing improvement plan, and has installed the latest aerospace cable production technology. Sales advanced 12% in 2006, on the back of 25% growth in the previous year. In industrial electronic cables, a stagnant ADSL market and fierce competition from Asia led Nexans to close its Opglabbeek site and transfer some of the equipment to sites in Fumay, France, and Kanghua, China. The main growth drivers in this business were cables for the aerospace industry (despite the difficulties encountered by the Airbus A380 program) and geophysics applications. Operating margin almost doubled in 2006 to 48 million euros, from 25 million euros in 2005, thanks to a better product mix across the Group and continued cost-cutting efforts. ----- ELECTRICAL WIRES Sales in the Electrical Wires business in 2006 were 801 million euros, up 5.7% on 2005 or 3.1% on a like-for-like basis. In the wirerod segment, there was a modest increase in demand from non-Group customers. In North America, buoyant demand in the first half of the year gave way to a sharp slowdown in the second. Sales were also impacted by the Group’s decision to gradually reduce its exposure to the copper market. Furthermore, the plunge in copper prices at the end of the year prompted Nexans’ customers to adopt a wait-and-see approach. In the bare wire segment, sales contracted 6%, although performance was mixed across different countries. Germany saw robust demand for specialty products for the automotive industry, while sales tumbled in France where Nexans sells more commodity products. In winding wires, where the products that Nexans makes are mainly for power transformers in Canada and China, sales benefited from heavy investment spending in energy networks. As a result of these difficult market conditions the operating margin of the Electrical Wires division dropped to a negative 4 million euros compared to a positive 6 million euros in 2005. Profitability was further impacted by a non-recurring provision recorded in relation to a legal dispute. UNALLOCATED OPERATIONS Certain of Nexans’ operations incur expenses which are labeled “unallocated” because they cannot be attributed directly to one of the Group’s defined businesses or regions. These amounts are not material on a consolidated level, representing a negative operating margin impact of 18 million euros in 2006, compared with a negative 16 million euros in 2005.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3336,BOOST OUR EFFICIENCY,3336.17,1.2.2.2. By geographical area,3336.17.1,,"EUROPE Europe recorded sales of 3,021 million euros in 2006, up 1.1% on 2005, or 8.5% on a like-for-like basis. Most of Nexans’ businesses in the region continued to recover, propelled by a favorable economic climate, enhanced product mix and sales efforts, manufacturing facility rationalization, and cost-cutting efforts. 68% of Nexans’ sales were made in Europe, and the region received over 60% of the Group’s capital expenditure and accounted for the majority of its restructuring costs. � Sales in the European Energy business rose 1.3% in 2006, or 12.1% on a like-for-like basis. The operating margin climbed from 4.7% to 5.9%. Energy continues to be Nexans’ largest business in Europe, generating 73% of its sales and 87% of its operating margin. Sales from industrial cable harnesses jumped 18.6% in 2006, or 6.4% based on a comparable scope of consolidation, which in turn boosted the operating margin to 7.8%. This outstanding performance can be attributed to continued strong sales of high value-added products – which Nexans has identified as “priority segments” in its Strategic Plan – coupled with the impact of the Confecta acquisition in the industrial harnesses market. Sales volumes of low-voltage cables for the building sector also rose sharply in 2006, especially in housing markets across Europe. This increase, combined with sustained cost-cutting efforts, helped push operating margins upwards. ----- Demand for low- and medium-voltage cables and accessories for power networks grew in Northern Europe and Italy. In addition, several projects such as the Lötschberg tunnel in Switzerland were finalized in 2006. High-voltage cables and accessories also saw an upswing in sales thanks to sizable oil sector investments in both land and submarine cables. In order to meet this booming demand, Nexans increased production capacity at its Halden plant in Norway, and entered into agreement with Viscas to create a new company in Japan. However, profits from this business were pressured by technically complex contracts for umbilical cables. � Sales in the European Telecom business edged up 2.2% in 2006, but held steady on a like-for-like basis. However, the operating margin grew from 2.6% of sales in 2005 to 4.7% as Nexans refocused its operations. Sales of telecom network cables stabilized in 2006, although they slipped 1.2% on a like-for-like basis. Results were mixed in different segments. Sales of submarine optical fiber cables in Norway surged due to high business levels in the hydrocarbon sector, while a scarcity of major projects in Central Europe and a slowdown in ADSL deployment hurt sales of copper cables and accessories to telecom operators. Nexans continued to rationalize its manufacturing facilities in 2006, closing its Opglabbeek plant in Belgium and transferring part of its production to sites in France and Spain. Sales from LAN cables rose in 2006 due to the full-year impact of the UK business acquired in 2005, as well as sustained growth in sales of category 6 and 7 cables related to stepped-up cabling systems development. Finally, strong momentum in the aerospace and oil segments drove a 5.4% rise in sales of electronic cables. � Sales in the European Electrical Wires business held firm at 2005 levels, although profitability improved thanks to a more targeted marketing approach and a focus on specialty products. NORTH AMERICA In North America, Nexans recorded sales totaling 813 million, an increase of 7.9% compared with 2005 (4.7% like-for-like). Operating margin was up over 50% in absolute terms following an excellent 2005, as a result of favorable prices and strong positioning in strategic markets. � In power cables, including land infrastructure and buildings, sales climbed 4.2% at constant exchange rates. Cables for industry and buildings had a solid year with higher operating margins, despite a sluggish second half. The infrastructure market proved to be highly profitable due to network maintenance and expansion requirements in North America; this was particularly true for mediumvoltage cables where prices rebounded. � In the telecom sector, like-for-like sales inched up 0.9%. Nexans decided to focus on high-end applications for LAN cables and reduce its exposure to the very competitive low-end cable market. Although overall sales volumes declined in 2006, volumes of high added-value cables (category 6 and above) were up significantly. This strategy boosted profitability substantially, helped by hedges on the business’ raw materials. 2006 also saw a turnaround in the optical fiber cables business in spite of a stagnant market. In the shipbuilding and aerospace segments, Nexans continued to build sales and resist strong competition. � Wirerods experienced a turbulent year. Sales started 2006 well only to fall off in the second half. This reflected both a retreat in the overall market (i.e., a slowdown in the US economy, particularly in ----- the construction sector) and Nexans’ desire to scale back volumes in this resource-consuming business in light of the surge in copper prices. � Winding wires benefited from a buoyant energy distribution market as transformers in North America are going through a replacement cycle. Nexans’ winding wire production plant needs however to continue to improve its manufacturing performance. ASIA-PACIFIC In the Asia-Pacific region, sales rose from 247 million euros in 2005 to 277 million euros in 2006, up 12% on a published basis, or 6.3% like-for-like. Operating margin grew from 4.6% in 2005 to 6.8% in 2006, thanks to Nexans’ strategy of maintaining prices and quality while being more selective in its sales approach. In Korea, like-for-like sales dipped 2.1%, although the business’ profitability improved. Sales volumes of cables for shipbuilding remained robust, reflecting a healthy market that prompted Nexans to increase its capacity at the end of the year. Cables for the automotive industry benefited from a rapidly-growing domestic market. However, sales of telecom cables, power cables for the building sector, and medium-voltage cables proved disappointing as high copper prices caused operators to scale back orders. Sales in China bounded 33% at constant exchange rates. All of Nexans’ cable manufacturing businesses gained ground, including the special cables business which started operations in 2005. Most of the special cables produced in 2006 were sold to the shipbuilding industry, although sales are starting to expand into other sectors such as railways. Vietnam reported a 23% increase in like-for-like sales. The best performers during the year were power cables, particularly bare overhead cables, whose sales helped to fuel increased export activity. In addition, Nexans and Lioa created a joint venture based in Hanoi to manufacture low- and mediumvoltage power cables. This new company, which began operations in the second half of 2006, will increase Nexans’ production capacity for the Vietnamese market. REST OF THE WORLD The Rest of the World area reported strong sales growth: 330 million euros in 2006 compared with 275 million euros in 2005, representing an increase of 20% (16.9% on a like-for-like basis). In Turkey like-for-like sales soared 47.5%. The Denizli plant reaped the benefits of a strong market for low- and medium-voltage power cables, both in its domestic market and in the UK and Ireland, which the plant now serves. Meanwhile, the Tuzla plant, which had previously made copper telecom cables, was converted to more promising products in terms of market development such as instrumentation cables for the oil segment. The plant also began manufacturing LAN cables for Nexans’ European customers at the end of 2006. In Morocco, sales jumped 22.9% at constant exchange rates, propelled by Nexans’ solid position in a dynamic energy market. Sales of cables for the building sector and electrical equipment were especially strong following the Moroccan government’s initiatives to extend electricity lines into rural areas. Nexans Morocco has developed special electrical equipment tailored to this market. The Mohammedia plant was restructured in 2006 in order to help drive sales of cables for the automotive industry; a market that is continuing to perform well. Profitability in Brazil improved despite stable sales volumes, thanks to progress in the LAN business. ----- Lebanon had an outstanding year, in spite of the turbulent political climate in the country since mid2006. Like-for-like sales rose 6.2% fueled by high export levels. Egypt suffered from falling demand for copper telecom cables. However, because demand for medium- and high-voltage power cables in Egypt is still increasing, Nexans invested heavily in 2006 with a view to improving the performance of its manufacturing equipment serving this market.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

However, due to the sharp volatility in non-ferrous metal prices over the past several months, the Group invested in measures that enabled in a large portion of these financial instruments to be classified as cash flow hedges as defined in IAS 39. As from November 1, 2006, when these instruments are used to hedge future transactions that are highly probable but not yet invoiced (e.g., copper cathode purchases), and they meet the requirements set forth in IAS 39 for cash flow hedge accounting, they are treated similarly to foreign currency hedges, as follows: the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognized directly in equity, and the ineffective portion is recognized in the line item “Change in fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives.” Gains or losses previously recognized in equity are taken to the income statement in the period during which the hedged item (e.g., copper cathode purchases) affects income. In 2006, the income statement impact of changes in the fair value of non-ferrous metal derivatives represented a loss of 7 million euros, compared with a gain of 33 million euros in 2005. -----",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3336,BOOST OUR EFFICIENCY,3336.28,3. Progress made and difficulties encountered,3336.28.1,,"Progress was made in several essential areas during the year: - Control of fixed and direct costs – This was a main focus for the Group in 2006 as its businesses continued to expand. Efforts made to contain direct costs and improve the product mix improved the variable cost margin considerably. - Materials consumption – Nexans cut the amount of waste generated by its cable business by 3%, and generated substantial savings through a new plastics procurement policy and a variety of materials consumption reduction efforts, most notably in the area of composites. - Manufacturing methods and best practices – 67 engineers and technicians from 30 production sites attended training given by Nexans’ Industrial Management Department on problem-solving methods and analytical applications. In addition, a workshop on the Group’s extrusion know-how was added to the technical training catalogue in 2006, and was very popular among the production sites using extrusion techniques. - Workplace safety – Thanks to the successful roll-out of Nexans’ safety charter, the workplace accident rate dropped by about 10% in 2006, and absenteeism fell by 0.6 percentage points. All of the above initiatives helped improve production site operations and reduce the number of customer complaints. Furthermore, fixed costs as a percentage of revenues declined during the year, as a result of strict cost controls associated with restructuring and reorganization plans. In terms of Nexans’ IT systems, several projects started four years ago were completed successfully in 2006, and goals were set for the next three years (2007 to 2009). As technology continues to advance rapidly, Nexans has focused on upgrading its IT systems, particularly with regards to integrated business management software. All the projects outlined in the Group’s strategic plan were completed. A roll-out of SAP software and a specific application for car harness production began in 2006, and met full satisfaction of users. SAP was also installed in order to manage continuous copper casting operations in France and Germany, because their legacy applications could no longer be used following the sale of the winding wire business. Several projects using Navision software were also initiated to support the growth of the Group’s smaller units (e.g., in China, Lebanon, Romania, Ghana, Japan, and Nexans logistics in the UK). As part of the Group’s global focus on data security, several enhancements were made to its network infrastructure, and annual vulnerability tests confirmed that permanent progress has been made. Nexans also performed an internal audit using the Information Security Forum method, underscoring this aspect of the Group’s risk management process. Cost cutting targets were reached one year ahead of schedule, with IT expenses amounting to 1.2% of sales at constant copper prices. The Group has reduced IT expenses by 23% over the past three years – corresponding to over 16 million euros of savings – without cutting into needed infrastructure investments or application upgrades. Going forward, Nexans plans to maintain IT expenses at their current level and to continue to monitor spending. The Group has outlined several structuring projects, including a call for tenders to supply and manage its WAN after its contract with AT&T ends in December 2007. Nexans’ WAN has recently been upgraded to include new services and telephony. Nexans also amended its SAP contracts so that the software can be used on a long-term basis under a license agreement, including software upgrades from the supplier. At the same time, the Group intends to continue its process of replacing obsolete applications, with the largest projects being in Canada and Switzerland. Several business support functions have been enhanced, and a project to improve detailed planning at the Group’s plants is already underway; the software has been purchased and configured internally for rapid deployment. Finally, Nexans has reorganized its website and e-services site so that they can be used more easily by its various partners (customers, suppliers, transporters, financial firms, etc.). The main difficulties encountered in 2006 related to the impact of significantly higher prices for raw materials, including the copper price which soared 76% year-on-year. As a result, Nexans’ sales team was forced to pass on a large portion of these increases to its customers in order to protect the Group’s margins on its full range of products. These elevated raw materials prices also meant considerably ----- higher purchasing costs, which increased the business working capital requirements. Finally, the heavy demand placed on Nexans’ plants strained the capacity of some manufacturing facilities and caused occasional delivery delays.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

The Group’s R&D program is designed to maintain and improve its market position by developing new products and improving the safety and quality of the production processes through increased efficiency. Nexans’ technical capabilities include some 450 staff with high-performance equipment. The Group’s R&D teams work on long-term projects – such as understanding mechanisms and developing innovative insulation and sheathing materials – which are essentially managed by its Research Center (NRC), as well as short and medium-term projects, such as the creation and testing of new products and systems or the use of computer modeling to accelerate time-to-market for products that perform better or meet new specifications. Some 59 patents have been registered for the Group’s various areas of activity, reflecting the quality of its technical teams.

The cable is laid alongside the track rather than strung across towers. It is currently being used by Die Bahn, the German national railway (formerly Deutsche Bahn). ### - A new-generation DSL cable selected for pilot studies by France Telecom. - A 10 Gbit/s cable that has been approved in the USA.  - A heating cable resistant to alkaline corrosion due to cement (approved for the Scandinavian market). - Automotive cables approved for use in temperatures between 125°C and 150°C.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3336,BOOST OUR EFFICIENCY,3336.30,5. Trends,3336.30.1,,"In January 2007, Nexans presented to its Board of Directors a new Strategic Plan for 2007-2009 after achieving the targets set in its previous plan one year ahead of schedule. While the economic climate has not changed fundamentally from the time when the priorities of the previous plan were set (i.e., moderate growth in Europe, more vibrant growth in North America, and substantial potential in Asia and the Rest of the World region), the trends seen at the end of 2005 have intensified. Demand for power cables remains strong, with competition increasingly fierce at the lower end of the market, against a backdrop of extremely high raw materials prices. All these factors have required Nexans to invest an increasing amount of human and financial resources. As a result, the Group’s targets in the new Plan are to improve profitability, reduce exposure to shortterm business cycles, and focus on a smaller number of businesses and market segments that offer true opportunities for synergies. The Plan was developed after an extensive review of all of Nexans’ operations, including an assessment of each business’ growth and profitability potential, business cycle, and competitive positioning. Following this review, the Group divided its operations into three different types of activities: � cables and energy systems for infrastructure, industry, and buildings, which will be at the core of Nexans’ strategy, � telecom cables, a supplemental activity for which Nexans will use a more selective sales approach, ----- � electrical wires, an upstream activity for which Nexans intends to gradually rationalize operations so that it eventually serves only the Group's needs. By the end of the 2007-2009 Strategic Plan, Nexans aims to be a global player in the infrastructure, energy, and industrial sectors with a solid position in domestic building markets. - The infrastructure market has a very positive outlook for the coming years. The trend in this market is towards sustained, broad-based growth fuelled by new energy infrastructure being built in emerging markets, as well as maintenance and upgrades in developed markets. - The industry market is dependent on the global economy and stands to benefit from heavy investments in petrochemicals and transport. - The building market is buoyant in Europe, although it has experienced a temporary downturn in North America. In rapidly-developing countries, it serves as a development basis for the Group’s growth. The Group intends to bolster its positions in these strategic sectors through: - an enhanced product mix, - expansion into new, profitable geographic markets, - a stronger customer focus, achieved in part by setting up a new sales organization and a technical support department serving the industrial sector, which will be divided into eight priority market segments (shipbuilding, robotics, nuclear, oil and gas and petrochemicals, material handling, electronics, automotive, and railway). In the telecom business, Nexans plans to use a targeted business development strategy. In relation to telecom infrastructures, this strategy will involve concentrating on promoting copper cables with superior performance for use in XDSL applications, and optical fiber cable systems for use in FTTH deployment. Nexans plans to leverage its small size and niche positioning in several of these markets. Regarding LAN applications, the Group’s ability to exploit synergies is limited by the need to implement a regional approach for selling these products. Furthermore, there is a growing risk that the copper-based portion of this market will become commoditized. At the same time, Nexans plans to gradually scale back its operations in electrical wires and wirerods so that these businesses eventually serve only to supply the Group’s internal requirements. This regional and business reorganization will require considerable resources, particularly in terms of capital expenditure. The Group plans to invest an estimated amount of over 500 million euros between 2007 and 2009, with the three priority areas of energy infrastructure, industry, and buildings accounting for over 80% of this total. Nexans has set the following targets in its 2007-2009 Strategic Plan (calculated on a like-for-like basis) which it intends to achieve through a focus on high value-added products, targeted efforts towards the industrial sector, and continued restructuring initiatives (representing 30 million euros per year): - Consolidated sales of approximately 5,000 million euros (at constant metal prices), with average annual organic growth of 6% (excluding the scaled-back operations in the electrical wires and wirerod businesses); - Operating margin of 7.5%; - Pre-tax ROCE of around 13%; - Neutral cash flow[(19)] in 2007, and positive cash flow in 2008 and 2009. The forward-looking information given above is based on the following assumptions: � Standard copper and aluminum prices of 1,500 euros per ton and 1,200 euros per ton, respectively. � A copper price of 4,400 euros per ton over the entire 2007-2009 period for ROCE and cash flow calculations. (19) After changes in working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and dividends. ----- � Constant exchange rates (euro against other currencies), using the rates in effect at year-end 2006. � The same global economic climate as seen over the past few years, with a moderate slowdown in growth in the US relative to Europe. � An annual growth rate of approximately 3% for the global cable market between 2007 and 2009 (at constant copper prices). � Continued growth in the infrastructure, transport, and petrochemicals markets.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

Nexans’ policies for managing interest rate risk, exchange rate risk, and non-ferrous metal price risk are set and overseen by its Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department, and implemented by its operating subsidiaries. Risk management for Nexans’ subsidiaries is managed by the Treasury and Non-Ferrous Metals Department, whenever this practice is allowed by the legislation in the country where the subsidiary is located. Countries that do not allow such centralized risk management include Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Morocco, China, Korea, Vietnam, and Brazil.

Liquidity risks,3336.33.1,,"During the first half of 2006, the Group met its liquidity needs primarily through the issuance of commercial paper on the French market and the proceeds of a convertible bond issued by the Group in July 2004 in the amount of 135 million euros. ----- However, in June 2006 three events changed the Group’s access to liquidity. First, the Group obtained and exercised the right to call the aforementioned convertible bonds early, which resulted in a 117 million euros increase in equity and a reduction in its cash needs. Second, the Group carried out a successful new convertible bond issue for 280 million euros in early July 2006, which improved its financial flexibility. Third, Standard & Poor’s changed Nexans’ debt rating from BBB-/negative/A3 to BB+/stable/B, which restricted the Group’s access to short-term commercial paper. Therefore in the second half of 2006, Nexans covered its short-term cash needs through non-confirmed bank lines of credit and by drawing down a portion of its confirmed medium-term credit facility in order to finance the Olex acquisition at the end of November. In order to manage its medium-term financing needs, Nexans obtained an extension of the expiry date for its confirmed medium-term credit facility as well as an increase in the syndicated loan that had previously been arranged with a group of banks. The amount available under this syndicated loan was increased from 450 million euros to 580 million euros, with no change to the loan terms. The loan has a duration of five years starting from October 2006, and is subject to the customary loan covenants (e.g., a negative pledge, _pari passu, and cross default) and consolidated financial ratios (net debt/EBITDA < 2.95 and net debt/total equity < 1.15). Nexans was in full compliance with these ratios at December 31, 2006 and at the date that this report was prepared. A breach of any of the loan covenants would freeze any undrawn lines and accelerate the due date of any amounts outstanding, either immediately or after a period of thirty days depending upon the nature of the covenant. At December 31, 2006, the Group’s gross debt was 919 million euros. Out of this total, commercial paper represented 43 million euros bank borrowings 506 million euros, sales of trade receivables 124 million euros, and the July 2006 convertible bond issue 246 million euros. The conversion option related to these bonds is recognized in equity in the amount of 34 million euros. At the same date, the Group had 287 million euros of cash and cash equivalents in the form of demand deposits, term deposits, and short-term negotiable instruments. The Group’s 120 million euros receivables assignment program for the sales of receivables related to its main French operating subsidiaries (Nexans France, Société de Coulée Continue de Cuivre, and Société Lensoise du Cuivre), negotiated in December 2003, was used fully during most of 2006. This program was increased to 150 million euros upon renegotiation in December 2006, although the terms remained the same. Certain Nexans subsidiaries outside France also sell receivables to cover some of their working capital requirements whenever this type of financing is competitive. ----- _Amounts in millions of euros_",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

Customer credit risks,3336.35.1,,"Nexans’ credit risk is limited by the Group-wide protection represented by the diversification of its businesses, its customers and its geographic base. With respect to Nexans’ internal practices to reduce customer credit risk, for certain major export markets the Group implements secured payment methods including down payments on orders, progress payments, and irrevocable letters of credit confirmed by banks approved by the Treasury Department. For its other markets Nexans has set up an insurance program relating to the risk of nonrecovery of customer receivables through a short-term credit insurance policy for sales in local and export markets. This credit insurance policy – which has been taken out with the specialist international insurer, Coface – covers companies representing approximately 80% of the Group’s sales. By agreement with the insurer, certain customers representing a very low risk of default over the short term are excluded from the credit insurance policy. As part of its insurance coverage, Coface provides Nexans with access to a database concerning the credit risk associated with each customer. This enables each unit to manage its risk by monitoring customer outstandings against the insurance credit limits, and in the event of default, to limit the impact on its cash position and income to any amount over the coverage limit and the policy deductible (generally 10% of the insured amount). Outstandings in excess of the amounts covered by the credit insurance policy are subject to periodic review by the Country Managers and their financial controllers. |Securities issued or loans taken out Bank overdrafts|Amount drawn down at December 31, 2006 34|Fixed or floating rate Floating rate|Global amount|Residual maturity of the lines drawn down Overnight|Hedged or unhedged Unhedged| |---|---|---|---|---|---| |Commercial paper|43|Floating rate|500|1 month to 1 year|Unhedged| |Short-term borrowings|135|Floating rate|500|1 month to 1 year|Unhedged| |Confirmed lines|330|Floating rate|580|4.8 years|Unhedged| |Sales of receivables|124|Floating rate|180|1 year|Unhedged| |Medium-term borrowings|7|Fixed rate|2|3 to 5 years|Unhedged| |Convertible bond|246|Fixed rate|246|6.5 years|Unhedged| ----- Gross trade receivables 1,313 1,147 879 749 Provisions (41) (42) (43) (43) Net amount 1,272 1,105 836 706 Provisions as a percentage - 3.1% - 3.7% - 4.9% - 5.7% The level of provisions in 2006 was on a par with 2005, reflecting the fact that default risk on the Group's trade receivables remained at a stable level.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

This scoring grid changes each year in accordance with regulatory developments and those areas which the Group wishes to improve. In 2006, the points reviewed included water recycling at the plants in order to limit consumption, waste recycling and reuse, the identification of major environmental risks (accompanied by specific crisis management plans), and the storage of hazardous liquids. A Group environmental manual, approved by the Executive Committee, has been drawn up and sent to all production sites, describing the procedures applied by Nexans Environmental Management system. This manual serves as a reference document both for existing Environmental Management systems and for those yet to be installed in the Group's plants. It describes the Group’s organization and the role of Country Management in the implementation of the Group’s Environmental Policy.

The additional staff numbers in North America are primarily due to growth in specialty products and truck harness manufacturing operations in Mexico.

Nexans was formed on January 7, 1994 (under the name Atalec). Its headquarters are at 16, rue de Monceau, 75008 Paris, and it is listed on the Paris stock exchange (compartment A of Euronext Paris). The consolidated financial statements are presented in euros rounded to the nearest million. These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on January 30, 2007 and will become final upon approval by the General Shareholders’ Meeting, which will take place on May 10, 2007. The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. Except where otherwise indicated, these policies have been applied consistently to all the financial years presented. � **Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Nexans Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union. The historical cost convention has been applied, except for derivatives and available-for-sale financial assets, which are measured at fair value. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair value risk is hedged have been adjusted to take into account fluctuations in fair value attributable to the hedged risks. `o` **Amendments to published standards effective in 2006 � IAS 19 (amendment), Employee Benefits, whose application is mandatory for all financial periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006. The updated standard introduces the option of an alternative recognition approach for actuarial gains and losses. It may impose additional requirements regarding the recognition of multi-employer plans if there is insufficient information to apply defined benefit accounting. It also adds new disclosure requirements. The Group is not currently planning to change the accounting method for the recognition of actuarial gains and losses and does not participate in any multi-employer plans; the adoption of this amendment thus only affects the format and scope of the disclosures presented in the financial statements. � IAS 39 (amendment): cash flow hedges of forecast intra-group transactions. `o` **Standards adopted early by the Group � IAS 1 (amendment): Presentation of Financial Statements – Capital Disclosures (applicable to financial years beginning on or after January 1, 2007). `o` **Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2006 but not applicable to the",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

IFRIC 8 states that IFRS 2 applies to any transaction in which an entity receives goods or services as consideration for the issue of equity instruments of the entity as well as transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities, in respect of goods or services received, that are based on the price (or value) of the entity’s shares or other equity instruments. This includes transactions in which the entity cannot specifically identify some or all of the goods received, in which case the unidentifiable goods or services must be measured at the grant date. Such is the case when the identifiable consideration received by the entity appears to be less than the fair value of the equity instruments granted or liability incurred. The Group, which will apply IFRIC 8 from January 1, 2007, does not anticipate that this standard will have any impact on its consolidated financial statements. � IFRIC 10: Interim Financial Reporting and impairment (applicable to financial years beginning on or after November 1, 2006).

IFRIC 7 does not apply to the Group’s business activities as no Group entity has a currency of a hyperinflationary currency as its functional currency. � IFRIC 9: Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives (applicable to financial years beginning on or after June 1, 2006). IFRIC 9 requires an entity to assess whether an embedded derivative should be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity becomes party to the contract. Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change to the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise have been required under the contract, in which case reassessment is required. IFRIC 9 does not apply to the Group’s business activities as no entity has changed the terms of the contracts to which it is party. � **Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires Management to exercise its judgment and make estimates and assumptions that impact the application of the accounting policies and the amounts of (i) assets (impairment of goodwill, property plant and equipment and intangible assets; recognition of deferred tax assets; valuation of margins on construction contracts), (ii) liabilities (provisions and pension obligations), and (iii) income and expenses. The estimates and underlying assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered reasonable under the circumstances. They serve as the basis for any judgment required for determining the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities when such amounts cannot be obtained directly from other sources. Actual amounts may differ from these estimates. The critical judgments made by Management in applying the Group's accounting policies within the consolidated financial statements are listed below, together with the key sources of estimation uncertainty. They are expanded upon in the notes pertaining to the specific items. In 2006, Management reviewed its estimates relating to: - The recoverable amount of certain items of property, plant and equipment (in particular following the change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories which resulted in an increase in capital employed (see Note 1.b)); - Deferred tax assets not previously recognized relating to unused tax loss carry forwards (see Note 9); - The recoverable amount of goodwill (see Note 11); ----- - The measurement of pension liabilities and other employee benefits (see Note 20); - Provisions and contingent liabilities (see Note 28). The impact of changes in accounting estimates is recognized over the period of the change if it only affects that period or over the period of the change and subsequent periods if they are also affected by the change. Judgments made by Management and estimates presenting a significant risk of change over the subsequent period are presented in the relevant notes.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3337,2006 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,3337.29,b.** **Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories,3337.29.1,,"Following the application of IFRS from January 1, 2004, Nexans included non-ferrous metal inventories, referred to as core exposure, in property, plant and equipment. This asset represents the amounts required for the Group’s plants to operate appropriately. Its volume is kept stable and its levels are constantly replenished. For this reason, it is not hedged by forward sales contracts. As an item of property, plant and equipment, it was stated at historical cost at January 1, 2004 and was not depreciated as its residual value was greater than its carrying amount and due to its indefinite useful life. Non-ferrous metal inventories other than those representing the core exposure were recognized in inventory and measured at purchase cost using the weighted average cost method. The accounting policy applied is described on page 10 of the document entitled Transition to IFRS, which accompanied the 2004 Annual Report. When drawing up the 2006 consolidated financial statements, Nexans decided to reclassify as inventory the amounts previously recognized under property, plant and equipment. As a result, these amounts are now measured using the weighted average cost method. For the purposes of comparison, the 2004 and 2005 financial statements have been restated in line with this new approach. The policy adopted at transition to IFRS of recognizing core exposure as an item of property, plant and equipment was designed to neutralize in the income statement the impact on core exposure of changes in metal prices, in line with the Group’s metal risk management policy. Prior to the switch over to IFRS, the Nexans Group used the LIFO method. The change now introduced by Nexans (use of the weighted average cost method in the same way as for other inventory) stems from a review of IFRS applicable to this particular case, which other European Groups faced with the same issue have also undertaken. Given the very significant rises in non-ferrous metal prices over the past three years, the new approach will better reflect the value of inventory in the balance sheet. Against a background of rising non-ferrous metal prices, the revaluation of the core exposure resulting from the use of the weighted average cost method gave rise to an increase in the working capital requirement included in non-monetary assets which are subject to impairment tests whenever there is an indication that they may be impaired. This led to an increase in the amount of impairment recognized in respect of certain cash generating units at December 31, 2005. In sum, the new core exposure accounting treatment has given rise to the following restatements of consolidated equity at January 1, 2004, December 31, 2004 and 2005, as well as consolidated income for 2004 and 2005: ----- Core exposure revaluation Deferred |in millions of euros|Reported|exposure Additional tax|Restated| |---|---|---|---| ||amounts|revaluation impairment impact|amounts| |Consolidated equity at January 1, 2004 952 33 - (4) 981|||| |December 31, 2004 (prior to IAS 32-39)   December 31, 2004 (after IAS 32-39)|970   986|76  - (13)   76  - (13)|1,033  1,049| |---|---|---|---| |December 31, 2005|1,160|169 (28) (23)|1,278| |Consolidated net income 2004:|||| |Consolidated net income 2004:    Attributable to equity holders of the parent company|58|43  - (9)|92| |---|---|---|---| |Attributable to minority interests|5|- - -|5| |Total|63|43 - (9)|97| ||||| |Consolidated net income 2005:|||-| Attributable to minority interests 9 0   - (0) 9 Total 117 93 (28) (10) 172 The other changes to the 2004 and 2005 financial statements are set out in additional tables in Notes 7, 9, 11, 12 and 15.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

This led to an increase in the amount of impairment recognized in respect of certain cash generating units at December 31, 2005. Impairment losses recorded in 2005 related primarily to the special cables for electronic applications business in Belgium, the industrial cable business in Switzerland and Belgium, the private network cable business in the United Kingdom and the telecom infrastructure cable business in Spain. Reversals of impairment losses related to the general market business in France, the telecom infrastructure cable business in Morocco and the metallurgy business in China. In the restated 2005 financial statements, additional impairment losses were recognized in respect of the special cables for electronic applications business in France and Brazil, the special cables business in Germany and Switzerland and certain support assets in Germany. The Group also recognized goodwill impairment in relation to Nexans Inc and Nexans Brazil (see Note 11). The 109 million euros in impairment losses for 2006 primarily relate to the Group’s upstream businesses (wirerods, electrical wires and the remainder of the winding wires business in Canada and China) where capital employed was particularly impacted by the rise in raw material prices. They also concern the energy infrastructure cable businesses in Germany, Italy, Greece, Egypt and South Korea. These changes led to the recognition of impairment losses of 19 million euros relating to the goodwill of Liban Câbles, ICC (Egypt), Nexans Tianjin and Nexans Inc. Conversely, the turnaround in the industrial cables business in Switzerland and Germany, the special cables for electronic applications business in France and Turkey and the building cables business in the United States enabled the Group to reverse 27 million euros worth of impairment losses. |in millions of euros|2006|2005 2004 Restated Reported Restated Reported| |---|---|---| |Impairment losses – non-current assets|(109)|(49) (14) - -| |Reversals of impairment losses – non-current assets|27|21 8 - -| |Impairment losses – goodwill|(19)|(6) - - -| |Negative goodwill recognized in the income statement|2|2 2 7 7| |Net asset impairment and negative goodwill|(99)|(32) (4) 7 7| ----- The main assumptions applied by geographical area when preparing the business plans in connection with impairment testing were as follows: Discount rate (before Discount rate (after tax) applied to future tax) applied to future Perpetuity growth rate flows flows **2006** Europe 10.6% 8.0% 2% North America 11.9% 9.0% 2% China 11.9% 10.0% 2% Korea 10.2% 8.0% 2% Egypt 14.4% 12.0% 2% Brazil 15.2% 11.0% 2% Turkey 16.7% 12.0% 2% Lebanon 17.8% 15.5% 2% **2005** Europe 10.2% 7.7% 2% North America 10.2% 7.7% 2% China 10.5% 8.8% 2% Korea 11.4% 8.9% 2% Egypt 11.1% 9.2% 2% Brazil 17.6% 12.8% 2% Turkey 20.7% 14.8% 2% Lebanon 18.5% 16.1% 2%",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

Where this happens, these positions are limited in terms of the amounts and periods involved. At the balance sheet date, Nexans had no material unhedged foreign exchange positions. Exchange rate risk is identified at the level of the Group’s operating subsidiaries. The treasurers of the subsidiaries hedge the risk by executing forward exchange rate transactions, with Group Treasury for the centralized subsidiaries, or with their local banks for the other subsidiaries. The table below, which shows the foreign exchange risk of Nexans’ Central Treasury, includes all forward currency transactions that had not expired at December 31, 2006.

While the hedging of risks relating to definite flows eliminates foreign exchange risk, the hedging of risks relating to estimated flows is by its nature imperfect because the hedged flow may not arise or may differ from the estimated amount. A program of controls by Central Treasury in the subsidiaries enables regular checks to be carried out to ensure that the procedures have been properly understood and implemented. Lastly, during its visits to the Group’s subsidiaries, internal audit systematically reviews the application of the procedures relating to the identification and hedging of foreign exchange risks. Some bids are made in currencies other than that in which the entity operates. The foreign exchange risk relating to these bids is not systematically hedged, which can give rise to a cost for the Group should there be a change between the time the bid is made and its acceptance by the customer. -----",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3337,2006 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,3337.199,c)** **Metal price risk,3337.199.1,,"Although copper and aluminum prices are particularly volatile, Nexans believes that its operating margin is only slightly exposed to these changes in prices, due to the dual effect of passing on any rise in non-ferrous metal prices to customers and the implementation of forward hedges on the regulated metals markets. To offset the risks stemming from the volatility of non-ferrous metal prices (copper and aluminum), Nexans firstly passes on the metal prices on the day of the order in its pricing and secondly carries out an actual hedge at the same price or via hedges on the LME: with regard to this twin mechanism, Nexans does not make any income of a speculative nature on metals, which is what the operating margin measures, a sign of the cash flow neutrality of this hedging mechanism. In order for the mechanism to work properly, the units must thus have a permanent metal inventory – its own inventory referred to as core exposure. This core exposure represents the minimum amounts that are necessary for the production units to operate appropriately and is not intended to be sold off. As a result, it is not hedged. The decision to reclassify this non-current asset recognized at historic cost in inventory and recognize it at its weighted average cost (see Note 1.b) means that the value of the core exposure will now be exposed to fluctuations in copper and aluminum prices. This accounting and non-cash impact is recorded below operating margin. The net impact on operating income will be limited given the presence of the “natural” hedging mechanism via impairment, in line with the mechanism described in Note 1.b. Nexans’ margins may be exposed to changes in copper prices in some product lines, such as copper cables for cabling systems and building market products. In these markets, any increases are generally passed on in the selling price, but with a time lag that can place a certain amount of pressure on margins. The keen competition in these markets can also affect the timescale within which the increase is passed on. As with foreign exchange risk, the risk of fluctuations in copper and other metal prices is not systematically hedged when making bids. However, fluctuations in copper and aluminum prices have a significant impact in terms of financing needs, since a rise in copper prices implies an increase in working capital requirement. Prices have fluctuated significantly over the past five years. In 2006, copper prices increased very sharply over the first few months of the year, rising from USD 4,537 at the start of January to USD 8,788, a historic high, on May 12, representing an increase of over 93% in less than five months. In the second half of the year, copper prices fell, ending the year at USD 6,290, representing an increase of some 39% over the full year. In euro terms, the rise was limited to 25% over the year when account is taken of the fall in the dollar against the euro between the start and end of the year, but from January to May the increase in euro terms nevertheless amounted to 78%. This increase generated an additional financing need of some 270 million euros for the Group. Finally, despite its stringent criteria for selecting partners with which it works on the LME, and the prudential rules to which these partners are subject, Nexans may be exposed to counterparty risk in the context of forward contracts entered into on the LME.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

Kvaerner is seeking NOK 310 million (around 39 million euros) in damages. Nexans is contesting the application of the patent to its products and manufacturing processes and has itself launched proceedings in Norway and the Netherlands to invalidate Kvaerner’s patent. - Certain proceedings launched by the competition authorities. In France, the Direction Nationale des Enquêtes (National Investigation Agency) of the Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (Department of competition, consumer affairs and anti-fraud) started investigations in 2003 and in 2006 into contracts awarded by EDF for the supply of high-voltage cables, and the electrical cables sector. No official notification of complaint has yet been received in these two matters and no provision has been recorded by the Group. However, in view of the limited information available regarding this investigation, Nexans is unable to predict how they may evolve or what impact they may have on its results or operations. In addition, the Bundeskartellamt (German Federal Antitrust Authority) informed Nexans that an investigation it had opened in 2003 regarding practices in the cable industry in Germany had been discontinued. - An issue relating to the cables manufactured by one of the Group’s European subsidiaries and sold to a harness manufacturer. This manufacturer sold them to another equipment manufacturer, which in turn sold them to a European vehicle manufacturer. The subsidiary was not informed of the specifications required by the end customer. The end customer used the cables together with switches notably for use in wipers and a certain number of cables broke. The subsidiary considers that the cables sold met the specifications agreed with its customer, the harness manufacturer. At this stage, the Company has very little information on any problems noted in vehicles on the road or their causes. Its direct client has formally indicated to the subsidiary that it reserves the right to call upon it to join as a third party should it be called upon by its own customer, the equipment manufacturer, without having at the same time set out what the subsidiary’s grounds for liability would be. No legal proceedings have yet been taken. The vehicle manufacturer nevertheless undertook a recall that could affect around 350,000 switches installed to replace the faulty parts.

These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. _1. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements_ We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of the consolidated group of companies for the year then ended, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our opinion expressed above, we draw your attention to Section b, “Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories” of Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements, which describes the Company’s change in accounting for core exposure and its impact on consolidated equity and net income. 162 ----- _2. Justification of our assessments_ In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de _commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring your attention to the following_ matters: _Change relating to the recognition of non-ferrous metal inventories_ As part of our assessment of the Company’s accounting methods, we verified that this change is justified. _Impairment of assets_ During the last quarter of each year, your Company tests goodwill for impairment and also performs a review to determine if there is any indication that non-current assets may be impaired, as described in Section o, “Impairment tests” of Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies” to the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed the methods used to carry out these impairment tests as well as the corresponding cash flow forecasts and assumptions, and we verified that Notes 1.o and 11 to the consolidated financial statements provide appropriate information. _Deferred tax assets_ Your Company recognizes deferred tax assets in its consolidated balance sheet on the basis of business plans, as described in Section w, “Deferred tax,” of Note 1, “Summary of significant accounting policies” and Note 9, “Income tax” to the consolidated financial statements. We assessed the information and assumptions upon which those estimates were based, reviewed the calculations made by the Company and compared the accounting estimates for previous periods with actual figures to ensure that the estimates were consistent with those for the previous period and with those used to test for asset impairment. As part of our assessment, we ensured that those estimates were reasonable. The assessments were made in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. _3. Specific verification_ In accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information provided in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

In June 2006, 3,534,160 of these bonds were converted into shares and the remaining 18,472 bonds were redeemed (see Note 9). In July 2006, Nexans carried out a new convertible bond issue for 280 million euros, comprised of 3,794,037 bonds, each with a nominal value of 73.80 euros, bearing interest of 1.50%. The redemption premium on these bonds amounts to 11.9556 euros per bond. The bonds may be converted into new shares or exchanged for existing shares at any time up to the seventh business day prior to the redemption date, namely in principle, December 23, 2012, on the basis of one Nexans share per bond. In the second half, Nexans also had recourse to unconfirmed credit lines and partially drew down its medium-term confirmed credit facility. At December 31, 2006, Nexans had confirmed medium-term credit lines of 580 million euros, 330 million euros of which had been drawn down. These credit lines are subject to the customary loan covenants (negative surety, pari-passu and cross default) and to covenants in respect of financial ratios (consolidated net debt/EBITDA < 2.95, and consolidated net debt/total equity < 1.15). Nexans was in full compliance with these ratios both at December 31, 2006, and at the date the Board of Directors approved the financial statements. A breach of any of these covenants would freeze any undrawn lines and bring forward the due date of any amounts outstanding, either immediately or after a period of thirty days depending on the nature of the covenant.

These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. _1. Opinion on the financial statements_ We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of the Company for the year then ended, in accordance with the accounting rules and principles applicable in France. _2. Justification of our assessments_ In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de _commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring your attention to the following_ matters: 186 ----- Your Company records a provision for impairment of its investments and loans granted to subsidiaries when their carrying amount, estimated on the basis of their value in use, is lower than their gross value, as described in Note 2.1 to the financial statements. Our work consisted of assessing the data and assumptions on which those estimates were based, reviewing the calculations made by the Company, and reviewing the management’s process for approving those estimates. As part of our assessment, we also ensured that those estimates were reasonable. The assessments were made in the context of our audit of the financial statements taken as a whole and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. _3. Specific verifications and information_ We have also performed the specific verifications required by law in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We have no matters to report regarding: - the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information provided in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. - the fair presentation of the information provided in the management report in respect of remuneration granted to company officers and any other commitments made in their favor in connection with, or subsequent to, their appointment, termination or change in function. In accordance with the law, we have verified that the management report contains the appropriate disclosures as regards the identity of the principal shareholders.

1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3347,INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS,3347.14,OTHER LEGAL INFORMATION Disputes,3347.14.1,,"A certain number of contingencies and disputes exist in relation to the Group’s business but in view of the provisions already recognized and the insurance coverage in place, as well as the likelihood of judgment being entered against Nexans and the amount of the claims concerned, Management believes that they will not have a significant impact on the Group’s earnings. The most significant ongoing dispute for which provisions have been recorded relates to cables supplied by Nexans for corvettes for the South African navy. The supply of certain of these cables was subcontracted to a South African manufacturer. After installation of the cables on the first two corvettes, it was found that the cables supplied by the subcontractor were non-compliant. All the cables already installed were then removed and replaced. The customer is claiming damages of approximately 36 million euros, which Nexans is contesting. The allocation of liability between Nexans and the parties involved – including the customer, the insurers and the subcontractor – has not yet been determined. In view of the general uncertainty as to the liability of each party, in its 2004 financial statements Nexans considered it to be prudent and reasonable to increase the €5 million euro provision already set aside at December 31, 2003. At December 31, 2006 this provision was maintained in the Group’s financial statements. Based on the information available to date and the position of the insurer, the 11 million euro provision currently recorded will probably prove to be unnecessary. No provision has been recognized for the following additional contingences and disputes because the circumstances do not meet the recognition criteria: A claim filed in Norway in March 2005 against Nexans Norway by one of its competitors – Kvaerner – alleging infringement of a patent involving umbilical cables. Kvaerner is claiming NOK 310 million (i.e., approximately 39 million euros) in damages. Nexans believes that the patent is not applicable to its products and manufacturing processes, and has itself started proceedings in Norway and the Netherlands to invalidate Kvaerner’s patent. Proceeding launched by the competition authorities. In France, the Direction Nationale des Enquêtes (National Investigation Agency) of the Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (Department of Competition, Consumer Affairs and Repression of Fraud) started investigations in 2003 and 2006 into contracts awarded by EDF for the supply of highvoltage cables, and into the electric cables sector. Nexans received a statement of complaints following the 2003 investigation, but no indication was given of the fines which could be applied for the alleged wrongdoings. Nexans intends to vigorously contest these complaints. In Germany, the investigation started in 2003 by the Bundeskartellamt (German Competition Authority) into practices in the cable industry has been officially discontinued. A dispute that arose in 2006 concerning cables made by one of Nexans’ European subsidiaries and sold to a cable harness maker, which then sold them to an automobile equipment manufacturer supplying a European vehicle manufacturer (the “end customer”). Nexans’ subsidiary was not informed of the end customer’s technical specifications. The end customer used Nexans’ cables along with switches in its windshield-wipers systems, and some of the cables apparently broke. The subsidiary asserts that the cables were sold according to the specifications given by its customer, the harness maker. At this stage, Nexans has very limited information regarding the problems observed in cars that have been sold, or their causes. Nexans’ direct customer has notified the subsidiary that it reserves the right to join the subsidiary as a third party to the case if a claim is made against it by its customer, the automobile equipment manufacturer, but has not specified on what basis Nexans’ subsidiary could be held liable. No legal action has been taken to date, although the vehicle ----- manufacturer has launched a recall that could involve changing faulty parts in approximately 350,000 switches. Although it is not yet possible to ascertain the impact of these contingencies and disputes, Nexans currently does not believe that they will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, but it is unable to guarantee this. The Group is not aware of any other government, legal, or arbitration proceedings that Management considers may have a significant impact on the Group’s financial position or profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

1511_2,Offerings 2007.md,3347,INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS,3347.16,Material contracts,3347.16.1,,"In the two years immediately preceding the publication of this Prospectus, Nexans entered into two agreements that are outside its normal course of business. First, in 2005, Nexans executed a major transaction with Superior Essex. Nexans executed an agreement with Superior Essex in order to create a European joint venture to combine the two Groups’ winding wires and varnish businesses in Europe and in England, respectively. Superior Essex holds a 60% stake in this joint venture, called Essex Nexans, while Nexans holds a 40% stake. The joint venture was partially financed – in an amount of 11.3 million euros – through a promissory note due in September 2010 issued by Essex Nexans in favor of Nexans. In addition to this 40% stake, Nexans also received a cash payment of approximately 35 million euros as consideration for the assets transferred. The agreement included an earn-out clause providing that a price supplement would be due to Nexans from Superior Essex if Essex Nexans’ 2006 EBITDA exceeded a certain pre-defined level. Because this level was exceeded during the year, Nexans is expecting to receive this price supplement from Superior Essex. Superior Essex and Nexans also signed a shareholder agreement according to which Nexans has a put option entitling it to require Superior Essex to buy its entire stake in Essex Nexans at a price equal to the net value of its contribution plus 40% of (i) Essex Nexans’ accrued net sales (adjusted for certain items as stipulated in the shareholder agreement), and (ii) all post-closing contributions to capital less post-closing distributions. This put option is only exercisable if Essex Nexans’ adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the shareholder agreement) exceeds 14,000,000 euros in 2008, 2009 or 2010. The price due in the event the option is exercised will be payable in cash or in Superior Essex shares, or in a combination thereof, at Superior Essex’s option. Superior Essex has a call option on all of Nexans’ shares in Essex Nexans which may be exercised at any time as from October 21, 2006. The price due in the event that this call option is exercised will be payable in cash. From June 30, 2011, both shareholders may freely dispose of their shares to a third party of their choice, subject to a right of first refusal by the other shareholder. ----- In addition, Essex Nexans has executed agreements with Nexans’ subsidiaries for the supply of wirerods and wires. Under the wirerod contract, Essex Nexans committed to buying a monthly volume of wirerods at a fixed conversion price, which is adjusted annually, plus the cost of copper. According to the provisions of this agreement, Nexans is the exclusive supplier of wirerod in France and the exclusive supplier of a substantial portion of Essex Nexans’ requirements in Germany. Under the wire contract, Essex Nexans committed to buying a substantial portion of wire requirements from Nexans’ subsidiaries at a fixed conversion price, which is adjusted annually, plus the cost of copper. According to the provisions of these agreements, Nexans is the exclusive supplier of wire for all Essex Nexans’ requirements in France and Germany and 30% of its requirements in Portugal. These agreements expire on December 31, 2008, and are renewed automatically each year, unless either of the parties terminate them, giving twelve months’ notice. Second, Nexans signed an agreement with Viscas Corporation in Japan in order to form a joint venture for manufacturing high-voltage cables. Cables made by the new company, named Nippon HighVoltage Cable Corporation, or NVC, will be sold only to its direct or indirect shareholders. NVC will not sell to other parties nor carry out any other commercial activities. NVC is 66%-owned by Nexans Participations and 34% by Viscas. NVC purchased the equipment and machines necessary for its operations from Viscas, and is leasing its plant from Viscas. Neither party may sell its shares in NVC without prior approval from the other party. However, under certain circumstances, Viscas will be entitled, or even required, to sell all its NVC shares to Nexans at a price corresponding to the shares’ percentage of NVC’s net asset value. These circumstances include a refusal by Viscas to provide additional financing to NVC in a cumulative amount exceeding 3,420 million yen; failure to comply with an essential clause of the agreement; and expiration of the agreement. Nexans is not aware of any other contract (other than the contracts entered into in the normal course of business) executed by any member of the Group that include provisions imposing upon any member of the Group a significant obligation or commitment for the entire Group.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

On March 16, 2005, Alcatel sold its remaining stake in Nexans’ capital. In addition to the industrial and trade relations now existing between the two groups (non-material as a percentage of Nexans’ total business), two items are particularly noteworthy: Following the incorporation of the Nexans Group, under an agreement dated December 1, 2000, Alcatel granted Nexans a non-exclusive, royalty-free license, with the possibility of granting sublicenses, to use the patents on the cables related to Alcatel’s business which were required for Nexans to operate its business. Under this agreement, Alcatel also granted Nexans a non-exclusive, royaltyfree license, without the possibility of granting sub-licenses, to use monomode optical fiber patents related only to manufactured products and manufacturing processes used by Nexans prior to January 1, 2001 at certain of its designated sites remaining within Nexans’ scope of consolidation but pertaining to Alcatel’s business. Conversely, Nexans granted Alcatel similar rights to Nexans patents. The parties are not responsible for either guaranteeing the validity or the extent of the rights granted under license, or for protecting the rights covered by the patents in the event of violation or infringement by a third party. This agreement was executed for a term equivalent to the term of the protection of the rights covered by the agreement. ----- In the context of the incorporation of the Nexans Group, Nexans and certain of its subsidiaries in Germany, Spain, and Canada, decided to spin-off and subsequently transfer to Alcatel businesses related to Alcatel’s activities. Conversely, in France and the United States, Alcatel and certain subsidiaries spun off then transferred to Nexans certain businesses related to Nexans’ activities. Alcatel and Nexans then agreed to hold each other harmless from any liabilities arising at their subsidiaries in connection with any business they no longer own.

These amounts broke down as follows: By business segment: Energy (80%), Telecom (10%), Electrical wires (8%) and Other (2%), By geographical area: Europe (66%), North America (14%), Asia-Pacific (3%), Rest of the World (17%). 2006 was marked by a significant increase in capital spending related to major projects started in 2005: In Europe, investments were focused primarily on growing business in the priority segments outlined in the company’s strategic plan. These investments included capacity increases for high-voltage cable manufacturing, as well as enhanced production and technical facilities in the automotive sector. Nexans also pursued its efforts to cut costs and boost manufacturing productivity, particularly to meet the robust demand for medium-voltage cables. In North America, investments were made to complete the capacity expansion project for US building cables. Nexans also continued to update the technology of its aeronautical cable manufacturing equipment, and increase its capacity for high-end LAN cable production. In Asia, investments centered around the LAN production capacity increase in China and making further progress on the 2005 automobile cable project in Korea. In the Rest of the World, the automobile cable development project continued in Morocco while power cable production capacity was increased at the Lorena site in Brazil. Substantial investments were also made in Egypt, to improve manufacturing efficiency, and at the Tuzla plant in Turkey, to shift production towards LAN cables and instrumentation cables for the oil sector. In order to support its expansion into high-growth markets, Nexans formed a joint venture (in which it has a 66% stake) to acquire a new plant in Japan for producing high-voltage subsea cables. Furthermore, the Group’s regional and business reorganization will require considerable resources, particularly in terms of capital expenditure. These investments are expected to exceed 500 million euros over the 2007-2009 period, with over 80% allocated to the three priority segments of energy infrastructure, buildings, and industry.",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

This certification was renewed by the IFACI in July 2006 after a follow-up audit. Although organizationally it reports to the Finance Department, functionally the Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Chairman and CEO. Its work is approved and monitored by the Accounts and Audit Committee. The Internal Audit Department helps the Group to attain its objectives by systematically and methodically assessing the suitability of management processes in terms of risks, control, and corporate governance, monitoring these processes and making recommendations to strengthen them. The Group has also set up an audit charter – approved by the Accounts and Audit Committee in 2005 – which sets out the responsibilities of the Internal Audit Department. The ongoing responsibilities of the Internal Audit Department, covering financial and administrative as well as operational matters, are as follows: - identify, analyze and measure risks, - ensure that internal control mechanisms are in place and functioning, and ensure compliance with internal control procedures, - conduct internal financial audits, - conduct operational audits in cooperation with the departments concerned, - propose corrective actions and methods of implementation, - identify and promote best practices. To achieve these goals, the Internal Audit Department conducts audits to verify that the measures that have been implemented are appropriate and are effective for the Group’s potential risks. A risk mapping process was launched in 2002, carried out jointly by the Internal Audit Department and an external consulting firm. The aim of this process was to identify risks and areas of risk including all risks identified by management as well as their concerns with respect to controls, and to evaluate their impact on the Nexans Group’s financial condition and earnings. The risk map is updated every year, focusing in particular on controlling and monitoring issues identified as sensitive, as well as following up on recommendations made in the context of internal audits. Risks were identified through interviews with Executive Committee members, the Managers of Corporate Functions, Product Line Managers and Country Managers. ----- Risks were evaluated according to the frequency with which they are likely to occur and the gravity of the consequences that may result from the occurrence of the risk. The level of risk was evaluated and rated before and after application of existing internal control procedures An audit plan was drawn up on the basis of the risk map, covering a broad spectrum of issues, including: - Cash management and exchange rate risks, - Non-ferrous metal hedging risk, - Purchasing process, - Inventories process, - Sales process, - Management of major turnkey projects, - Legal, insurance, safety and environmental issues, - Information systems, - Human resources. The Executive and Accounts and Audit Committees review and update this audit plan annually. After each audit is conducted, the Internal Audit Department issues a report that contains recommendations which are subject to a formal monitoring procedure. Each report is sent to the Chairman and CEO, the Chief Operating Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the appropriate member(s) of the Executive Committee, the Head of the Risk Management Department and the entity audited and relevant functional managers. In addition, an annual report on the work carried out by the Internal Audit Department is submitted to the Board of Directors, the Accounts and Audit Committee and the Executive Committee.

French GAAP were applied by Nexans through December 31, 2004, and IFRS have been applied since 2005, pursuant to EC regulation 1606/2002 (the 2004 financial statements have been restated according to IAS/IFRS to facilitate year-on-year comparisons). The breakdown by business segment and product line is based on the legal entities’ financial statements. These statements are prepared according to standard accounting principles defined in numerous procedures. In particular, to ensure the consistency of the information produced, Nexans has an accounting manual which is used by all Group units and defines each line in the operating income statement analyzed by function for the unit as a whole and for their product lines. - **The process In the final quarter of each year, a budget is prepared by the units for each product line. The budget is discussed by the Local and Area Management and is submitted to Nexans’ executive management team for final approval. The Group’s budget is submitted to the Board of Directors. It is then included in a monthly report. Each month, the units prepare a report broken down by product line, the results of which are analyzed by Management as part of the business review. The figures are compared with the budget and with the previous year’s results. The consolidated results by area and by product line are analyzed by Nexans’ executive management team at an Area meeting. A consolidated accounts closing procedure is carried out on a quarterly basis, with a specific procedure applicable at the year-end. This specific year-end procedure involves Balance Sheet Committee meetings which are attended by Country managers and where key decisions are made relating to the year-end accounts closing.

The most significant ongoing dispute for which provisions have been recorded relates to cables supplied by Nexans for corvettes for the South African navy. The supply of certain of these cables was subcontracted to a South African manufacturer. After installation of the cables on the first two corvettes, it was found that the cables supplied by the subcontractor were noncompliant. All the cables already installed were then removed and replaced. The customer has claimed damages of approximately 36 million euros, which Nexans is contesting. The allocation of liability between Nexans and the parties involved – including the customer, the insurers and the subcontractor – has not yet been determined. In view of the general uncertainty as to the liability of each party, Nexans considered it to be prudent and reasonable in its 2004 financial statements to increase the 5 million euro provision already set aside at December 31, 2003.

Based on the information available and the position of the insurer, the 11 million euro provision currently recorded in the accounts will probably prove to be unnecessary. 2. In the proceedings started by the competition authorities in France, the Direction Nationale des _Enquêtes (National Investigation Agency) of the_ _Direction Générale de la Concurrence, de la Consommation et de la Répression des Fraudes (Department of Competition, Consumer Affairs_ and Repression of Fraud) started investigations in both 2003 and 2006, into certain contracts awarded by EDF for the supply of high voltage cables, and the market for electric cables respectively. Nexans received a statement of complaint from the French Competition Council (""Conseil de la Concurrence"") further to the 2003 investigation, but no indication was given of the fines which may be applied for the alleged wrongdoings. Following receipt of the statement, Nexans France has agreed with the executive case officer of the French Competition Council on a settlement procedure. No provision has been recorded for this case as the circumstances do not meet the required recognition criteria. In light of the specific circumstances of the case, Nexans believes the outcome of this procedure will not have a significant impact on the Group’s net financial situation. Finally, the statement of complaint confirms that the 2006 investigation has been closed. -----",N/A,as_expected,2007,230

On 3 June 2003, the European Council of Economic and Finance Ministers adopted the Directive 2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income in the form of interest payments (the ""Directive""). The Directive requires Member States as from 1 July 2005 to provide to the tax authorities of the other relevant Member State, inter alia, details of payments of interest and other similar income within the meaning of the Directive made by a paying agent within its jurisdiction to (or under certain circumstances for the benefit of) an individual resident in another Member State (the “Disclosure of Information Method”). However, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria, instead of using the Disclosure of Information Method, impose a withholding system for a transitional period unless the beneficiary of interest payment elects for the Disclosure of Information Method or for the tax certificate procedure, as applicable. The rate of such withholding tax equals 15% during the first three years of the transitional period, 20% during the subsequent three years and 35 % until the end of the transitional period. Such transitional period will end at the close of the first full fiscal year following the later of (i) the date of entry into force of an agreement between the European Community, following a unanimous decision of the European Council, and the last of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, San Marino, Monaco and Andorra, providing for the exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model Agreement on Exchange of Information on Tax Matters released on 18 April 2002 (the “OECD Model Agreement”) with respect to interest payments within the meaning of the Savings Directive, in addition to the simultaneous application by those same countries of a withholding tax on such payments at the rate applicable for the corresponding periods mentioned above and (ii) the date on which the European Council unanimously agrees that the United States of America is committed to exchange of information upon request as defined in the OECD Model Agreement with respect to interest payments within the meaning of the Savings Directive. A number of non-EU countries and dependent or associated territories have agreed to adopt similar measures (transitional withholding or exchange of information) with effect since 1 July 2005. If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system and an amount of, or in respect of tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Issuer nor any Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay ----- additional amounts with respect to any Note as a result of the imposition of such withholding tax. If a withholding tax is imposed on payment made by a Paying Agent, the Issuer will be required to maintain a Paying Agent in a Member State that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the Directive. Each Noteholder shall be responsible for supplying, in a timely manner, any information as may be required by the latter in order for it to comply with the identification and reporting obligations imposed on it by the European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any European Directive implementing the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council Meeting of 26-27 November 2000 on the taxation of savings income or any law implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to such Directive. The Directive has been implemented in French law by Article 242 ter of the French _Code _Général des Impôts and Articles 49 I ter to 49 I sexies of the Schedule III to the French_ _Code Général des Impôts. Article 242 ter of the French Code Général des Impôts, imposes on paying_ agents based in France an obligation to report to the French tax authorities certain information with respect to interest payments made to beneficial owners domiciled in another Member State, including, among other things, the identity and address of the beneficial owner and a detailed list of the different categories of interest paid to that beneficial owner. The Directive has been implemented in Luxembourg law by Act of 21 June 2005. -----",N/A,as_expected,2007,230
