For financial reporting purposes, Parent defines its operating segments as Home Care and Care Coordination, which includes the Care Coordination Group. Corporate operating expenses are unallocated to these operating segments. The Care Coordination operating segment is presented as “Other” in the notes to the financial statements of Parent and contains the financial results of the Care Coordination Group. From time to time there are intercompany receivables or payables between the Home Care and Care Coordination segments that are eliminated in consolidation. The financial results of the Issuer are represented in their entirety by the financial results of the Home Care operating segment and the unallocated corporate costs. This offering memorandum does not contain any financial statements of the Issuer for any period. The consolidated financial statements of Parent and its subsidiaries and the corresponding financial information presented in this offering memorandum includes the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Care Coordination Group. We launched the Care Coordination business in 2021 and began limited revenue generating operations in 2022. The Care Coordination business has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues as of the date of this offering memorandum, and the Care Coordination Group will not guarantee or provide collateral support for the notes offered hereby. Certain of the key performance indicators presented in this offering memorandum, including client census, caregiver census and total hours, are metrics that pertain only to the Home Care segment and do not include the Care Coordination Group. In addition, certain non-GAAP financial measures presented in this offering memorandum, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, include adjustments that effectively exclude the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Care Coordination Group for the corresponding periods. For additional information about the differences between the financial information of Parent and that of the Issuer, see the supplemental consolidating information in the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we completed (i) the acquisition of substantially all of the assets related to or used in connection with the operations of Family Home Service, Inc. (“Family Home Service”) for a total purchase price of $3.6 million (the “Family Home Service Acquisition”) and (ii) the acquisition of substantially all of the assets related to or used in connection with the operations of Affordable Home Care LLC (“Affordable”) for a total purchase price of $57.8 million (the “Affordable Acquisition”). The results of these acquisitions are not reflected in our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, in September 2023, we completed the acquisition of certain assets related to and used in connection with the operations of Recco Home Care Service, Inc. (“Recco”) for a total purchase price of $39.0 million (the “Recco Acquisition”). For more information on our acquisitions, see Note 5 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. In addition, since June 30, 2024, we have completed two acquisitions for aggregate cash consideration of $1.5 million. See “Summary—Recent Developments.” This offering memorandum does not present any standalone financial statements for Family Home Service, Affordable, Recco or the two acquisitions we completed since June 30, 2024, and no pro forma financial information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is included herein. In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial information, including certain non-GAAP financial measures, that make adjustments for acquisitions. For example, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA includes an adjustment to give effect to net income associated with completed acquisitions as if each such acquisition had occurred on the first day of the period presented. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information” and “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Such financial information is based on a number of assumptions and estimates and does not purport to give pro forma effect to any acquisitions in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. As a result, such financial information may be materially different from pro forma financial information prepared in accordance with Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such financial information. In addition, this offering memorandum presents certain acquired revenue information for completed acquisitions. Acquired revenue is based on the historical revenue of the acquired business as reported in accordance with GAAP or, if such information is not available, management’s estimate of the historical revenue of the acquired business, in each case during the 12-month period preceding the applicable acquisition. Acquired revenue is estimated based on information available upon completion of the applicable acquisition and does not give effect to any synergies, performance improvements or other changes to revenue following such acquisition. In addition, ----- acquired revenue and certain adjustments in Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA are only calculated on the basis of a full fiscal year and accordingly do not reflect any seasonality or variability in revenue during any interim period or otherwise during the course of the fiscal year. There are inherent challenges in measuring these metrics, which are calculated based on a number of assumptions and estimates, and they are not necessarily indicative of historical revenue or net income calculated in accordance with GAAP or future net service revenues or net income, if any, that may be generated by any acquired business following the applicable acquisition. Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, as used in this offering memorandum, the terms (i) “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to HAH Holdings LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries, including HAH Group Holding Company LLC, and (ii) the “Issuer” refers to HAH Group Holding Company LLC and not to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates. Further, references to “you” and “your” refer to prospective investors in the notes that receive this offering memorandum. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this offering memorandum, including, without limitation, statements regarding our future financial results, future financial position, business strategy, anticipated growth, future growth and revenues, expected synergies and cost savings, future economic conditions and performance, plans, objectives and strategies for future operations, expectations and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forwardlooking statements. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “continues,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “outlook,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “seeks,” “should,” “trends,” “will” or the negative thereof or variations thereon or similar terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. These statements are based upon information available to management as of the date of this offering memorandum, and such information may be limited or incomplete, and such statements should not be read to indicate that management has conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and subject to change, and recipients are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. This offering memorandum contains forecasts with respect to the impact of certain regulatory changes on our financial position and results of operations. These forecasts should not be relied upon as being necessarily indicative of future results. The assumptions and estimates underlying the forecasts are preliminary in nature and are inherently uncertain and subject to a wide variety of significant risks, contingencies and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forecasts. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the forecasts will be indicative of our future performance or that actual results will not differ materially from those presented in the forecasts. The forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with guidance or rules of the SEC, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) or any other applicable accounting principles and have inherent limitations. Future events, including events beyond our control, could materially impact the forecasts presented in this offering memorandum. All forecasts are “forward looking statements” and subject to significant risks, contingencies and uncertainties. There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements contained in this offering memorandum, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, those described under “Risk Factors.” These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this offering memorandum. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. All forward-looking statements included in this offering memorandum are made only as of the date of this offering memorandum and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements included herein. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance, unless expressed as such, and should only be viewed as historical data. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,140,MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA,140.1,,140.1.1,,"Market data and industry information presented in this offering memorandum are based on management’s knowledge of the industry in which we operate, including information regarding expected market growth trends and our total addressable market, information from independent industry and research organizations, other third-party sources and management estimates. All of the market data and industry information used in this offering memorandum involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. Although we believe that these sources supporting the estimated market position, market opportunity and market size information are reliable, we cannot guarantee the accuracy or completeness of this information, which is inherently uncertain and imprecise, and was derived in part from management’s estimates and beliefs. We have not independently verified this information. No representations or warranties are made by us or any of our affiliates as to the accuracy of any such statements or projections. Projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industry in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in “Risk Factors” and “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Any industry forecasts are based on data (including third-party data), models and experience of various professionals and are based on various assumptions, all of which are subject to change without notice. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in our estimates and beliefs and in the estimates prepared by independent parties. Throughout this offering memorandum, all references to a “net promoter score” (“NPS”) refer to a measure of client and caregiver satisfaction widely used in the healthcare industry. We calculate our NPS using industry standard methodologies and based on responses to client and caregiver surveys, which are administered at the time of service. The survey asks the client to rank, on a scale of zero to 10, how likely the client would be to recommend our services to a friend. The survey asks the caregiver to rank, on a scale of zero to 10, how likely the caregiver would be to recommend us as an employer to a friend. We believe that this method of calculation aligns with industry standards and that this metric is meaningful for investors because of the correlation between NPS and client and caregiver satisfaction. The NPS for 2023 that we discuss in this offering memorandum was calculated based on the survey responses of 5,806 clients and 6,420 caregivers during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, 4,678 clients and 12,539 caregivers during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, 7,127 clients and 16,247 caregivers during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, 3,873 clients and 17,158 caregivers during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 and a total of approximately 21,500 clients and 52,400 caregivers across our markets during the year ended December 31, 2023. The NPS for 2024 that we discuss in this offering memorandum was calculated based on the survey responses of approximately 4,741 clients and 16,842 caregivers during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, 4,337 clients and 18,463 caregivers during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 and a total of 9,078 clients and 35,305 caregivers across our markets during the six months ended June 30, 2024. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,271,NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,271.1,,271.1.1,,"In addition to financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, this offering memorandum presents certain non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful supplemental financial metrics that provide investors with additional information to assess our performance and ability to service our indebtedness. Management uses these measures to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. We define EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) tax expense, net and (iii) interest expense, net. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for (i) equity compensation expense, (ii) results of operations of exited geographies following the decision to exit, (iii) net loss from the Care Coordination Group start-up, (iv) severance costs, (v) costs incurred related to transformational activities, including acquisition and disposition-related expenses, gains and losses, capital markets and strategic transaction expenses and noncapitalizable costs associated with technology and process transformation, and (vi) other non-recurring costs or costs that we believe are not indicative of our core operations. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted (x) to give effect to net income associated with completed acquisitions as if each such acquisition had occurred on the first day of the period presented and (y) for the estimated impact of rate increases on net service revenues and cost of service revenues, as if each such increase and corresponding impact had occurred on the first day of the period presented.

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are a leading healthcare services company focused on delivering high-quality personal care services primarily to elderly individuals with complex chronic medical needs so they can age in place in a cost effective and preferred setting of care – the home. Founded in 1975, we believe we are the largest home care provider in the United States based on revenue derived from personal care services, with net service revenues of $2.15 billion and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $269.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. We operate across 11 states serving approximately 67,000 clients and providing approximately 80 million hours of care in the home on an annualized basis as of June 30, 2024. Attractive Geographic Footprint Help at Home’s mission is To Enable Individuals to Have Great Days with Independence and Dignity at Home and we strive to create a workplace that values Service, Accountability, Integrity, Teamwork and Innovation. We deliver essential care to some of the most vulnerable individuals in our society who have few reliable alternatives to remain independent in their homes. We employ a dedicated care workforce, including approximately 58,000 caregivers as of June 30, 2024, that is trained to provide services and supports for activities of daily living (“ADL”), address health-related social needs (“HRSN”) and coordinate care and other services for clients in their homes. Our care workforce performs a wide range of services, including assistance with ambulation, bathing and grooming, medication reminders and closing gaps in care. We believe our care model is highly differentiated within the broader healthcare ecosystem due to our ability to engage clients in a trusted relationship that is characterized by both high frequency of visits and long duration of service, giving us unique perspectives into the complex chronic population we serve. Our Home Care operating segment, which accounted for more than 99% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, provides non-medical personal care services to support ADL for individuals with complex chronic health care needs, such as assistance with ambulation, bathing and grooming and ----- medication reminders. In addition, our frequent and regular interactions with these individuals over the course of an average of approximately four years can create opportunities to improve care through expanded services in a high engagement “Care Coordination” model. We have developed a Care Coordination operating segment (which has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues) with offerings designed to identify and prevent the exacerbation of chronic conditions, help close gaps in care and connect individuals with primary and specialty care. The programs we have developed for Care Coordination are reinforced by strong client engagement through frequent interactions with our caregivers and digital capture of changes in condition by our care teams and are further supported by nurses, community health workers and social workers in a population-based model. We believe our Care Coordination capabilities enhance our Home Care business through increased client and caregiver retention and improved satisfaction. In comparison to other in-home based care models, such as skilled nursing and other home health care services that are required to be performed by licensed medical professionals, which tend to be episodic in nature, our home care model is designed to engage complex chronic populations on a longitudinal basis, supporting them continuously with ADL. In 2023, our compassionate caregivers spent an average of 22 hours per week in the homes of the individuals we served, and the average tenure of both clients and caregivers was approximately four years, which we believe is driven by strong satisfaction and high engagement. Our differentiated culture of “Caring for the Caregiver,” in which we emphasize the value of our dedicated caregivers and provide exceptional service to these individuals, has contributed to a 12-month caregiver retention of approximately 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. This compares to an industry-wide median retention rate of approximately 23%, which we believe reflects the broader industry’s use of caregivers on a more episodic basis and diminished emphasis on a long-term trusted partnership between caregivers and clients. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 80% of our clients were dually eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare and, as these complex chronic individuals age, their care needs expand. The services we provide allow these individuals to remain in their homes, helping avoid more costly institutional settings such as skilled nursing facilities, acute care hospitals and other higher-cost institutional sites of care. According to the Genworth Cost of Care Survey in 2023, the average daily cost of nursing home stay is estimated to be between two and three times the daily cost of home care services. Our services are primarily reimbursed on a per hour basis and funded through Medicaid home and community-based services (“HCBS”) programs, which are administered by managed care organizations (“MCOs”) or state-based agencies. In 2023, 67% of our net service revenues were derived from Medicaid MCOs, 32% were derived from state-based or local agencies that administer Medicaid long-term services and supports (“LTSS”) programs on behalf of states and the remaining 1% were derived from the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) program, private pay and other sources. We had approximately 250 distinct state, local and MCO payor sources as of June 30, 2024 and we believe that the diversity of our payors, as well as widespread governmental and MCO support for the Medicaid HCBS we deliver, provides stability in our business and helps insulate us from significant reductions in the rates we are paid. Rates are primarily based on published Medicaid fee schedules or negotiated directly with third-party payors and in some cases also include additional incentive payments for performance or quality-based metrics, providing us with an opportunity to enhance the economics of our hourlybased reimbursement model. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 0.5% of our net service revenues were derived from pay-for-performance or quality-based arrangements with payor partners. Between calendar years 2021 and 2023, our average annual reimbursement rate per hour increased by 5% on an organic basis (excluding the impact of dispositions and material acquisitions), demonstrating a supportive rate environment across our state and MCO payors. We have experienced broad rate support by these payors within our geographic footprint; the average annual reimbursement rate per hour increase between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 included the following: Delaware (3% average increase), ----- Georgia (5% average increase), Illinois (7% average increase), Indiana (11% average increase), Michigan (16% average increase), Missouri (15% average increase), Mississippi (7% average increase), New York (3% average increase), Ohio (13% average increase) and Pennsylvania (3% average increase). Help at Home Payor Mix The market in which we operate is large, highly fragmented and growing rapidly. We have been able to capitalize on market trends by generating strong organic growth and supplementing our efforts with accretive acquisitions. From 2021 to 2023, we generated a net service revenue compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 41% and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 44%. Between 2021 and 2023, our average organic net service revenue growth was 10%, we completed 19 acquisitions and we entered four new states. From January 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024, we completed an additional six acquisitions. See “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information” for more information about how we calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and organic net service revenue growth and “Presentation of Information” for a discussion of how we calculate acquired revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Industry Overview,9.2.1,,"The healthcare industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy. From 2023 to 2032, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) estimate that national healthcare expenditures are expected to increase at an annual growth rate of 5.6% from $4.8 trillion to $7.7 trillion. U.S. healthcare expenditures are being driven in part by ongoing growth in the aging population and longer life expectancy. The population of individuals 65 years of age or older is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 2.7% between 2020 and 2030 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Increasing demand for services and supports in the home is also being driven by the aging population’s health care needs, which are expected to increase over time, and a preference for aging in place. According to surveys by the American Association of Retired Persons, more than 80% of individuals 65 years of age or older prefer to age in place in the home. The dually-eligible enrollees that we primarily serve are a rapidly growing population that has higher medical costs than average Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries overall. Between 2011 and 2021, dual-eligible enrollment and spending increased at a CAGR of 2.5% and 5.3%, respectively, according to CMS. In 2021, dual-eligible enrollees represented 19% of total Medicare beneficiaries but comprised 35% of total Medicare expenditures, and together Medicare and Medicaid dual-eligible expenditures comprised approximately $493.5 billion with spending per beneficiary nearly 2.5 times that of average Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. ----- Within the broader U.S. healthcare system, the home care industry occupies a large, highly fragmented and rapidly growing market. Total industry expenditures are expected to increase from $90.0 billion in 2020 to $205.0 billion in 2028, representing a CAGR of 11%. Of the approximately 28,000 personal care providers estimated to be operating across the United States, the top 10 largest providers, including us, comprise approximately 6% of the industry’s total expenditures. We believe this large, fragmented market is highly attractive because it offers both compelling organic and inorganic growth opportunities, especially to scaled, national providers like us that can leverage technology, operational capabilities, relationships with payors and a disciplined acquisition strategy to drive growth. Home Care Industry Fragmentation ----- Medicaid HCBS programs are administered by traditional state and local authorities or Medicaid Managed long term services and supports (“MLTSS”) programs through which MCOs administer services on behalf of the state. The number of U.S. states utilizing an MLTSS model has grown meaningfully from eight states in 2004 to 24 states in 2024 according to Advancing States. As of the date of this offering memorandum, six of the 11 states in which we operate have adopted MLTSS models and three more (Georgia, Michigan and Ohio) are actively developing MLTSS programs or new managed care programs for dually-eligible LTSS beneficiaries for the future. We believe the transition to MLTSS has created structural tailwinds as payors seek to reduce their reliance on managing elderly populations within institutional settings, thereby expanding the population we can service in the home. MLTSS payors are typically paid by states on a per member per month (“PMPM”) basis for the LTSS members they enroll, thereby creating incentives to manage these members’ care in the most appropriate, highest quality and lowest cost setting. As states transition from traditional Medicaid to MLTSS, LTSS spending typically rebalances – over time – from institutional care to HCBS as more LTSS members receive services in these lower cost settings. We believe this MLTSS transition can also result in an increase in the average authorized care plans of clients as payors seek to support LTSS members in their homes longer as they age and their needs increase over time. In addition, as MLTSS markets mature over time, payors frequently introduce performance-based or quality-based incentive reimbursement programs and seek scaled provider partners with which to innovate on these types of value-based arrangements. As depicted in the chart below, the share of Medicaid LTSS spending has shifted significantly from institutional care settings to HCBS settings, with HCBS comprising 62% of LTSS spending in 2020 as compared to 37% in 2005 and institutional comprising 38% of LTSS spending in 2020 as compared to 63% in 2005, based on CMS data. Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020. We believe federal and state policy makers and third-party payors recognize the cost savings of home care compared to institutional settings such as long-term care facilities, the societal benefits associated with aging in place in the community and the need to support a care workforce that has experienced shortages over time. We also believe these structural factors help support the long-term viability and potential growth of our business. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Competitive Strengths,9.3.1,"serve. We employ a culture of “Caring for the Caregiver,” which focuses on thoughtful and continuous","engagement with our employees to enable them to succeed in their roles. We believe this enables us to attract compassionate, dedicated individuals committed to supporting the clients we serve in their homes and their communities. This culture emphasizes the value and impact of our caregivers, and we have developed a technology-enabled service model that provides 24/7 support to our care workforce. We believe that our culture enables us to recruit, motivate and empower our team members at all levels to deliver high-quality home care services and enhance our operating performance. Our culture is inclusive and creates an environment that allows people of all backgrounds to be successful. We believe our culture of “Caring for the Caregiver” is core to our success and differentiated in our industry, contributing to what we believe are industry-leading caregiver retention rates and strong satisfaction rates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a 12-month caregiver retention rate of approximately 66%, relative to the industry-wide median retention rate for 2022 of approximately 23%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our 12-month caregiver retention rate increased to approximately 68% and we had client and caregiver NPS of 58 and 41, respectively. We believe our “Caring for the Caregiver” culture and extensive initiatives to improve caregiver retention generate a positive flywheel effect that improves client-caregiver matching and contributes to higher caregiver and client satisfaction, thereby driving the success of our business. Our clients are referred to us primarily by managed care payors and state-based agencies that support LTSS-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries in securing services with a high-quality home care provider that can meet their needs. According to Kaiser Family Foundation research, approximately six million individuals were served by Medicaid LTSS programs as of 2020. Care plans for our clients are developed and authorized by these payors and are typically designed to support ADLs to avoid progression to a more costly setting such as a long-term care facility. ----- Our clients are typically highly vulnerable individuals (most of them are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid) who rely on our continued interaction and support to remain healthy and avoid more costly settings of care. The states in which we operate recognize the value of our services, which has led to significant growth in our client census, while also maintaining an average client tenure of approximately four years, differentiating us from the more episodic nature of care delivered by other home health companies. Help at Home Average Client Census Over Time and Key Client Statistics Note: Metrics as of June 30, 2024. - **_Our business model is aligned with macro trends in healthcare. Healthcare expenditures in the United States are rising rapidly and the most complex chronic patients are a significant driver of this expenditure growth. Home care is part of the cost solution, particularly following the challenges affecting healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumer preferences to avoid facility-based long term care settings and imperatives by payors to reduce utilization in higher cost institutional settings contribute to the attractiveness of home-based care. We believe that our reach into the homes of many patient populations with the highest medical costs if treated in institutional settings positions us to help deliver a better experience for our clients and their families, facilitate improvements in clinical outcomes and reduce costs in healthcare delivery. - **_Our national scale and local density create competitive advantages. We believe that our focus on local market density combined with national scale, and our proven ability to grow distinguishes us in the home care market. The benefits of scale typically include (a) state-wide coverage, positioning us well to serve a larger portion of the population with stronger brand awareness in our markets and to receive a greater share of referrals, (b) being the provider of choice to innovate with payor partners, (c) being the employer of choice for caregivers, (d) being the acquiror of choice for local and regional sellers, and (e) the ability to leverage our field infrastructure over a larger revenue base to gain operating efficiencies. `o` _Our growth orientation. We have doubled the size of our business since 2021, growing from $1.0 billion of net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $2.0 billion of net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, generating a net service revenue CAGR of 41%, organic net service revenue growth averaging 10% per annum and inorganic growth from acquisitions. `o` _Our market leadership in our geographies. Across the 11 states in which we operate, we have built significant regional market density and believe we hold a leading position in four of these states, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Mississippi, and we are among the largest home care operators in the remaining states. We believe our market leadership provides a differentiated opportunity to gain share organically and be opportunistic with acquisitions. ----- `o` _Our sophisticated Centerline Operating Model and purpose-built technology environment. Our business is supported by our scalable operating model which we believe offers advantages by blending central efficiencies with local market presence to drive performance. This operating model, which we refer to as the Centerline Operating Model, is based on the standardization of technology, support and incentive structures for our staff. Our Centerline Operating Model provides for consistency in measuring operating and performance metrics, such as care plan authorizations and utilization rates, hiring and retention metrics, census trends and satisfaction scores, as well as standardization of our regulatory reporting and core business functions across all of our markets. We have developed a purpose-built technology environment to support our Centerline Operating Model, including a data integration layer that allows us to generate real-time business insights and analytics across agency management systems and enterprise-wide systems such as human capital management, payroll and finance. Since implementing our Centerline Operating Model in 2021, we have continued to make refinements to respond to market needs and to serve our key constituencies – our care teams, our clients and our communities – even more effectively. In addition, these investments in technology allow us to enhance our patient care capabilities by helping identify preventative solutions proactively, address gaps in care and minimize the likelihood of costly and adverse events such as admissions to institutional settings of care. `o` _Our differentiated recruiting and retention engine. We believe the demand for home care services has outpaced the supply of caregivers and other care workers in certain markets, and we see an opportunity as an industry leader to leverage our recruiting and retention capabilities to increase the supply of labor. We believe our strong reputation of caring for caregivers, clients and our communities at the national and local level, coupled with investments we have made in technology, processes, training and onboarding, provide advantages in recruiting and retaining caregivers. We believe that we attract more caregivers due to our higher number of available client care plans near our caregivers’ homes, local brand awareness and our commitment to a culture of “Caring for the Caregiver.” From 2021 to 2023, we have grown the number of employed caregivers at a CAGR of 28%. We continue to focus on improving our recruiting capabilities to support and increase the quality of our care workforce to create additional capacity to meet the rising demand for home care services in our markets. We have invested in management talent and technology to streamline and digitize our recruiting processes which has improved our recruiting yield, lowered recruiting costs per candidate and reduced administrative burden. Our differentiated recruiting engine allows us to engage with candidates on a 24x7 basis and convert qualified applicants into new hires more rapidly, while straight-through-processing allows us to digitally populate candidate data into our human capital management and payroll system to improve data accuracy. From the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2024, we improved the number of caregivers hired per business day from approximately 65 to approximately 150, and during the same period we improved our 12-month caregiver retention rate by almost two percentage points to 67%. We have initiatives in place that are designed to improve caregiver retention further with a particular focus on 30-day and 90-day retention metrics, which were 94% and 87% as of June 30, 2024, respectively. We believe these metrics are important determinants for retention, which generates a positive flywheel effect resulting in a more successful client-caregiver matching processes and higher caregiver and client satisfaction. Our scale has allowed us to invest into resources and strategies including advanced analytics to improve matching based on client-caregiver personal preferences, targeted training and on-boarding enhancements, increased specialization of certain central support functions and mobile-based digital tools to support more efficient workflows. We have numerous initiatives in place to improve our recruiting and retention metrics as we continue to refine our processes to grow our care workforce. ----- Help at Home Total Caregivers Over Time and Key Retention Statistics Note: Metrics as of June 30, 2024. - **_Our strong history of successfully sourcing, executing and integrating acquisitions into Help at Home. Our highly experienced corporate development team consists of professionals with extensive experience and strong reputations that allow us to identify potential acquisition targets efficiently and effectively. Our acquisition strategy is centered on identifying targets that: `o` have strong reputations for delivering high quality home care; `o` can increase our presence in existing geographies; `o` can enhance our partnership opportunities with MCOs in states that have transitioned or plan to transition their Medicaid programs to MLTSS programs; `o` can grow the population of complex chronic dual-eligible beneficiaries we can serve; `o` are situated in states that have a history of supportive reimbursement rate environments; and `o` are in markets that are supportive of value-based care offerings in the home. We have a track record of creating value following acquisitions by driving synergies through administrative cost savings, implementing our effective recruiting and retention capabilities, constructively collaborating with payors and optimizing our operations within the context of our payor agreements. Between January 1, 2021 and August 31, 2024, we completed 25 acquisitions. We deployed $703.3 million in aggregate purchase price towards the acquisitions completed during this time period and acquired revenue of $825.3 million based on each acquired company’s revenue in the 12-month period preceding the applicable acquisition. We have also demonstrated the ability to deleverage our balance sheet from consolidated net leverage of 5.9x as of December 31, 2021 to 4.3x as of June 30, 2024 without giving effect to the Transactions. We remain committed to exploring opportunistic acquisition targets as they emerge. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, we completed 10 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million and acquired revenue of $145.8 million based on each acquired company’s revenue in the 12-month period preceding the applicable acquisition. ----- Help at Home Cumulative Acquisition Spend (2021 – August 2024) Note: Figures for the New York Acquisition in 2022 include the earn-out subsequently paid in 2023. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” - **_Our exceptional management team has a proven track record. We are led by what we consider is a best-in- class management team with more than 250 years of combined healthcare experience. Our team includes members that have a strong track record of successfully building and scaling multi-billion dollar businesses and executing on operational initiatives and growth strategies in larger public company environments. Our management team has significant managed care experience, which we believe is a competitive advantage as states transition to MLTSS and payor partners seek home care providers that can innovate, deliver high quality care and outperform consistently as industry standards increase. Our executive leadership team is also supported by experienced regional leadership teams, clinical leadership and a field support center with approximately 400 administrative staff. - **_Strong culture of compliance. We believe our focus on compliance provides consistency in our outcomes and produces high quality care. We maintain a company-wide ethics and compliance program designed to ensure that we maintain high standards of ethical conduct in the operation of our business that strive to meet or exceed applicable regulatory guidance and industry standards. We implement, review and refine written policies and procedures for our employees to promote compliance with our policies and applicable laws and regulations and to encourage a “culture of compliance.” We have devised governance structures to oversee our ethics and compliance program and encourage transparency and accountability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Our Growth Strategy,9.4.1,,"The key elements of our growth strategy include: - **_Drive attractive organic growth. Home care is a large and rapidly growing industry, with spending expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2023 through 2028 due to aging demographics, consumer preferences and broad payor support for care in the home over higher-cost institutional care settings. Between 2021 and 2023, our average organic net service revenue growth was approximately 10% driven by approximately 5% volume and approximately 5% reimbursement rate growth. We have historically achieved significant growth through our deliberate selection of states with highly supportive HCBS programs, our local and regional market density, the sophistication of our operations, including our differentiated recruiting and retention capabilities, and our commitment to quality. We believe our market density strategy also allows us to leverage payor partner relationships to increase natural growth across our markets. We have driven organic growth in net service ----- revenues by growing both clients and hours served with our differentiated recruiting and retention engine that has increased our recruitment of dedicated, compassionate caregivers, thereby enabling us to serve more clients and retain existing clients by servicing authorized care plans to optimal levels. We have also driven organic growth by focusing on operational processes that increase client NPS, such as centralized client intake, enhanced analytics for client-caregiver matching, improved communication and advanced digital tools to support our care workforce. Our client NPS was 58 for the year ended December 31, 2023, increasing significantly from 53 for the year ended December 31, 2021 when we first began measuring client NPS. - **_Execute operational initiatives to enhance growth and profitability. We have strategies in place that we believe can create additional growth opportunities and support our margin profile as we leverage our scalable operating model. We expect to increase our reimbursement rates through payor negotiations and the introduction of performance-based incentives and participation in value-based care arrangements, all of which are designed to align with the goals of the value-based care model, which include improved provider economics based on the delivery of higher quality care. Our payor relations team works closely with MCO and state-based partners to identify opportunities for us to be reimbursed differentially when we deliver higher performance and quality care or provide additional services in connection with MCO partners’ value-based care programs. In addition, we have initiatives in place to improve our margin profile by advancing our technology infrastructure with scalable enterprise IT solutions and by scaling our corporate infrastructure over a larger revenue base. During the past two years, we have substantially implemented a new enterprise-wide human capital management and payroll system, a new enterprise-wide financial reporting system and we have also substantially integrated our core operating systems onto a single platform that is optimized into a consistent proprietary data integration layer. We have also built shared service capabilities in key functional areas such as facilities, procurement, payroll and contact center, among others. Our general and administrative expense as a percentage of net service revenues, excluding expenses that are not central to our business or are non-recurring, declined 130 basis points to 12.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. We believe the benefits of these enterprise-wide capability enhancements will increase in the coming years as we leverage the investment and fixed costs of this infrastructure across a larger revenue base. - **_Explore opportunistic acquisitions of compelling targets to accelerate growth. We intend to continue focusing on our strong history of identifying and executing acquisitions within a highly fragmented market landscape. Our acquisition strategy targets transactions that can support the build-out of our market presence in states in which we operate. Subject to any applicable regulatory constraints, on an opportunistic basis, we intend to enter new markets through transactions where we will seek to partner with organizations that have a track record of high-quality care and compliance and operate in markets that meet our strategic criteria. We believe we are viewed as an acquiror of choice in the home care sector given our culture, operational expertise and reputation after nearly 50 years of operations. As a result, the majority of the 25 acquisitions we have completed from 2021 through August 31, 2024 have been self-sourced or exclusive transactions. Since 2021, we have entered four new states (Delaware, Florida, Ohio and New York) and exited three states (Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee) that did not meet our long-term strategy. We are focused on a disciplined approach to capital allocation towards attractively priced transactions that offer potential post-acquisition cost synergies and growth opportunities. - **_Expand offerings to better serve our clients. Constituents across the healthcare system recognize the value of the home care services we deliver, including the MCOs and federal and state governments that stand to benefit from the cost savings we can deliver. We believe the long-term, trusted relationships we have with individuals in their homes are our most important asset, positioning us on the front lines of care with an ability to help improve health outcomes, reduce costs and drive health equity. We are employing these durational relationships to care for the complex chronic individuals we serve and we are investing in capabilities to expand our services to offer higher levels of clinical care coordination, support with health related social needs, medication management and nutrition, among others in our Care Coordination business. Our frequent and regular interactions with these individuals over the course of an average of approximately four years can create opportunities to improve care through expanded services in a high-engagement care model. We have developed offerings designed to identify and prevent the exacerbation of chronic conditions, help close gaps in care and connect individuals with primary and specialty care. The programs we have developed for Care Coordination are reinforced by strong client engagement through frequent interactions with our caregivers and digital capture of changes in condition by our care teams and are further supported by nurses, community health workers and ----- social workers in a population-based model. We believe these Care Coordination capabilities enhance our Home Care business through increased client and caregiver retention and improved satisfaction. We believe that these capabilities have also accelerated our ability to enter into value-based care arrangements with MCOs and riskbased providers. The value-based arrangements for Care Coordination are typically reimbursed on a PMPM basis with shared savings opportunities. Approximately 5,000 of our clients are served in these expanded offerings and we intend to further penetrate our client base with more of these programs and increased opportunities with risk-bearing partners in our markets. Our Care Coordination segment has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues to date. - **_Evaluate opportunities to strategically expand into adjacent markets with home care services. We believe that we have an opportunity to extend our core Medicaid home care service line of business to capture volume from additional payor sources, such as VA, private pay and Medicare Advantage supplemental home care markets, which represented approximately 1% of total net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. We intend to opportunistically evaluate opportunities across these adjacent markets in existing and new states and diversify our payor and customer base, while still remaining focused as a market leader in the core Medicaid home care offering.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.5,Recent Developments,9.5.1,,"_Recent Acquisitions_ Since June 30, 2024, we have completed two transactions in Georgia and Illinois for aggregate cash consideration of $1.5 million and acquired revenue of $3.7 million based on each acquired company’s revenue in the 12-month period preceding the applicable acquisition. This offering memorandum does not present any standalone financial statements for such transactions, and no pro forma financial information under Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act is included herein. See “Presentation of Information.” _New York Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program Regulatory Changes_ New York’s Medicaid home care program comprises an agency-based model, Licensed Home Care Services Agency (“LHCSA”), and a separate alternative self-directed model, the Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (“CDPAP”), which is unique to the New York market. Broadly speaking, under the agency-based model, we recruit and train professional caregivers and match them to clients they are well-suited to serve. Under a self-directed model, consumers choose their own caregiver to serve as a caregiver and receive compensation. In New York’s CDPAP, the chosen caregiver requires what is referred to as a “Fiscal Intermediary,” or “FI,” to act as the employer of record and manage various administrative tasks on behalf of the caregiver, whereas in other states in which we operate we manage self-directed caregivers through the agencybased model. We recognized approximately $375.0 million in net service revenues from the CDPAP program for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and the program accounted for approximately 11% of our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 attributable to New York operations was split approximately evenly between the CDPAP and LHCSA models; however, margins from the LHCSA model are higher than CDPAP due to higher MCO rates and quality incentive payments that are available only to LHCSA providers. In an effort to increase accountability and regulate quality, cost reporting, licensure and marketing in connection with CDPAP, in 2019 New York initiated a new request for offer (“RFO”) process to competitively procure CDPAP FIs, a measure that would ultimately reduce the number of participating providers. However, the New York legislature intervened in 2022, authorizing fiscal intermediary applicants that satisfied certain criteria to continue operating, effectively eliminating the competitive procurement process. CDPAP continues to be a focus for changes by New York governmental authorities. Most recently, the New York fiscal year 2025 budget, which was signed by the governor on April 20, 2024, included a plan to move administration of the CDPAP to a single FI selected by the New York State Department of Health (“NYSDOH”) by April 1, 2025. Under this initiative, all current and future service providers seeking to offer services under CDPAP’s self-directed model would be required to contract directly or indirectly with this single statewide fiscal intermediary. As of the date of this offering ----- memorandum, there is considerable opposition to the statewide fiscal intermediary plan, including ongoing litigation and recently proposed legislation to block its implementation. We are currently not seeking to be selected as the single statewide fiscal intermediary and it is not possible at this time to assess the likelihood of becoming a subcontractor or the financial terms of any such arrangement. However, if the statewide fiscal intermediary is adopted, we have strategies that we currently believe could potentially mitigate the economic impact of the current proposal to 5% or less of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. However, it is difficult to predict the details of the implementation and final timeline of the single statewide FI, and although we currently do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our business as a whole, the potential discontinuation of the current CDPAP model in New York could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations and, in particular, could significantly impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. Our assessment of the impact of these changes on our business are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, which are subject to change, and there are a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks posed by the New York legislation if implemented. At this time, we do not expect similar legislation to be implemented in the other states in which we operate; however, we cannot predict the existence, timing or nature of any future legislative or regulatory initiatives. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement—Reductions in reimbursement by third-party payors and other changes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal, state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our revenues, profits and profitability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes to the CDPAP model in New York could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” _CMS Ensuring Access to Medicaid Final Rule (CMS-2442-F)_ On April 22, 2024, CMS announced a final rule intended to improve access to services and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries across fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems. The final rule includes several measures intended to promote transparency and enhance quality and access to services, including a variety of reporting requirements for states. The final rule also includes significant provisions related to HCBS, including the “80/20” or “payment adequacy” requirement, which will require states to ensure that at least 80% of all Medicaid payments a provider receives for homemaker, home health aide and personal care services, less certain excluded costs, under certain programs are spent on total compensation (including benefits) for direct care workers and clinical/care supervisory workers furnishing these services, rather than administrative overhead or profit, subject to limited exceptions. States are required to ensure compliance with the 80/20 requirement by mid-2030. In comparison to the proposed rule, the final rule made a number of technical changes to the definitions used in calculating compliance that clarified or narrowed the revenue covered by the calculation and clarified or expanded the payments to workers that are counted in satisfying the requirement, which combined to make compliance less onerous to providers. We believe there is the potential for further changes to the final rule given the long implementation period, the potential for future litigation, administration changes, further sub-regulatory rule-making and state changes in response to the final rule. Although we currently believe the final rule would not have a material impact on our business, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the final rule in future periods. Any changes to our strategy as a result could significantly impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement—Changes to existing government healthcare programs and healthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to profitably offer our services and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Maturity..................................................................... The notes will mature on          , 2031. Interest....................................................................... Interest on the notes will accrue at a rate of         % per annum.

Guarantees................................................................. The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis by Holdings and by each of our existing and future wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries that is a guarantor under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, subject to certain exceptions. As of the date of this offering memorandum, we do not have any foreign subsidiaries or nonwholly owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and no such subsidiaries (to the extent formed or acquired in the future) are expected to guarantee the notes in the future. The guarantees are subject to release under specified circumstances. See “Description of Notes—Guarantees.” For the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes represented an immaterial amount of our total assets, net service revenues and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Security ..................................................................... The notes and related guarantees will be secured by a first-priority lien, subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens, on substantially all of our and the guarantors’ assets (other than the Excluded Assets (as defined in “Description of Notes”)), which assets will also secure the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and certain other indebtedness that is permitted to be secured by such assets on a first-priority basis. First Lien Intercreditor Agreement ........................... We will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the “First Lien Intercreditor Agreement”) with the Notes Collateral Agent (as defined herein) and Jefferies Finance LLC, the administrative agent and collateral agent under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities (the “Bank Collateral Agent”). The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will set forth the rights of, and relationship among, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee, the holders of the notes, the Bank Collateral Agent and the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the applicable ----- representative of the holders under any other future parity lien debt party thereto in respect of lien priority on, the exercise of rights and remedies against, and other creditors’ rights issues with respect to, the collateral of the Issuer and the guarantors. In addition, holders of the notes will waive a number of rights otherwise accruing to secured lenders in bankruptcy. For a description of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, see “Description of Notes—Security— First Lien Intercreditor Agreement.” Ranking ..................................................................... The notes and the related guarantees will be our and the guarantors’, respectively, senior secured obligations and will rank: - equal in right of payment, without giving effect to collateral arrangements, with all of our and the guarantors’ other existing and future senior indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; - senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; - equal in priority as to the collateral with respect to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; - effectively senior to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future unsecured indebtedness and indebtedness that is secured by the collateral on a basis that is junior to the notes, in each case to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the notes; - effectively subordinated to all of our and the guarantors’ existing and future indebtedness that is secured by a lien on assets that do not constitute part of the collateral, to the extent of the value of such assets; and - structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of our existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the notes. As of June 30, 2024, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately $1,500.0 million of total debt outstanding, all of which would have been secured on an equal priority basis, consisting of $600.0 million of the notes offered hereby and $900.0 million of amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. We would also have had $250.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, all of which would have been secured on an equal priority basis with the notes. See the sections entitled “Capitalization” and “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.” ----- For the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, on an as adjusted basis after giving effect to the Transactions, our subsidiaries that will not guarantee the notes represented an immaterial amount of our total assets, net service revenues and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. However, in the future we may have material non-guarantor subsidiaries and the notes will not receive any guarantees from subsidiaries that do not become guarantors, and liabilities at such subsidiaries would be structurally senior to the notes.

We also believe total hours provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our net service revenues. This metric pertains solely to the Home Care segment and excludes the Care Coordination Group. For more information about how we calculate key performance indicators, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” (4) We define organic net service revenue growth as the percentage change in net service revenues over the applicable period adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and material acquisitions. We define material acquisitions as any acquisition contributing more than $10.0 million in revenues for the twelve-month period preceding the completion of the transaction. We believe this metric is useful in evaluating trends in our business as it allows us to measure revenue growth in a consistent manner across periods. The nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary significantly from period to period and adjusting for the impact of such transactions facilitates comparability of results. For more information about how we calculate key performance indicators, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” This metric excludes any acquisitions we have completed since June 30, 2024. See “—Recent Developments.” (5) We define EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) tax expense, net and (iii) interest expense, net. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for (i) equity compensation expense, (ii) results of operations of exited geographies following the decision to exit, (iii) net loss from the Care Coordination Group start-up, (iv) severance costs, (v) costs incurred related to transformational activities, including acquisition and disposition-related expenses, gains and losses, capital markets and strategic transaction expenses and non-capitalizable costs associated with technology and process ----- transformation, and (vi) other non-recurring costs or costs that we believe are not indicative of our core operations. Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA represents Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted (x) to give effect to net income associated with completed acquisitions as if each such acquisition had occurred on the first day of the period presented and (y) for the estimated impact of rate increases on net service revenues and cost of service revenues, as if each such increase and corresponding impact had occurred on the first day of the period presented. See “NonGAAP Financial Measures.” Below is a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to (loss) income from continuing operations for the periods presented.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

(collectively, the “New York Acquisition”). The acquisition earn-out was recorded as an operating expense due to the continued employment of a previous owner during fiscal year 2022. In June 2023, an agreement was reached whereby (i) we paid $108.3 million in cash to the New York Acquisition seller and (ii) the New York Acquisition seller surrendered certain rollover equity valued at $14.7 million. Accordingly, we recorded a $26.4 million benefit during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2023. (b) In November 2022, we completed the sale of certain non-core operations historically reported within the Home Care segment for $0.3 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.2 million. This disposal did not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. (c) For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment charges of $53.6 million included (i) $10.2 million related to the sale of the Adaptive Hospice business for a purchase price of $10.4 million (the “Hospice Disposition”) and the final loss on sale measured at closing and classified as impairment; and (ii) $43.4 million to fully impair the goodwill of the former Skilled Care reporting unit during the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment due to the surrender of certain Skilled Care operating licenses and the Hospice Disposition. During the year ended December 31, 2021, (i) a $0.2 million impairment charge was recorded as a result of declines in business performance in connection with the sale of the Community Living operating segment to National Mentor Holdings, Inc. in August 2021 for $16.7 million (the “Community Living Disposition”) and (ii) a $3.6 million impairment charge was recorded as a result of the identification of certain impairment triggers related to our amortizable intangible assets, including trade name and market access assets, in connection with the Community Living Disposition. ----- (d) We reached a strategic decision to exit the Alabama market effective October 1, 2023 and to exit certain of our Florida operations effective January 1, 2024. As operations in these states were wound down and these operations are not viewed as part of our ongoing operations, we excluded any financial net expense or benefit from the respective date of the decision to exit. (e) We launched the Care Coordination business in 2021 and began limited revenue generating operations in 2022. For financial reporting purposes, HAH Holdings LLC defines Home Care and Care Coordination, which includes the Care Coordination Group, as separate operating segments. The Care Coordination segment has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues as of the date of this offering memorandum, and the Care Coordination Group will not guarantee or provide collateral support for the notes. In light of the foregoing, we do not view the current financial performance of the Care Coordination segment as indicative of future revenue or costs and view activity of the segment in 2022 through 2024 as start-up costs that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. For additional information, see “Presentation of Information.” (f) We do not currently have a recurring equity grant plan; however, equity compensation is awarded for specific events and circumstances. There is no cash settlement currently required for equity awards. Refer to Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information. (g) Cost of service revenues include certain duplicative costs related to systems migrations and insurance policies after certain acquisitions that do not represent ongoing costs of the business post-acquisition and are eliminated at the conclusion of the relevant overlap period. (h) Severance actions have been taken in each of the periods presented for reasons including, but not limited to: (i) changes in key corporate and operational personnel to align with corporate strategy and operational effectiveness; (ii) changes in personnel to align costs and operating structure with a redefined operating model; and (iii) changes in market strategy. (i) Since 2021, we have made significant investment in our revenue cycle management program, including: (i) creation of a centralized data warehouse allowing for approximately real-time visibility and management of payor level data; (ii) centralization of the authorization management process; (iii) centralization of the billing and collection process and team; and (iv) addition of key personnel to manage and monitor this function. Management identified instances in 2023, 2022 and 2021 where an elevated amount of receivables was identified as uncollectible due to past practices. Where the elevated losses were ascribed to specific facts and circumstances and specific geographies and a remediation plan has been put into place, the financial statement impact of the incremental loss is reflected in this adjustment. (j) We have incurred operating expenses related to strategic transactions, strategic initiatives, process optimization and legal and other matters. Costs related to strategic transactions include due diligence and integration costs as well as costs incurred and expensed to finance these transactions. Costs related to strategic initiatives include costs related to deployment of recruiting tools, caregiver mobile application and interface, implementation of our operating model and other similar projects. Process optimization costs consist primarily of temporary labor, advisory and recruiting fees incurred as we transformed our internal processes and personnel. This also includes costs incurred related to improvements to cybersecurity and IT infrastructure. Legal costs consist primarily of third-party fees incurred related primarily to strategic transactions, capital structure, government relations matters and certain corporate or litigation matters. Legal costs also include settlements of $1.5 million in 2023 and $0.8 million in 2022 that we do not expect to recur.

(l) This adjustment gives effect to net income associated with completed acquisitions as if each such acquisition had occurred on the first day of the period presented. This adjustment only includes transactions that have closed by the end of the period presented. When the transaction has been part of our results of operations for only a portion of the period, we estimate the impact to net income as if the transaction had occurred on the first day of the period presented. Our estimate is based on information available upon completion of the applicable acquisition and is only calculated on the basis of a full fiscal year and accordingly does not reflect any seasonality or variability during any interim period or otherwise during the course of the fiscal year. See “Presentation of Information.” (m) This adjustment reflects the estimated impact of rate increases on net service revenues and cost of service revenues, as if each such increase and corresponding impact had occurred on the first day of the period presented. This adjustment only includes changes in rates that have become effective as of the last day of the period presented and does not include proposed or potential future changes in rates. When changes in rates have been in effect for only a portion of the period, we estimate the amount of hours to which the revised rate would have been applicable and the resulting estimated revenue. We also estimate the expected increase in wages and ancillary costs that we would have expected to incur for ----- the same period if the rate had been effective. In all instances, our estimates assume that rate and cost changes became effective as of the first day of the period presented. (6) The ratio of pro forma net first lien debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated by dividing the aggregate outstanding principal amount of indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes after giving effect to the Transactions, net of cash of approximately $32.2 million, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. This ratio and its components may fluctuate due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in “Risk Factors,” “Business—Legal Proceedings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. (7) The ratio of pro forma net total debt to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA has been calculated by dividing the aggregate outstanding principal amount of indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the notes after giving effect to the Transactions, net of cash of approximately $32.2 million, by Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. This ratio and its components may fluctuate due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in “Risk Factors,” “Business—Legal Proceedings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. (8) The ratio of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA to pro forma cash interest expense is calculated by dividing Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA by pro forma cash interest expense. Pro forma cash interest expense is calculated by adjusting total cash interest expense to give pro forma effect to the issuance of the notes, borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities on the issue date based on an assumed blended interest rate of 9.2% and the repayment in full of the Existing Credit Facilities. Actual cash interest expense will primarily depend upon the interest rates payable on the notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and excludes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. Furthermore, the cash interest expense does not give effect to any potential future borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which will provide for up to $250.0 million of borrowings and will incur interest at a floating rate that will fluctuate. This ratio and its components may fluctuate due to the risks and uncertainties discussed in “Risk Factors,” “Business—Legal Proceedings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,"Our financial results have been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by negative macroeconomic conditions.","Economic conditions in the United States continue to be challenging in various respects, and the U.S. economy continues to experience significant inflationary pressures, elevated interest rates, challenging labor market conditions and potential adverse effects associated with current geopolitical conditions. These factors have placed significant pressure on caregiver recruitment and retention. As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased competition for new caregivers and other home care staff, which may impact our ability to attract and retain employees. Further, the inflationary conditions have resulted in, and may continue to result in, increased operating costs, particularly as the result of increased wages we have paid and may continue to pay our caregivers and other personnel and our ability to attract and retain personnel. Our ability to realize rate increases from government programs and private payors, which represent most of our revenue, might be limited despite inflation. Higher interest rates also raise our financing costs. These factors may have an unfavorable impact on our financial results in future periods which could be material. Moreover, we anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid expenditures and the aging of the U.S. population will continue to place pressure on government healthcare programs. In addition, if economic conditions in the United States significantly deteriorate, any such developments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or our cash flows, even if interest rates fall. For example, states could face significant fiscal challenges and revise their revenue forecasts and adjust their budgets, and sales tax collections and income tax receipts could be depressed. Negative macroeconomic conditions could also disrupt financial markets and capital markets and the businesses of financial institutions, potentially causing a slowdown in the decision-making of these institutions. This may affect the timing of any additional funding we may obtain and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds on terms acceptable to us, if at all.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,We are limited in our ability to control reimbursement rates received for our services. A difference between reimbursement rates and the wages we pay our caregivers could have a material adverse impact on our performance.,"The vast majority of our net service revenues are derived from hourly fee for service reimbursement rates established through state Medicaid programs or negotiated directly with payors, and our ability to grow and generate profits largely depends on the relationship between the reimbursement we receive from payors and the rates we pay our caregivers. We cannot be assured that reimbursement payments under Medicaid or other third-party payors will remain at levels comparable to present levels or will be sufficient to cover the costs allocable to clients eligible for reimbursement pursuant to these programs or that increases in wages will be accompanied by increases in rates. The cost of labor has in the past, and may in the future, increase faster than reimbursement rate increases, which may negatively impact our profitability. Furthermore, there is no assurance that payors will continue to support home-based services or provide offsetting reimbursement rate increases to mitigate increases in the cost of doing business, particularly higher wages, or that these increases will be timely. Because our gross margin may be variable across periods due to timing differences between increases in reimbursement rates and wages, our financial performance may be adversely impacted for any periods in which reimbursement rates do not increase, particularly if our costs increase. Management identified instances in 2023, 2022 and 2021 where an elevated amount of receivables were mistakenly identified as uncollectible due to past practices. Where the elevated losses were ascribed to specific facts and circumstances and specific geographies and a remediation plan has been put into place, the financial statement impact of the incremental loss is reflected in an adjustment to implicit price concession increase due to process changes. See “Summary—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” We have sought to manage our costs to achieve a desired level of profitability including, but not limited to, centralization of various processes, the use of technology to streamline ----- processes and management of employee utilization and capacity. If we are not able to continue to streamline our processes and reduce our costs, our business and financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.3,"Our net service revenues are concentrated in a small number of states and derived from a limited number of payors within those states, which makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states and affecting such payors.","Our net service revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in states in which we generate a significant portion of our revenues including New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Indiana. Accordingly, any change in the current demographic, economic, competitive or regulatory conditions in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes to the Medicaid programs in these states could also have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—Changes to the CDPAP model in New York could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.” For the year ended December 31, 2023, we derived approximately 32%, 31% and 22% of our net service revenues from services provided in New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, respectively. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services or other significant changes in these states may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. We cannot predict whether states material to our operating results will experience changes or other challenges that negatively impact our ability to be reimbursed for our services in a timely manner. Additionally, within Illinois and Pennsylvania, a significant amount of our net service revenues is derived from one payor. The Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for our Illinois operations, accounted for 15%, 18% and 23% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 14% and 16% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In Pennsylvania, Keystone accounted for 4%, 9% and 10% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Keystone accounted for less than 10% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. We may be negatively affected by changes in such payors’ policies, such as price and term demands, or other conditions or changes to their needs. If we do not effectively respond, these payors may not contract with us in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. See “—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement—Reductions in reimbursement by thirdparty payors and other changes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal, state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our revenues, profits and profitability,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business— Government Regulation and Healthcare Reform” for additional details.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.4,"Changes to the CDPAP model in New York could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","New York’s Medicaid home care program comprises an agency-based model, LHCSA, and a separate alternative self-directed model, CDPAP, which is unique to the New York market. Broadly speaking, under the agency-based model, we recruit and train professional caregivers and match them to clients they are well-suited to serve. Under a self-directed model, consumers choose their own caregiver to serve as a caregiver and receive compensation. In New York’s CDPAP, the chosen caregiver requires what is referred to as a “Fiscal Intermediary,” or “FI,” to act as the employer of record and manage various administrative tasks on behalf of the caregiver, whereas in other states in which we operate we manage self-directed caregivers through the agency-based model. We recognized approximately $375.0 million in net service revenues from the CDPAP program for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and the program accounted for approximately 11% of our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 attributable to New York operations was split approximately evenly between the CDPAP and LHCSA models; however, margins from the LHCSA model are higher than CDPAP due to higher MCO rates and quality incentive payments that are available only to LHCSA providers. In an effort to increase accountability and regulate quality, cost reporting, licensure and marketing in connection with CDPAP, in 2019 New York initiated a new RFO process to competitively procure CDPAP FIs, a measure that would ultimately reduce the number of participating providers. However, the New York legislature intervened in 2022, authorizing ----- fiscal intermediary applicants that satisfied certain criteria to continue operating, effectively eliminating the competitive procurement process. CDPAP continues to be a focus for changes by New York governmental authorities. Most recently, the New York fiscal year 2025 budget, which was signed by the governor on April 20, 2024, included a plan to move administration of the CDPAP to a single FI selected by the NYSDOH by April 1, 2025. Under this initiative, all current and future service providers seeking to offer services under CDPAP’s self-directed model would be required to contract directly or indirectly with this single statewide fiscal intermediary. As of the date of this offering memorandum, there is considerable opposition to the statewide fiscal intermediary plan, including ongoing litigation and recently proposed legislation to block its implementation. If the statewide fiscal intermediary is adopted, we have strategies that we currently believe could potentially mitigate the economic impact of the current proposal to 5% or less of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. However, it is difficult to predict the details of the implementation and final timeline of the single statewide FI, and although we currently do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our business as a whole, the potential discontinuation of the current CDPAP model in New York could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations and, in particular, could significantly impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. Our assessment of the impact of these changes on our business are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, which are subject to change, and there are a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks posed by the New York legislation if implemented.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

State government officials have in the past attempted, and in the future may attempt, to reduce government spending by proposing changes aimed at reducing expenditures by the Illinois Department on Aging. The nature and extent of impact any proposed future cost reduction initiatives may have on our business is difficult to determine. If future reforms impact the eligibility of our clients for services, the number of hours authorized or otherwise restrict services provided to the individuals we currently serve, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.6,"Our industry is highly competitive, fragmented and market-specific.","The healthcare and long-term care industries are highly competitive among service providers and care models. We compete with personal care service providers, diversified post-acute care providers and private caregivers. Although companies that provide these services are typically small “mom and pop” service providers, including single-site agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs operating without agency-based providers, some of our competitors are also large publicly held companies and well-financed privately held companies. As a result, some of these providers and competitive care models may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of clients and payors than we do. In addition, some of our competitors offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. These competitive advantages may limit our ability to attract and retain referrals in local markets and to increase our overall market share. In many states, there are limited barriers to entry in providing personal care services. However, some states require entities to obtain a license before providing home care services. Some states also require a provider to obtain a certificate of need (“CON”) before establishing certain health services, operations or facilities. CON restrictions may reduce the level of competition in a given industry or in a particular geographic region. In addition, economic changes such as increases in minimum wage and changes in Department of Labor rules can also impact the ease of entry into a market. These factors may affect competition in the states in which we operate. Often our contracts with payors are not exclusive. Local competitors may develop strategic relationships with referral sources and payors. Further, consolidation within the payor industry, vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers and cost-reduction strategies by payors continue to increase, which may affect our competitive position. In addition, existing competitors may offer new or enhanced services that we do not provide or be viewed by consumers as a more desirable local alternative. These and other factors could impact our ability to contract with payors on favorable terms, result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payors or otherwise affect our competitive ----- position. Moreover, the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings, in combination with the development of strategic relationships by our competitors, could cause a decline in revenue, a loss of market acceptance of our services and a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Trends toward price transparency and value-based purchasing may have an impact on our competitive position, ability to obtain and maintain favorable contract terms and consumer volumes. For example, health insurers must provide online price comparison tools to help individuals get personalized cost estimates for covered items and services. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) also requires health insurers to publish online the charges negotiated with providers for healthcare services. It is unclear how price transparency requirements, value-based purchasing and similar initiatives will affect consumer behavior, our relationships with payors or our ability to set and negotiate prices. We expect these competitive trends to continue. If we are unable to compete effectively, consumers may seek services from other providers, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Our ability to renew or retain our agreements depends on our quality of service and reputation, geographic coverage, as well as other factors over which we have little or no control, such as state appropriations and changes in provider eligibility requirements. Additionally, failure to satisfy any of the numerous technical renewal requirements in connection with our proposals for agreements could result in a proposal being rejected even if it contains favorable pricing terms. Failure to obtain, renew or retain agreements with major payors may negatively impact our results of operations and net service revenues. We can give no assurance these agreements will be maintained or renewed on commercially reasonable terms or at all or that MCOs will partner with us or maintain client services at current levels in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.8,Our net service revenues are based on estimates that may not accurately reflect the collection of accounts receivable.,"Net service revenues from our customer contracts are recorded based on gross charges for services provided, net of explicit contractual revenue adjustments and implicit price concessions estimated based on historical collection experience to reduce revenue to the estimated amount we expect to collect. Because these adjustments and price concessions are based on estimates and assumptions using historical collection experience, actual amounts collected from all sources may be less than the recorded net sales revenue. Management monitors net service revenues and collections from these sources and records any necessary adjustment to net service revenues based upon its assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer healthcare coverage and other collection indicators. Moreover, at each reporting date, we assess our future estimated price concessions on unpaid accounts receivable, and we estimate future price concessions based upon historical experience and other factors, including an aging of accounts receivable, evaluation of expected adjustments, past adjustments and collection experience in relation to amounts billed. However, our estimation of implicit price concessions involves significant judgment and assumptions, and differences between our estimation of implicit price concessions and estimated net service revenues may differ significantly from our collection of accounts receivable. Any real or perceived inaccuracies in measuring our net service revenues may result in a material misstatement of our financial statements, hurt our reputation and negatively affect our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

If we are unable to attract and retain qualified caregivers, the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to attract and retain personnel depends on several factors, including our ability to provide qualified caregivers with attractive assignments, flexible schedules and competitive benefits and salaries. We cannot be assured that our hiring and retention methods will continue to be successful. We compete for caregivers with other providers of social and medical services as well as companies in other servicebased industries. If the demand for home care services continues to exceed the supply of available and qualified personnel, we may be forced to enhance our pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel. We may not be able ----- to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge for our services because our ability to offer competitive wage rates is driven largely by regular increases in reimbursement rates. An increase in costs for qualified caregivers could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we experienced increased caregiver recruitment and retention costs, including hiring and retention incentives, as well as higher base compensation rates as we passed reimbursement rate increases from our payors through to our caregivers. While the impacts on us of the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, the labor markets have remained challenging as a result of both shortages in workforce and inflationary wage pressures, which may constrain our ability to recruit and retain caregivers to meet patient demand in the future. Even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits, there can be no assurance that these individuals will choose to join or continue to work for us.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

As of December 31, 2023, approximately 43% of our workforce was represented by labor unions, including Service Employees International Union and Home Health Workers of America. We have numerous agreements with local labor union affiliates which are renegotiated from time to time. These negotiations are often initiated when we receive increases in our hourly rates from various state agencies. Upon expiration of these collective bargaining agreements, we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms with these labor unions. A strike, work stoppage or other slowdown could result in a disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs, which could adversely affect our business. Moreover, potential changes to federal labor laws and regulations, including those supported by the current presidential administration, could increase the likelihood of employee unionization activity and the ability of employees to unionize. Labor costs are the most significant component of our total expenditures and, therefore, an increase in the cost of labor could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.11,Our business may be harmed with a further shift towards self-directed caregiver models operating without agency-based providers.,"Our business is primarily based on an agency model, whereby we recruit and train professional caregivers and match them to clients they are well-suited to serve. In some markets, including in markets where we operate, the state Medicaid program supports a self-directed care model in which the consumer chooses their own caregiver, such as a family member or friend, to serve as a caregiver and be compensated, in lieu of a professional caregiver. In these instances, self-directed caregivers become our employees and we are responsible for conducting background checks, performing regular screening for service provider eligibility under the HHS List of Excluded Individuals / Entities and filing documentation as required by state and federal laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with all laws and regulations with respect to preferred caregivers, we may not be reimbursed for services provided. Based on management estimates, approximately 25% of our clients received services under self-directed care models during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily in New York and Pennsylvania. While we have been able to successfully grow our business primarily through the agency model, increasing adoption of self-directed care models operating without agency-based providers may reduce the value of our services in the home care ecosystem because it may reduce the importance of our investment in recruiting, training and retaining skilled professional caregivers, matching them with the right clients based on specific client preferences. In a self-directed care model operating without an agency-based provider, the consumer typically hires their own caregiver and a company acts as a fiscal intermediary who facilitates payments from the payor to the caregiver in an administrative role. Consequently, if there is a shift towards these self-directed caregiver models that do not involve agency-based providers, our scale may become less relevant and we may lose the value of our investment in our capabilities and resources to recruit, train and match caregivers and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted We can give no assurance that we will be able to leverage our scaled national infrastructure effectively.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.12,Timing differences in reimbursement may cause liquidity problems.,"We fund operations primarily through the collection of accounts receivable, but there is a delay between the time that we provide services and the time that we receive reimbursement or payment for these services. Delays may result from such factors as changes by payors to data submission requirements, requests by fiscal intermediaries for additional data or ----- documentation, disputes over payments owed and other payor issues or information system problems. Many of the states in which we operate may in the future delay reimbursement, which would adversely affect our liquidity. In particular, some of the states in which we operate are operating with budget deficits for the 2024 fiscal year and fiscal year 2025 state budgets could be impacted to the extent economic conditions in the United States are challenging in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, from time to time, procedural issues require us to resubmit claims before payment is remitted, which contributes to our aged receivables. Additionally, unanticipated delays in receiving reimbursement from state programs due to changes in their policies or billing or audit procedures may adversely impact our liquidity and working capital. Working capital management, including prompt and diligent billing and collection, is an important factor in our results of operations and liquidity. Our working capital management procedures may not successfully negate this risk. We, our patients, and our third-party service providers have been the victims of the threat of cybersecurity attacks and security breaches in the past. On February 21, 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group that acts as an intermediary for processing certain payment claims we submit through certain third-party revenue cycle management solutions for payors (“third-party vendors”), notified our third-party vendors of a cybersecurity incident. In response to the incident, both our third-party vendors and Change Healthcare severed the service connections between their respective systems. The Change Healthcare incident did not affect our operations, except our ability to submit payment claims through these particular third-party vendors. No security measures, procedures, technology or amount of preparation can provide guaranteed protection from these threats, or ensure that we, our patients and our third-party service providers will not be victims again in the future. Similar events, like the cyber-attack described above, may occur again in the future. See “—Risks Related to Data Security and Privacy—A cyber-attack or security breach could cause a loss of confidential data, including personal information, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, common law and other legal theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation and otherwise be disruptive to our business.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.13,Previously completed or future acquisitions and new office openings may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.,"Our growth strategy includes the potential acquisition of targets to complement our organic growth. From January 1, 2021 through August 31, 2024, we completed 25 acquisitions and our dedicated business development team has a robust pipeline of future acquisition targets. If we are unable to finance future acquisitions or identify suitable acquisition targets, or if regulatory impediments delay or affect our efforts to complete future acquisitions, we may not be able to continue growing our business. Regulatory scrutiny of acquisitions and consolidations in our industry is high and may continue to increase, and could jeopardize our ability to execute our strategy. We have acquired, and may acquire, companies and operations that extend or complement our existing business. Acquisitions we have consummated in the past, as well as future acquisitions, involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties assimilating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees or clients of acquired providers, regulatory risks, the assumption of liabilities, exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired providers and the diversion of the management team’s attention. In addition, our due diligence review of acquired businesses may not successfully identify all potential issues. Further, following completion of an acquisition, we may not be able to generate expected cost savings and synergies or maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that we and the acquired business have achieved or might achieve separately. The failure to effectively integrate future acquisitions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Should an unknown liability emerge following an acquisition, it could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. As with most acquisitions in our industry, in our prior acquisitions we have paid a premium in excess of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed which have been recorded on our books as goodwill. We may be required to account for similar premiums paid on future acquisitions in the same manner. Goodwill is carried on our books at its original value, subject to annual review and evaluation for impairment, whereas finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the life of the asset. If market and economic conditions (including business valuation levels and trends) deteriorate, we may have to record impairment charges to the extent the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets exceeds their respective fair value. Additionally, if existing GAAP were modified to require amortization, such impairment charges or amortization expense could adversely affect our net earnings during the period in which the charge or expense is recorded. We had $424.8 million and $380.8 million of goodwill and $317.1 million and $346.6 million of intangible assets, net as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We did not record any impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded impairment charges of $53.6 million. Any failure to ----- successfully integrate our acquisitions or a change to existing GAAP goodwill and intangible asset accounting policies could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we and the companies we acquire are involved in various litigation matters and investigations from time to time that expose us to financial liabilities and other consequences. For example, we are involved in settlement negotiations relating to the New York Acquisition discussed in “Business—Legal Proceedings,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 13 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. Such liabilities, when paid, may be material to us in any given fiscal period and to our business as a whole. To a limited extent, we have grown our business opportunistically by establishing new (“de novo”) office locations and we may in the future selectively open new offices in existing and new states. Opening de novo locations involve risks, including those relating to licensing, accreditation and payor program enrollment, hiring new personnel, establishing relationships with referral sources and delays or difficulty in installing our operating and information systems. We may not be successful in generating sufficient business activity to sustain the operating costs of such de novo locations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Any real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. We present key performance indicators, such as organic net service revenue growth, which is calculated using internal data, based on certain approximations of revenue generated from acquired and disposed businesses. We also present certain acquired revenue information for completed acquisitions, which is calculated based on information available upon completion of the applicable acquisition and in certain cases is based on management’s estimate of the historical revenue of the acquired business. In addition, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA gives effect to net income associated with completed acquisitions as if each such acquisition had occurred on the first day of the period presented. We also track our NPS, which is a self-reported metric and not independently verified by any third party. We periodically review and refine some of our methodologies for monitoring, gathering and calculating these metrics. While our metrics are based on what we believe to be reasonable measurements and methodologies, there are inherent challenges in deriving our metrics and they are based on a number of assumptions that may not prove to be correct.

COVID-19 continues to evolve, and we may not be able to predict or effectively respond to future developments and any such developments could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The extent of any ongoing and future impact will depend on, among other factors, the duration and severity of any severe or widespread outbreaks of COVID-19; the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of medical treatments and vaccines; the impact of any mutations of the virus; and the impact of COVID-19 and related government actions on the healthcare industry and broader economy. Moreover, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government authorized financial relief for eligible healthcare providers through the Provider Relief Fund. Although recipients are not required to repay funding received, provided that they attest to and comply with certain terms and conditions, changes to interpretations of guidance on the underlying terms and conditions may result in derecognition of amounts previously received. We received amounts from the Provider Relief Fund and either returned or recorded a liability for any unused funds. We have also acquired and may in the future acquire companies that received funds from the Provider Relief Fund. We believe we have structured our use of these funds in accordance with the terms and conditions. However, we may be subject to or incur costs from related government actions including payment recoupment, audits and inquiries by governmental authorities, and criminal, civil or administrative penalties. In addition, if a future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to affect our markets, our business could be adversely affected. Any such crisis could diminish public trust in healthcare providers, particularly those that are treating or have treated patients affected by contagious diseases. Patient volumes may decline or volumes of uninsured and underinsured patients may increase, depending on the economic circumstances surrounding the pandemic, epidemic or outbreak. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak could adversely impact our business by causing a temporary shutdown or difficulty accessing patients, particularly facility-based patients, by causing disruption or delays in supply chains for materials and products, or by causing staffing shortages. Although we have contingency plans in place, including infection control plans, the potential impact of, as well as the public’s response and governmental responses to, any such future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of infectious disease with respect to our markets is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business and future results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Our employees may also be at greater risk of contracting contagious diseases due to their increased exposure to ----- vulnerable consumers. Due to the physical proximity required to offer many of our services, our employees could have difficulty attending to our consumers if social distancing policies or quarantines are instituted in response to a public health emergency. In addition, we may expand existing internal policies in a manner that may have a similar effect. If another pandemic occurs, we could again suffer losses to our consumer population or a reduction in the availability of our employees.

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement,13.2.1,"Reductions in reimbursement by third-party payors and other changes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal, state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our revenues, profits and profitability.","A significant portion of our net service revenues are derived from government healthcare programs, primarily Medicaid. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we derived approximately 32% of our net service revenues from state, local and other government programs and 67% of our net service revenues from MCOs, both of which were primarily from state Medicaid programs. However, changes in government healthcare programs may decrease the reimbursement we receive or limit access to, or utilization of, our services. The Medicaid program, which is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, is often a state’s largest healthcare program. Governmental agencies generally condition their agreements upon a sufficient budgetary appropriation. Almost all of the states in which we operate have experienced periodic financial pressures and budgetary shortfalls due to challenging economic conditions and the rising costs of healthcare, among other factors. Reductions to federal support for state Medicaid or other programs could also result in budgetary shortfalls. As a result, some states have made, are considering or may consider making changes in their Medicaid or other state and local medical and social programs, including enacting legislation designed to reduce Medicaid expenditures. Our business is also affected by continuing efforts of payors to maintain or reduce costs of healthcare by lowering payment rates, narrowing the scope of covered services, increasing case management review of services and negotiating pricing. Changes that may occur at the federal or state level to contain costs include, for example: ###### • limiting increases in, or decreasing, reimbursement rates; • redefining eligibility standards or coverage criteria for social and medical programs or the receipt of services under those programs; ###### • increasing consumer responsibility, including through increased co-payment requirements; • decreasing benefits, such as limiting the number of hours of personal care services that will be covered; • changing reimbursement methodology and program participation eligibility; • slowing payments to providers; • increasing utilization of self-directed care alternatives operating without agency-based providers; • increasing focus on “all inclusive” programs such as the Program of All-Inclusive Care for The Elderly; and ###### • implementing demonstration projects and alternative payment models. Certain of these measures have been implemented by, or are proposed in, states in which we operate. For example, we provide administrative and support services as a fiscal intermediary to the CDPAP. The CDPAP continues to be a focus for changes by New York governmental authorities. For example, the state of New York’s April 2024 budget requires the administration of the CDPAP to move to a single statewide FI model by April 2025. The statewide FI, which will be selected by the NYSDOH, will be able to subcontract with several entities to facilitate the delivery of FI services. All service providers ----- seeking to offer services under CDPAP will be required to contract with the statewide FI or its contractors in order to offer services. We are currently not seeking to be selected as the single statewide fiscal intermediary and it is not possible at this time to assess the likelihood of becoming a subcontractor or the financial terms of any such arrangement. However, if the statewide fiscal intermediary is adopted, we have strategies that we currently believe could potentially mitigate the economic impact of the current proposal to 5% or less of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. However, it is difficult to predict the details of the implementation and final timeline of the single statewide fiscal intermediary plan, and although we currently do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our business as a whole, the potential discontinuation of CDPAP in New York could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations and, in particular, could significantly impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. Our assessment of the impact of these changes on our business are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, which are subject to change, and there are a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks posed by the New York legislation if implemented. We estimate that CDPAP represented approximately 11% of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we derived approximately 32%, 31% and 22% of our net service revenues from services provided in New York, Illinois and Pennsylvania, respectively. Because a substantial portion of our business is concentrated in these states, any significant reduction in expenditures that pay for our services or other significant changes in these states may have a disproportionately negative impact on our future operating results. We cannot predict whether states material to our operating results will experience changes or other challenges that negatively impact our ability to be reimbursed for our services in a timely manner. Changes in the volume of uninsured patients could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. In recent years, federal and state legislatures have considered or passed various proposals impacting the size of the uninsured population. For example, Medicaid enrollment increased as a result of COVID-19 relief legislation that authorized a temporary increase in federal funds for certain Medicaid expenditures in states that maintained continuous Medicaid enrollment, among other requirements. The end of the continuous enrollment condition in 2023, including the resumption of redeterminations for Medicaid enrollees, has resulted in significant coverage disruptions and disenrollments of enrollees, and Medicaid enrollment is generally expected to decline through fiscal year 2024 (which ended on June 30, 2024, in most states) and continue declining through the remainder of the year. While we believe the population served in our home care model will be less affected than other Medicaid enrollees due to eligibility criteria, there is uncertainty regarding how enrollment will ultimately change as unwinding continues and states return to normal eligibility and enrollment operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.2,Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement,13.2.2,"Changes to existing government healthcare programs and healthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to profitably offer our services and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.","In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes, many of which have been aimed at reducing costs and government spending. The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws affecting the healthcare industry, including laws intended to impact access to health insurance. The most prominent of these legislative reform efforts, the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed and expanded health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. However, the ACA has been, and continues to be, subject to legislative and regulatory changes and court challenges. It is possible that changes by the U.S. Congress or government agencies could eliminate or alter provisions beneficial to us, while leaving in place provisions reducing our reimbursement or otherwise negatively impacting our business. Other recent reform initiatives and proposals at the federal and state levels include those focused on price transparency and value-based pricing, which may impact our competitive position, patient volumes and the relationships between providers, patients and payors. In addition, among other consumer protections, the No Surprises Act imposes various requirements on providers and health plans that are intended to prevent “surprise” medical bills. The law generally requires providers to send an insured patient’s health plan a good faith estimate of expected charges, including billing and diagnostic codes, prior to when the patient is scheduled to receive the item or service. Our revenue is partially dependent on HCBS waiver programs in the states in which we operate, and the requirements for coverage and reimbursement rates offered under these programs are subject to legislative and regulatory changes at the state and federal levels. Under Section 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, states may apply for and implement HCBS waivers, which are reviewed by CMS under federal guidelines, to expand Medicaid coverage for long-term care supports and services in home or community settings rather than institutional settings. While states are given flexibility in designing HCBS waiver programs, the scope of implementation of these programs is driven in part by budgetary and political considerations at the ----- state level. For example, budgetary pressures on state governments could affect the timing of implementation or could result in changes to the scope of eligibility, level of provider or caregiver reimbursement for services and the amount of funding made available for HCBS waiver programs, any of which could affect our ability to offer services profitably. In addition, while federal government spending associated with HCBS waiver programs has increased in recent years, there can be no guarantee that such support will continue. Some states also use or have applied to use Medicaid waivers granted by CMS under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act to implement Medicaid demonstration projects that expand the availability of certain services, impose different eligibility or enrollment restrictions or otherwise implement programs that vary from federal standards. These demonstration projects, which must be budget neutral to the federal government, may be approved for an initial 5-year term and can be extended for additional periods if approved by CMS. Former CMS administrators have indicated that they intend to increase state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid programs, and states have continued to explore payment and delivery reform initiatives, including beneficiary work requirements and quality of care incentives. However, it is unclear whether this trend toward encouraging state flexibility in the administration of Medicaid, including through the use of Section 1115 waivers, will continue under future administrations. In addition, CMS administrators may make changes to Medicaid payment models or impose new limitations on the use of Medicaid funds. For example, in April 2024, CMS announced a final rule (CMS 2442-F Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services) intended to improve access to services and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries across fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems. The final rule includes significant provisions related to HCBS, including the “80/20” or “payment adequacy” requirement, which will require states to ensure that at least 80% of all Medicaid payments a provider receives for homemaker, home health aide and personal care services, less certain excluded costs, under specified programs are spent on total compensation (including benefits) for direct care workers furnishing these services, rather than administrative overhead or profit, subject to limited exceptions. States are required to ensure compliance with the 80/20 requirement by mid-2030. The final rule made a number of technical changes to the definitions used in calculating compliance that clarified or narrowed the revenue covered by the calculation and clarified or expanded the payments to workers that are counted in satisfying the requirement, which combined to make compliance less onerous to providers. The final rule includes several other measures intended to promote transparency and enhance quality and access to services, including a variety of reporting requirements for states. We believe there is the potential for further changes to the rule given the long implementation period, the potential for litigation, administration changes, further rule-making and state changes in response to the final rule. However, based on our regulatory assessment, we do not currently believe that the final rule will have a meaningful impact on our business. Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has also increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. States implementing managed Medicaid programs usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. Other industry participants, such as private payors, may also introduce financial or delivery system reforms. We are unable to predict the nature and success of such initiatives. The upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections have created regulatory uncertainty, including with respect to the U.S. government’s role, in the U.S. healthcare industry. As a result of such elections, there are renewed and reinvigorated calls for health insurance reform, which could cause significant uncertainty in the U.S. healthcare market, could increase our costs, decrease our revenues or inhibit our ability to offer our services. For instance, New York law limits the number of home care providers with which a managed Medicaid long-term care plan can contract. Our contracts with government payors and other government counterparties could also be impacted by changes in spending priorities and political pressures. We cannot predict with certainty what impact any U.S. federal and state health reforms or other changes in federal and state healthcare programs will have on us, but such changes could impose new and/ or more stringent regulatory requirements on our activities or result in reduced reimbursement for our services, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Changes in the reimbursement regime for Medicaid could negatively impact our business. For example, the government is transitioning Medicaid beneficiaries to MCOs. While this transition creates opportunities for us, it also poses risks to our business. ----- Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans is growing, as states are increasingly relying on MCOs to deliver Medicaid program services as a strategy to control costs and manage resources. We may experience increased competition for MCO contracts due to state regulation and limitations. For instance, New York law limits the number of home care providers with which a managed Medicaid long-term care plan can contract. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts to be included in plan networks, that we will be able to secure favorable contracts with all or some of these MCOs, that our reimbursement under these programs will remain at current levels, that the authorizations for services will remain at current levels or that our profitability will remain at levels consistent with past performance. In addition, operational processes may not be well defined as a state transitions beneficiaries to managed care. For example, membership and the related authorization for services to be provided may be delayed, which may result in delays in service delivery to clients or in payment for services rendered. Difficulties with operational processes may negatively affect our revenue growth rates, cash flow and profitability for services provided. Other alternative payment models may be presented by the government and commercial payors that subject us to financial risk. We cannot predict at this time the nature of any such alternative payment models and what effect such models may have on us.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

From time to time, we may also become subject to new or different licensing requirements due to legislative or regulatory requirements developments or changes in its business, and such developments may cause us to make further changes in its business, the results of which may be material. Our failure to acquire or maintain appropriate licensure for our operations, facilities and providers could result in interruptions in our operations, require us to make refunds to state or federal payors, subject us to additional sanctions or fines or impair our ability to serve Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries in markets in which we currently operate, any of which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Our ability to expand operations in a state will depend, where required, on our ability to obtain a state license to operate, and in some cases, CON approval. States may limit the number of licenses they issue. The failure to obtain any required CON or license could impair our ability to operate or expand our business. In addition some states require disclosures by healthcare entities to state attorneys general or other designated entities in advance of sales or other transactions. Many states have enacted CON laws that require prior state approval to offer new or expanded healthcare services or open new healthcare facilities or expand services at existing facilities. In such states, expansion by existing providers or entry into the market by new providers is permitted only where a given amount of unmet need exists, resulting either from population increases or a reduction in competing providers. These states ration the entry of new providers or services and the expansion of existing providers or services in their markets through a CON process, which is periodically evaluated and updated as required by applicable state law. Our costs of obtaining a CON in any new CON state in which we seek to operate could be significant, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the CONs or other required approvals in the future. Our failure or inability to obtain a required CON, license or any necessary approvals could adversely affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets. Furthermore, if a CON or other prior approval upon which we relied to invest in a healthcare center or other facility were to be revoked or lost through an appeal process, we may not be able to recover the value of our investment. In the past, CMS has limited enrollment of new agencies and we cannot predict whether any state may adopt a Medicaid moratorium. Additionally, CMS and state Medicaid agencies may, for a period of time, impose other moratoria against additional Medicaid enrollment for a particular type of service, upon a determination that a moratorium is necessary to prevent fraud, waste or abuse, or to limit an over-abundance of a type of Medicaid provider within a state. Over the years, CMS has repeatedly renewed and extended the moratorium to the entire states of Florida, Illinois, Michigan and Texas. ----- A moratorium in any state in which we seek to, or currently, operate may prevent us from introducing, or disposing of, operations in that state, which may impair our future expansion or divestiture opportunities. If another moratorium is imposed on enrollment of new providers in a geographic area we desire to service, our ability to expand operations may be impacted. The increasingly challenging regulatory environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire healthcare businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues. Resolving any such issues and completing applicable review or approval processes could significantly delay or prevent us from acquiring other businesses and increase our acquisition costs. Approximately 15 states have enacted state material healthcare transaction notification laws that may impact our ability to expand or engage in acquisitive activity in those states. Some states, like Illinois, only require notification of certain healthcare transactions or affiliations 30 days prior to the closing of such arrangements while other states require covered parties to make a filing 180 days before the closing of certain transactions which may result in state regulators imposing conditions or restrictions on the transaction. These laws may materially delay certain expansion efforts and may allow certain state regulators to block our transactions. Additionally, more states may adopt similar rules or rules could become more onerous, any of which could impose delays and impede our growth strategy. The California legislature passed a bill in August 2024 (CA AB 3129) that (i) grants the California Attorney General certain consent rights over transactions involving certain private parties and healthcare professionals and (ii) prohibits customary administrative arrangements between certain types of management companies and healthcare professionals. The Governor of California is expected to sign the bill into law at the end of September 2024. The law is expected to go into effect on January 1, 2025. While we do not currently operate in California, other states may consider similar laws and we may become subject to California laws in the future.

Reimbursement claims made by healthcare providers to government healthcare programs are subject to audit from time to time by governmental payors and their agents, such as private contractors which, among other things, process and pay claims or audits and reviews otherwise directed by state Medicaid agencies, Medicaid fraud control units or by CMS. To ensure compliance with Medicaid, Medicare and other regulations, government agencies or their contractors conduct audits and request client records and other documents in the ordinary course of business to support our claims submitted for payment of services rendered and to ensure compliance with government program requirements. Negative audit findings or allegations of fraud or abuse may subject us or its individual subsidiaries to liability, such as overpayment liability, refunds or recoupments of previously paid claims, payment suspension or the revocation of billing or payment privileges in governmental healthcare programs. If CMS or a state Medicaid agency determines that our actions present an undue risk of fraud, waste or abuse, they may suspend the billing or payment privileges of the entity, deny the entity’s enrollment or revalidation for Medicaid or Medicare participation and potentially deny the re-enrollments of other commonly owned entities. Medicaid MCOs also engage in audits and reviews of previously submitted claims in the ordinary course of business. Negative audit findings by MCOs may result in the imposition of limitations on new client intakes or termination of participation agreements in certain circumstances. Such actions, if imposed on us or our subsidiaries, could materially and adversely impact our revenue, financial condition and results of operations. In many instances, there are only limited publicly-available guidelines and methodologies for determining errors with certain audits. Moreover, auditors’ interpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation, which can lead to a significant lack of clarity regarding required documentation and audit methodology and can increase individual provider and industry-wide perceived error rates. High error rates could lead to further audit activity and regulatory burdens, and could result in our making significant refunds and other payments to government agencies, or MCOs. Accordingly, our future revenues and cash flows from government healthcare programs may be reduced. Private payors also may conduct audits and may take legal action to recover alleged overpayments. We could be adversely affected in some of the markets in which we operate if an auditing payor alleges substantial overpayments were made to us due to lack of documentation or other deficiencies in compliance with reimbursement requirements.

While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for violations of HIPAA, its standards have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. Numerous other state and federal laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality, security and processing of personal information, including health-related information, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Further, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach and other privacyrelated cases as unfair or deceptive acts or practices under the FTC Act. According to the FTC, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Additionally, we may enable third-party tracking pixels on our websites to amass, analyze and infer information about user activity on such sites. Integrating pixels may lead to increased privacy and security risks. The FTC and HHS Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) have interpreted that the information tracked by or obtained by tracking pixels may include health information and other forms of sensitive data and have indicated the use of tracking pixels without the proper disclosures and consents as a potential enforcement priority. We use tracking technologies and attempt to comply with applicable laws; however, the FTC and OCR may take an expansive view of what information tracked would be considered health information under the applicable laws. We expect federal privacy laws to continue to evolve. In addition, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted breach notification laws that may require us to notify clients, employees or regulators in the event of unauthorized access to or disclosure of personal or confidential information experienced by us or our service providers. Such laws data breach notification laws that impose, in varying degrees, an obligation to notify affected persons or state regulators in the event of a data breach or compromise, including when their personal information has or may have been accessed by an unauthorized person. Violation of state privacy, security and breach notification laws can trigger significant monetary penalties. These laws are not consistent, and compliance in the ----- event of a widespread data breach is difficult and may be costly. Although we may have contractual protections with our service providers, any actual or perceived security breach could harm our reputation and brand, expose us to potential liability or require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to any such actual or perceived breach. Any contractual protections we may have from our service providers may not be sufficient to adequately protect us from any such liabilities and losses, and we may be unable to enforce any such contractual protections. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups have and may in the future propose self-regulatory standards from time to time. These and other industry standards may legally or contractually apply to us, or we may elect to comply with such standards. A number of states are passing statutes that regulate the acquisition, use and storage of biometric information, such as fingerprints and eye scans. New technology introduced into the workplace may seek to use an individual’s biometrical markers or data. States, employees and clients may pursue actions under such statutes to enforce their rights, which could result in fines and may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. This complex, dynamic legal landscape regarding privacy, data protection, data analytics and information security creates significant compliance issues for us and potentially exposes us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. We are currently in the process of developing and updating our policies and procedures in accordance with requirements under applicable data privacy and protection laws and regulations. Given the rapid development of data protection, privacy and security laws and regulations, we expect to encounter inconsistent interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations, as well as frequent changes to these laws and regulations which may expose us to significant penalties or liability for non-compliance, the possibility of fines, lawsuits (including class action privacy litigation), regulatory investigations, criminal or civil sanctions, audits, adverse media coverage, public censure, other claims, significant costs for remediation and damage to our reputation or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, recently a third-party after-hours phone services vendor informed us that it discovered an incident on its network resulting in the potential access and acquisition of certain data. An initial investigation revealed that the vendor’s network was breached and infiltrated, thereby allowing the threat actor access to our caregiver and client information that had been improperly downloaded by the vendor; however, our systems and network were not breached or infiltrated. See “Business—Legal Proceedings” for more information. Any inability to adequately address data protection, privacy and security-related concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations, standards and other obligations relating to data protection, privacy and security, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our relationships with clients and have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have implemented data privacy and security measures in an effort to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to data protection, privacy and security, some PHI or other personal information or confidential information is transmitted to us by third parties or from us to third parties, who may not implement adequate security and privacy measures, and it is possible that laws, rules and regulations relating to privacy, data protection or information security may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices or those of third parties who transmit PHI and other personal information or confidential information to us. If we or these third parties are found to have violated such laws, rules or regulations, it could result in government-imposed fines, orders requiring that we or these third parties change our or their practices or criminal charges, which could adversely affect our business. Complying with these various laws and regulations, with laws and regulations to which we may become subject when we expand our business and with any new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, systems and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business, divert resources from other initiatives and projects and restrict our use of data, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. We make public statements about our use and disclosure of personal information through our privacy policies, information provided on our website and press statements. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about data privacy and security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices. Any concerns about our data privacy and security practices, even if unfounded, could damage the reputation of our businesses, discourage potential clients from receiving our services and have a material adverse effect on our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Our operations may be disrupted if we or our service providers are unable to effectively manage and maintain the security of our and their information systems.","Our business depends on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, gathering information to improve the quality of client care, optimizing financial performance, adjusting client mix, monitoring ----- regulatory compliance and enhancing staff efficiency. We rely on external service providers to provide continual maintenance, upgrading and enhancement of our primary information systems used for our operational needs. The software we license for our various client information systems supports intake, personnel scheduling, office clinical and centralized billing and receivables management in an integrated database, enabling us to standardize the care delivered across our network of offices and monitor our performance and client outcomes. Our business also depends on a comprehensive payroll and human resources system for basic payroll functions and reporting, payroll tax reporting, managing wage assignments and garnishments. Information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts or natural disasters. Our business supports electronic visit verification (“EVV”), to electronically collect visit information when our caregivers and providers deliver home care services. Our solution uses a combination of instant voice response and GPS enabled smartphones to capture time in and time out, mileage and travel time, as well as the completed care plan tasks. We license this software through various external service providers and partner with states that utilize other software. We rely on these service vendors to provide continual maintenance and enhancements, as well as security of any protected data. To the extent that our EVV vendors fail to support these processes, our internal operations could be negatively affected. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, states must require the use of EVV for all Medicaid- funded personal care services and home health services that require an in-home visit by a provider. States that failed to meet the deadlines for implementation may be subject to incremental reductions in federal funding, absent approval of a good faith exemption. If any states in which we operate, fail to properly and timely implement EVV and lose an amount of their funding or to the extent states adopt standards for EVV that are not compatible with our operations, our internal operations could be negatively affected. Further, to the extent that the EVV solutions that we use are determined to be noncompliant with federal or state EVV requirements, we could be subject to penalties. To the extent service providers fail to support the software or systems we use, or if we lose our licenses, our operations could be negatively affected. Further, any performance issues, errors, bugs or defects in third-party software, content or services could result in errors or a failure of our internal operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the future, we might need to license other software, content or services to enhance our operational needs and meet evolving client demands and requirements. Any limitations in our ability to use third-party software, content or services could significantly increase our expenses and otherwise result in delays, a reduction in functionality or errors or failures of our operational needs until equivalent technology or content is, if available, identified, obtained through purchase or licensed and integrated into our operations. In addition, third-party licenses may expose us to increased risks, including risks associated with the integration and security of new technology, which may increase our expenses and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The key business functions for our main sites also have redundancies with key functions geographically split between our two main facilities, should one not be available due to the above mentioned scenarios. While we believe these measures are reasonable, no system of information security is able to eliminate the risk of business disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a substantial increase in administrative employees working remotely and, consequently, accessing our system remotely. As a result, we are more dependent on our systems that facilitate remote access and potentially could experience increased risks. If we or our service providers experience a reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of our or their information systems, our operations and ability to process transactions and produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. We do not have control over the security measures or operations of the service providers that we use, and their information systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. If we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement, maintain or expand our systems properly, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses. If any of our systems, or those of our service providers, are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

We frequently exchange clinical and financial data with third parties in connection with our routine operations and in order to meet our contractual and regulatory obligations. We are required to comply with the federal and state data protection, privacy and security laws and requirements, including HIPAA. In addition, various states, including Illinois and New York have enacted, and other states are expected to enact, laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and information security. If our privacy and security practices fail to comply with HIPAA and other applicable data protection, privacy and security laws or if we fail to satisfy applicable breach notification requirements in the event of a security breach, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, lawsuits and reputational harm. Such attacks or breaches could result in loss of protected client medical data or other information subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information technology (“IT”) systems or business. In addition, we may be at increased risk because we outsource certain services or functions to, or have systems that interface with, third parties. Some of these third parties may store or have access to our data and may not have effective controls, processes or practices to protect our information from attack, damage or unauthorized access. A breach or attack, including those caused by updates and other releases, affecting any of these third parties could harm our business. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational systems (or those of our service providers), or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations (or those of our service providers), has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world. Such threats to our IT systems and data security can take a variety of forms. Hackers may develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack our networks and data centers or those of our service providers. Additionally, unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of our service providers, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our or their employees or contractors, direct social engineering, phishing, credential stuffing, ransomware, denial or degradation of service attacks and similar types of attacks against any or all of us, our clients and our service providers. Other threats include inadvertent security breaches or theft, misuse, unauthorized access or other improper actions by our employees, clients, service providers and other business partners. We and our service providers have been the target of cyber-attack attempts and have experienced certain security incidents, including a recent breach of one of our vendor’s networks resulting in a threat actor gaining access to certain caregiver and client information. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.” To date, such identified security incidents have not had a material effect on us, including to our reputation or business operations, or had a material financial impact, but there can be no assurance that present or future cyber-attacks will not be material or significant. Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of cybersecurity attacks and other security-related incidents, our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health information and personally identifiable information we maintain in our databases and there can be no assurance that any security procedures and controls that we or our service providers have implemented will be sufficient to prevent such incidents from occurring. Furthermore, because the methods of attack and deception change frequently, are increasingly complex and sophisticated and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as service providers and even nation-state actors, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect, appropriately react and respond to, or implement effective preventative measures against, all cybersecurity attacks and other security-related incidents. Additionally, our ability to monitor our service providers’ data security is limited. A vulnerability in our service provider’s software or systems, a failure of our service providers’ safeguards, policies or procedures or a breach of a service provider’s software or systems could result in the compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our systems or the data housed in our service providers’ solutions. In addition, service providers may improperly store our confidential information on their systems without our knowledge or otherwise expose our information to threat actors. Despite efforts by us and our service providers to develop, implement and maintain security measures, we or our service providers may not be successful in preventing these events from any network, and information systems-related events could require us to expend significant resources to remedy such event. In the future, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities. Any failure, compromise, breach or interruption in our systems, or those of our service providers, which may result from problems such as malware, computer viruses, cyberattacks, hacking attempts or other third-party malfeasance, or any failure to defend against or otherwise prevent a cybersecurity attack or breach, could result in a disruption of our operations, client dissatisfaction, a loss of clients or revenues and damage to our reputation or brand with our clients, referral sources, payors ----- or other third parties and could subject us to substantial sanctions, fines and damages and other additional civil and criminal penalties under HIPAA. In spite of our policies, procedures and other security measures used to protect our computer systems and data, occasionally, we have experienced breaches that have required us to notify affected individuals and the government, and we have worked with our clients and the government to resolve such issues. While these past breaches have not had a significant adverse impact on our business or results of operations, there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to additional or more severe cyber-attacks or security breaches in the future. The occurrence of any actual or attempted cybersecurity attack or other security-related incident, the reporting of such an incident, whether accurate or not, or our failure to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols, could result in liability to our clients or regulators, which could result in significant fines, litigation penalties, orders, sanctions, adverse publicity, litigation or actions against us or our service providers by governmental bodies and other regulatory authorities, clients or third parties, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Any such proceeding or action, any related indemnification obligation, even if we are not held liable, and any resulting negative publicity, could harm our business, damage our reputation, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of these proceedings, increase the costs of conducting our business, distract the attention of management or result in the imposition of financial liability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

We would also have had $250.0 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, all of which would have been secured on an equal priority basis with the notes. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences for you as a holder of the notes. For example, it could: - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations; - increase our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry and competitive conditions; - limit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate requirements; - expose us to interest rate fluctuations because borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear interest at variable rates; - require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing funds available to us for other purposes; - make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults and crossdefaults on, and acceleration and cross-acceleration of, our outstanding indebtedness; - limit our ability to refinance indebtedness or increase the associated costs; - require us to sell assets to reduce debt or influence our decision about whether to do so; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any competitors that have less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns. ----- In addition, the indenture governing the notes and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will contain restrictive covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

In addition, the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will require us to meet a minimum first lien net leverage ratio under certain circumstances. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the indenture governing the notes and the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may be affected by economic conditions and by financial, market and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the indenture governing the notes or the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities that would permit the holders or applicable lenders to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest and any applicable redemption premium. In addition, or in the alternative, the applicable lenders or agents could exercise their rights under the security documents to be entered into in connection with the notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, to repay the notes or our Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan Facility when they mature or become due, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as refinancing or restructuring our debt, selling assets or operations, reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more restrictive covenants that could further restrict our business operations and our subsidiaries’ ability to make cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise, to enable us to repay the amounts due under the notes. Our ability to implement successfully any such alternative financing plans will be dependent on a range of factors, including general economic conditions, the level of activity in capital markets generally and the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and holders the notes could elect to declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities could declare all outstanding borrowings to be due and payable and terminate their commitments to loan money, our secured lenders could foreclose against the assets securing such indebtedness and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.

As a result, liquidating the collateral securing the notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the notes. Our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be secured by the collateral ratably with our obligations under the notes. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors, foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, or following acceleration of our indebtedness or an event of default under our indebtedness, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be entitled to be repaid from the proceeds of the collateral ratably with any payment made to holders of the notes from such proceeds. In addition, the terms of the indenture governing the notes will permit, subject to certain limitations, the incurrence of additional debt that may be secured on a firstpriority basis with respect to the collateral, which other debt will similarly be entitled to be repaid from the proceeds of the collateral ratably with any payment made to the holders of the notes from such proceeds. The fair market value of the collateral securing the notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of our industry, the ability to sell the collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, some or all of the collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the notes. In addition, in the event of any such proceeding, the ability of the holders of the notes to realize upon any of the collateral would generally be subject to applicable bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations. See “—Bankruptcy laws may limit the ability of holders of the notes to realize value from the collateral.” In addition, the security interests of the Notes Collateral Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in collateral. For example, the Notes Collateral Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the Notes Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Also, certain items included in the collateral, such as licenses and ----- other permits, may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and therefore the Notes Collateral Agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure. The collateral is subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the Bank Collateral Agent or other representatives of the respective obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities from time to time. These exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections may be significant.

Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, any actions that may be taken with respect to such collateral, including the ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against such collateral and to control such proceedings, will be at the direction of the Bank Collateral Agent until the earlier of (x) the date on which the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are discharged (which discharge does not include certain refinancings of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and (y) 180 days after the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture or any other agreement governing first lien indebtedness subject to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement and acceleration of all obligations thereunder, if the authorized representative of the holders of such indebtedness represents the largest outstanding aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral (other than the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and such authorized representative has complied with the applicable notice provisions. However, even if the Notes Collateral Agent gains the right to direct the exercise of remedies in the circumstances described above, the Notes Collateral Agent must stop doing so (and those powers with respect to collateral would revert to the Bank Collateral Agent) if the Bank Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing enforcement action with respect to the collateral or the grantor of the security interest in that collateral (whether us or the applicable guarantor) is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. At any time that the Bank Collateral Agent does not have the right to take action with respect to the collateral pursuant to the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement as described above, that right passes to the authorized representative of the holders of the then largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a first-priority lien on the collateral. If we issue additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Notes Collateral Agent. Accordingly, the Notes Collateral Agent may never have the right to control remedies and take other actions with respect to the collateral securing the notes. Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes Collateral Agent, the Trustee and the holders of the notes may not object following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to any debtor-in-possession financing that is not opposed or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or to the use of the collateral to secure that financing, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions.

The liens on the collateral securing the notes may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the notes if the Notes Collateral Agent is not able to take the actions necessary to perfect any of these liens on or prior to the date of the indenture governing the notes. We will have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the notes in specified collateral other than the filing of financing statements and intellectual property security agreements and the delivery to the Bank Collateral Agent, as bailee of the Notes Collateral Agent, of certain possessory collateral. To the extent a security interest in certain collateral is not properly perfected on the date of the issuance of the notes and is required to be perfected thereafter, such security interests will be required to ----- be perfected within 90 days of the date of the issuance of the notes (as such period may be extended by the Bank Collateral Agent) and such security interest might be avoidable in bankruptcy, which could impact the value of the collateral. See “— Any future pledge of collateral or guarantee may be avoidable in bankruptcy.” We cannot assure you that we will be able to perfect any such security interests in such time period or at all, and the failure to so perfect such security interests would reduce the amount of collateral that will secure the notes unless and until so perfected. If additional wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are formed or acquired and become guarantors under the indenture that will govern the notes, additional financing statements would be required to be filed to perfect the security interest in the assets of such guarantors. Depending on the type of the assets constituting after-acquired collateral, additional action may also be required to perfect the security interest in such assets. Applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can be perfected only at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be responsible to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral under the indenture governing the notes, and that the necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. None of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral Agent or the Bank Collateral Agent under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will have any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or monitor the perfection of, or make filings to perfect or maintain the perfection of, any security interests therein. Such inaction may result in the loss of the security interest in such collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the notes and the guarantees against third parties. Even if the Notes Collateral Agent does properly perfect liens on collateral acquired or arising in the future, such liens may potentially be avoidable as a preference in any bankruptcy proceeding under certain circumstances.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the notes and the guarantees and the grant of liens will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the notes or guarantees or the grant of liens were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for issuing either the notes or a guarantee or granting the liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - we or any of the guarantors was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of issuing the notes or the guarantees (or the related security interest with respect to the notes or the guarantees); - the issuance of the notes or guarantees (or the granting of the related security interests with respect to the notes or the guarantees) left us or any of the guarantors with an unreasonably small amount of capital to carry on the business or a transaction in which we or such guarantor was engaged or about to engage; or - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or it would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they become due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or a guarantee or the granting of liens was a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or such guarantee (and any related liens) in total or in part or further subordinate the notes or such guarantee to our or such guarantor’s presently existing and future indebtedness, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the notes or such guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the voidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our other debt and that of the guarantors that could result in the acceleration of such debt. ----- The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to: the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were solvent at the relevant time, or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, that it would not determine that we or a guarantor was indeed insolvent on that date; that any payments to the holders of the notes (including under the guarantees) did not constitute preferences, fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers on other grounds; or that the issuance of the notes and the guarantees would not be subordinated to our or any guarantor’s other debt. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, was greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they become due. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. Also, for this analysis, “debts” includes contingent and unliquidated debts. A court would likely find that we or a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the notes or such guarantee (or related liens) if we or such guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes or the applicable guarantee or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the guarantor, the obligations of the applicable guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could void the obligations under the guarantees, subordinate them to the applicable guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the notes. To the extent a court voids any of the guarantees as fraudulent conveyances or fraudulent transfers or holds any of the guarantees unenforceable for any other reason, the holders of notes would cease to have any direct claim against the applicable guarantor. If a court were to hold a guarantee unenforceable, the applicable guarantor’s assets would be applied first to satisfy the applicable guarantor’s other liabilities, if any, and might not be applied to the payment of the guarantee of the notes. Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that you already received from us or the applicable guarantor. Even if the guarantee of a guarantor is not voided as a fraudulent transfer, a court may subordinate the guarantee to that guarantor’s other debt, and in that event, the guarantees would be subordinated (including structurally) to all of that guarantor’s other debt. Although each guarantee entered into in connection with the notes will contain a provision intended to limit that guarantor’s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter or otherwise to protect those guarantees from being avoided, or may reduce that guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless. In addition, as noted above, any payment by us pursuant to the notes or by a guarantor under a guarantee made at a time we or such guarantor was found to be insolvent could be voided and required to be returned to us or such guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of our or such guarantor’s creditors if such payment is made to an insider within a one-year period (or within 90 days for any non-insider party) prior to a bankruptcy filing and such payment would give such insider or noninsider party (as the case may be) more than such creditors would have received in a distribution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case. Finally, as a court of equity, the bankruptcy court may otherwise subordinate the claims in respect of the notes or the guarantees to other claims against us or the guarantors under the principle of equitable subordination, if the court determines that: (i) the holder of the notes engaged in some type of inequitable conduct; ----- (ii) such inequitable conduct resulted in injury to our other creditors or conferred an unfair advantage upon the holder of the notes; and (iii) equitable subordination is not inconsistent with the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Any future pledge of collateral or issuance of a guarantee in favor of the holders of the notes (including any liens delivered or reinstated or pursuant to guarantees delivered in connection therewith after the date the notes are issued) may be avoidable by the pledgor (as a debtor-in-possession) or guarantor (as a debtor-in-possession), by its trustee in bankruptcy, or potentially by other creditors if certain events or circumstances exist or occur, including, among others, if (i) the pledgor or guarantor is insolvent at the time of the pledge or issuance of the guarantee, (ii) the pledge or issuance of the guarantee (as applicable) permits the holders of the notes to receive a greater recovery in a hypothetical Chapter 7 case than if such pledge or guarantee (as applicable) had not been given and (iii) a bankruptcy proceeding in respect of the pledgor or guarantor is commenced within 90 days following the pledge or the perfection thereof or the issuance of the guarantee or, in certain circumstances, a longer period.

Under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor, such as the Notes Collateral Agent, is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security previously repossessed from a debtor, without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). Moreover, bankruptcy law permits the debtor to continue to retain and use collateral (including cash collateral), and the proceeds, products, rents or profits of the collateral, even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection.” The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to the circumstances, but it is intended in general to protect the value of the secured creditor’s interest in its collateral and may include cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such time as the court in its discretion determines, for any diminution in the value of the collateral as a result of the automatic stay of repossession or disposition or any use of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. A bankruptcy court may determine that a secured creditor may not require compensation for a diminution in the value of its collateral if the value of the collateral exceeds the debt it secures. In view of both the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, it is impossible to predict how, whether or when payments under the notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case, the length of the delay in making any such payments or whether any such payment will be made at all or in what form, whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the collateral securing the notes, the value of such collateral as of the commencement date of any bankruptcy proceedings or at any time thereafter, or whether or to what extent or in what form holders of the notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of the value of such collateral through the requirements of “adequate protection” or otherwise. Furthermore, any disposition of the collateral securing the notes during a bankruptcy case outside of the ordinary course of business would also require prior approval from the bankruptcy court (which may not be given under the circumstances). Also, in the event the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the collateral securing the notes is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the notes and all of our other outstanding first-priority obligations, the holders of the notes would be considered “undersecured.” U.S. bankruptcy laws do not provide for the payment or accrual of interest, expenses, costs ----- and attorneys’ fees to a creditor holding “undersecured” claims during a debtor’s bankruptcy case nor is a creditor entitled to adequate protection on account of any undersecured portion of its claims. In addition, as noted above, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will prohibit the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent from objecting following the filing of a bankruptcy petition to proposed debtor-in-possession financing to be provided to us that is secured by the collateral securing the notes or to our use of cash collateral that has not been opposed to or objected to by the controlling collateral agent or the other controlling secured parties, subject to certain conditions and limited exceptions. After such a filing, the value of the collateral securing the notes could materially deteriorate, and holders of the notes would be unable to raise an objection.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Holders of the notes would be deemed to have an unsecured claim to the extent that our obligations in respect of the notes (and all of our other first-priority obligations) exceed the fair market value of the collateral.

Upon a finding by the bankruptcy court that the notes are undercollateralized, the claims in the bankruptcy proceeding with respect to the notes would be bifurcated between a secured claim and an unsecured claim, and the unsecured claim would not be entitled to the benefits of security in the collateral. In such event, the secured claims of the holders of the notes would be limited to the value of the collateral securing the notes. The consequences of a finding of under-collateralization would include, among other things, a lack of entitlement on the part of the holders of the notes to receive post-petition interest, fees and expenses and a lack of entitlement on the part of the unsecured portion of the notes to receive “adequate protection” under federal bankruptcy laws, as discussed above. In addition, if any payments of post-petition interest had been made at the time of such a finding of under- collateralization, those payments could be re-characterized by the bankruptcy court as a reduction of the principal amount of the secured claim with respect to the notes.

These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater development or commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. Even if such licenses are available, in return for the use of a third party’s technology, we may agree to pay the licensor royalties based on sales of our products or services.

In addition to registering material and eligible intellectual property, we rely to a degree on contractual restrictions to prevent others from exploiting our intellectual property rights. However, the enforceability of these provisions is subject to various state and federal laws, and is therefore uncertain.

This material weakness contributed to the above material weaknesses. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized and implemented appropriately. ----- These IT deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness. Each of the control deficiencies could result in a future material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. While we have implemented a plan to remediate these material weaknesses, we cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful, or if successful, the timing of achieving our remediation efforts. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses in our ICFR or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. In the past, we identified an additional material weakness that has since been remediated. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our ICFR, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be negatively impacted, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are a leading healthcare services company focused on delivering high-quality personal care services primarily to elderly individuals with complex chronic medical needs so they can age in place in a cost effective and preferred setting of care – the home. Founded in 1975, we believe we are the largest home care provider in the United States based on revenue derived from personal care services, with net service revenues of $2.15 billion and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $269.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. We operate across 11 states serving approximately 67,000 clients and providing approximately 80 million hours of care in the home on an annualized basis as of June 30, 2024. Help at Home’s mission is To Enable Individuals to Have Great Days with Independence and Dignity at Home and we strive to create a workplace that values Service, Accountability, Integrity, Teamwork and Innovation. We deliver essential care to some of the most vulnerable individuals in our society who have few reliable alternatives to remain independent in their homes. We employ a dedicated care workforce, including approximately 58,000 caregivers as of June 30, 2024, that is trained to provide services and supports for ADL, address HRSN and coordinate care and other services for clients in their homes. Our care workforce performs a wide range of services, including assistance with ambulation, bathing and grooming, medication reminders and closing gaps in care. We believe our care model is highly differentiated within the broader healthcare ecosystem due to our ability to engage clients in a trusted relationship that is characterized by both high frequency of visits and long duration of service, giving us unique perspectives into the complex chronic population we serve. Our Home Care operating segment, which accounted for more than 99% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, provides non-medical personal care services to support ADL for individuals with complex chronic health care needs, such as assistance with ambulation, bathing and grooming and medication reminders. In addition, our frequent and regular interactions with these individuals over the course of an average of approximately four years can create opportunities to improve care through expanded services in a high engagement “Care Coordination” model. We have developed a Care Coordination operating segment (which has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues) with offerings designed to identify and prevent the exacerbation of chronic conditions, help close gaps in care and connect individuals with primary and specialty care. The programs we have developed for Care Coordination are reinforced by strong client engagement through frequent interactions with our caregivers and digital capture of changes in condition by our care teams and are further supported by nurses, community health workers and social workers in a population-based model. We believe our Care Coordination capabilities enhance our Home Care business through increased client and caregiver retention and improved satisfaction. See Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information. In comparison to other in-home based care models, such as skilled nursing and other home health care services that are required to be performed by licensed medical professionals, which tend to be episodic in nature, our home care model is designed to engage complex chronic populations on a longitudinal basis, supporting them continuously with ADL. In 2023, our compassionate caregivers spent an average of 22 hours per week in the homes of the individuals we served, and the average tenure of both clients and caregivers was approximately four years, which we believe is driven by strong satisfaction and high engagement. Our differentiated culture of “Caring for the Caregiver,” in which we emphasize the value of our dedicated caregivers and provide exceptional service to these individuals, has contributed to a 12-month caregiver retention of approximately 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. This compares to an industry-wide median retention rate of ----- approximately 23%, which we believe reflects the broader industry’s use of caregivers on a more episodic basis and diminished emphasis on a long-term trusted partnership between caregivers and clients. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 80% of our clients were dually eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare and, as these complex chronic individuals age, their care needs expand. The services we provide allow these individuals to remain in their homes, helping avoid more costly institutional settings such as skilled nursing facilities, acute care hospitals and other higher-cost institutional sites of care. According to the Genworth Cost of Care Survey in 2023, the average daily cost of nursing home stay is estimated to be between two and three times the daily cost of home care services. Our services are primarily reimbursed on a per hour basis and funded through Medicaid HCBS programs, which are administered by MCOs or state-based agencies. In 2023, 67% of our net service revenues were derived from Medicaid MCOs, 32% were derived from state-based or local agencies that administer Medicaid LTSS programs on behalf of states and the remaining 1% were derived from the VA, private pay and other sources. We had approximately 250 distinct state, local and MCO payor sources as of June 30, 2024 and we believe that the diversity of our payors, as well as widespread governmental and MCO support for the Medicaid HCBS we deliver, provides stability in our business and helps insulate us from significant reductions in the rates we are paid. Rates are primarily based on published Medicaid fee schedules or negotiated directly with third-party payors and in some cases also include additional incentive payments for performance or quality-based metrics, providing us with an opportunity to enhance the economics of our hourly-based reimbursement model. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 0.5% of our net service revenues were derived from pay-for-performance or quality-based arrangements with payor partners. Between calendar years 2021 and 2023, our average annual reimbursement rate per hour increased by 5% on an organic basis (excluding the impact of dispositions and material acquisitions), demonstrating a supportive rate environment across our state and MCO payors. We have experienced broad rate support by these payors within our geographic footprint; the average annual reimbursement rate per hour increase between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 included the following: Delaware (3% average increase), Georgia (5% average increase), Illinois (7% average increase), Indiana (11% average increase), Michigan (16% average increase), Missouri (15% average increase), Mississippi (7% average increase), New York (3% average increase), Ohio (13% average increase) and Pennsylvania (3% average increase). The market in which we operate is large, highly fragmented and growing rapidly. We have been able to capitalize on market trends by generating strong organic growth and supplementing our efforts with accretive acquisitions. From 2021 to 2023, we generated a net service revenue CAGR of 41% and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 44%. Between 2021 and 2023, our average organic net service revenue growth was 10%, we completed 19 acquisitions and we entered four new states. From January 1, 2024 to August 31, 2024, we completed an additional six acquisitions. See “—Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information” for more information about how we calculate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and organic net service revenue growth and “Presentation of Information” for a discussion of how we calculate acquired revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.1,,"Our financial condition and results of operations are affected by a number of important factors, including: - _Ability to grow organically. We operate in a rapidly growing market for home care services, supported by strong demand trends for care in the home due to aging demographics, consumer preferences and the continued shift from traditional Medicaid programs to MLTSS, which typically leads to increased penetration of home care services as compared to higher cost institutional settings. We have historically achieved organic growth through our local market density, scale, reputation, sophistication and commitment to quality. We believe that current trends, including increased requirements around reporting and technology, will benefit us, as our scale allows us to leverage these investments across our business and markets. Further, we employ several strategies to drive our growth organically, including our strategic focus on leading local market positions as well as our operating initiatives, such as recruiting and retention of caregivers, increased client retention, and enhanced payor referrals. If there is a shift in preferences or regulation impacting home care broadly or if we are not able to execute on our strategic initiatives, our ability to drive organic growth would be negatively impacted. - _Changes in reimbursement rates. Our ability to grow and generate profitability largely depends on alignment between the reimbursement we receive from payors and the wages and benefits we pay our caregivers. We have a long history of reimbursement stability with diversified payors and ongoing government support for ----- reimbursement, with average per annum rate growth of approximately 5% over the last three years on an organic basis (adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and material acquisitions). We have historically benefited from stable to positive reimbursement rate increases that tend to track closely with wage inflation, which has allowed us to maintain a stable operating margin historically. In addition, we believe there is widespread support for expanding access to Medicaid home care services for complex, chronic populations like those we serve. There is no assurance that state and MCO payors will continue to support home-based services or provide reimbursement rate increases to mitigate increases in the cost of doing business, particularly higher wages, or that these increases will be timely. Our gross margin may be variable across periods due to timing differences between increases in reimbursement rates and wages. Our financial performance may be adversely impacted for any periods in which reimbursement rates do not increase, particularly if our costs increase. - _Ability to attract and retain caregivers. Our ability to grow and generate profitability also largely depends upon our ability to meet the demands for our services with appropriate levels of high-quality staffing. As of June 30, 2024, our workforce of approximately 58,000 caregivers maintained an average tenure of approximately four years. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had a 12-month caregiver retention rate of approximately 68% and we had client and caregiver NPS of 58 and 41, respectively. Our fully integrated human capital management information systems allow for digital straight through processing of new caregivers from initial interest and recruiting to paycheck. We offer 24/7 client and caregiver call center support with a focus on compliance, quality and responsiveness. There is no assurance that our hiring and retention methods will continue to be successful. We operate in a competitive environment for labor and our ability to offer competitive wage rates is driven largely by regular increases in reimbursement rates. - _Shifting reimbursement landscape. As reimbursement for home care services continues to shift towards MCOs and pay for performance or quality-based reimbursement incentive opportunities, we believe we are a “provider of choice” for our MCO partners. We have developed additional capabilities to enter into value-based arrangements where we can capture enhanced economics from achievement of performance metrics or from the cost savings we deliver. As of June 30, 2024, we maintain MCO relationships across markets with approximately 250 diversified payors. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 68% of our net service revenues were derived from MCO payors. There is no assurance that MCOs will partner with us or that they will direct client referrals to us. - _Ability to sustain operating model competitive advantages. Our size and scale allow us to continue investing in infrastructure, technology resources, quality initiatives and people. Our digitized operating model and centralized and streamlined core business functions provide us with a blend of technology, central efficiency and local presence to drive operating and financial performance. We believe this enables us to deliver higher margins versus our peers and many of our small local competitors, which gives us the ability to fund our investments and achieve superior performance. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue leveraging our scaled operating model effectively. - _Ability to identify compelling acquisition targets. From 2021 through August 31, 2024, we completed 25 acquisitions across the Help at Home platform, deploying $703.3 million in capital. Our dedicated business development team also maintains a robust pipeline of future acquisition targets within a highly fragmented home care market. We estimate that the largest 10 players in the home care market comprise approximately 6% of the total industry expenditures, with the remaining approximately 28,000 providers presenting a significant expansion opportunity. We intend to expand our Home Care presence by capitalizing on our proven ability to identify and execute acquisitions within a highly fragmented market landscape. We believe we are viewed as an acquiror of choice given our culture and operational capabilities and positive reputation earned from nearly 50 years in the business. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow inorganically if we are not able to ----- finance future acquisitions or identify suitable acquisition targets or if state regulatory laws materially delay or impede our efforts to complete future acquisitions.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,New York Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program Regulatory Changes,17.3.1,,"New York’s Medicaid home care program comprises an agency-based model, LHCSA, and a separate alternative self-directed model, CDPAP, which is unique to the New York market. Broadly speaking, under the agency-based model, we recruit and train professional caregivers and match them to clients they are well-suited to serve. Under a self-directed model, consumers choose their own caregiver to serve as a caregiver and receive compensation. In New York’s CDPAP, the chosen caregiver requires what is referred to as a “Fiscal Intermediary,” or “FI,” to act as the employer of record and manage various administrative tasks on behalf of the caregiver, whereas in other states in which we operate we manage self-directed caregivers through the agency-based model. We recognized approximately $375.0 million in net service revenues from the CDPAP program for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, and the program accounted for approximately 11% of our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. Our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 attributable to New York operations was split approximately evenly between the CDPAP and LHCSA models; however, margins from the LHCSA model are higher than CDPAP due to higher MCO rates and quality incentive payments that are available only to LHCSA providers. In an effort to increase accountability and regulate quality, cost reporting, licensure and marketing in connection with CDPAP, in 2019 New York initiated a new RFO process to competitively procure CDPAP FIs, a measure that would ultimately reduce the number of participating providers. However, the New York legislature intervened in 2022, authorizing fiscal intermediary applicants that satisfied certain criteria to continue operating, effectively eliminating the competitive procurement process. CDPAP continues to be a focus for changes by New York governmental authorities. Most recently, the New York fiscal year 2025 budget, which was signed by the governor on April 20, 2024, included a plan to move administration of the CDPAP to a single FI selected by the NYSDOH by April 1, 2025. Under this initiative, all current and future service providers seeking to offer services under CDPAP’s self-directed model would be required to contract directly or indirectly with this single statewide fiscal intermediary. As of the date of this offering memorandum, there is considerable opposition to the statewide fiscal intermediary plan, including ongoing litigation and recently proposed legislation to block its implementation. We are currently not seeking to be selected as the single statewide fiscal intermediary and it is not possible at this time to assess the likelihood of becoming a subcontractor or the financial terms of any such arrangement. However, if the statewide fiscal intermediary is adopted, we have strategies that we currently believe could potentially mitigate the economic impact of the current proposal to 5% or less of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024. However, it is difficult to predict the details of the implementation and final timeline of the single statewide FI, and although we currently do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our business as a whole, the potential discontinuation of the current CDPAP model in New York could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations and, in particular, could significantly impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. Our assessment of the impact of these changes on our business are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, which are subject to change, and there are a variety of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to mitigate the risks posed by the New York legislation if implemented. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement—Reductions in reimbursement by third-party payors and other changes to Medicaid, Medicare and other federal, state and local medical and social programs could adversely affect our revenues, profits and profitability” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Changes to the CDPAP model in New York could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Ensuring Access to Medicaid Services Final Rule (CMS 2442-F),17.4.1,,"On April 22, 2024, CMS announced a final rule intended to improve access to services and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries across fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems. The final rule includes several measures intended to promote transparency and enhance quality and access to services, including a variety of reporting requirements for states. The final rule also includes significant provisions related to HCBS, including the “80/20” or “payment adequacy” requirement, which will require states to ensure that at least 80% of all Medicaid payments a provider receives for homemaker, home health aide and personal care services, less certain excluded costs, under certain programs are spent on total ----- compensation (including benefits) for direct care workers and clinical/care supervisory workers furnishing these services, rather than administrative overhead or profit, subject to limited exceptions. States are required to ensure compliance with the 80/20 requirement by mid-2030. In comparison to the proposed rule, the final rule made a number of technical changes to the definitions used in calculating compliance that clarified or narrowed the revenue covered by the calculation and clarified or expanded the payments to workers that are counted in satisfying the requirement, which combined to make compliance less onerous to providers. We believe there is the potential for further changes to the final rule given the long implementation period, the potential for future litigation, administration changes, further sub-regulatory rulemaking and state changes in response to the final rule. Although we currently believe the final rule would not have a material impact on our business, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the final rule in future periods. Any changes to our strategy as a result could significantly impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement—Changes to existing government healthcare programs and healthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to profitably offer our services and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

We believe total hours data provide useful supplemental information to investors in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in this segment because the Home Care segment is primarily focused on delivering ongoing care on a long-term basis and net service revenues in this segment are primarily derived from the number of hours we serve our clients. We also believe total hours provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our net service revenues.

We define material acquisitions as any acquisition contributing more than $10 million in revenues for the twelve-month period preceding the completion of the transaction. We believe this metric is useful in evaluating trends in our business as it allows us to measure revenue growth in a consistent manner across periods. The nature, size and number of acquisitions and divestitures can vary significantly from period to period and adjusting for the impact of such transactions facilitates comparability of results. This metric excludes any acquisitions we have completed since June 30, 2024. See “Summary—Recent Developments.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.7,Key Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Financial Measures,17.7.5,Adjusted EBITDA,"We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our performance which is derived from our consolidated financial information but which is not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this offering memorandum because it is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to analyzing operating expenses, evaluating performance and performing strategic planning and annual budgeting. We define EBITDA as income (loss) from continuing operations adjusted for (i) depreciation and amortization expense, (ii) tax expense, net and (iii) interest expense, net. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for (i) equity compensation expense, (ii) results of operations of exited geographies following the decision to exit, (iii) net loss from the Care Coordination Group start-up, (iv) severance costs, (v) costs incurred related to transformational activities, including acquisition and disposition-related expenses, gains and losses, capital markets and strategic transaction expenses and non ----- capitalizable costs associated with technology and process transformation, and (vi) other non-recurring costs or costs that we believe are not indicative of our core operations. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period. Moreover, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. In calculating this financial measure, we make certain adjustments that are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to have been inaccurate. In addition, in evaluating this financial measure, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to those eliminated or adjusted for in this offering memorandum. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There are limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA presented in this offering memorandum. For example, Adjusted EBITDA as used herein may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of such measure for comparative purposes. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using this non-GAAP measure only supplementally. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to exclude the impact of certain items that could reasonably occur in future periods. However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the core operations of our business and may complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results to other companies over time. Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered as an indicator of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for income (loss) from continuing operations prepared in accordance with GAAP. As such, Adjusted EBITDA should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to (loss) income from continuing operations, its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, is presented below. We encourage you to review the reconciliation in conjunction with the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented. In future fiscal periods, we may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. The table below provides reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to (loss) income from continuing operations on a consolidated basis for HAH Holdings LLC:",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

(collectively, the “New York Acquisition”). The acquisition earn-out was recorded as an operating expense due to the continued employment of a previous owner during fiscal year 2022. In June 2023, an agreement was reached whereby (i) we paid $108.3 million in cash to the New York Acquisition seller and (ii) the New York Acquisition seller surrendered certain rollover equity valued at $14.7 million. Accordingly, we recorded a $26.4 million benefit during the six months ended June 30, 2023 and year ended December 31, 2023. (b) In November 2022 we completed the sale of certain non-core operations historically reported within the Home Care segment for $0.3 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.2 million. This disposal did not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. (c) For the year ended December 31, 2022, impairment charges of $53.6 million included (i) $10.2 million related to the Hospice Disposition and the final loss on sale measured at closing and classified as impairment; and (ii) $43.4 million to fully impair the goodwill of the former Skilled Care reporting unit during the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment due to the surrender of certain Skilled Care operating licenses and the Hospice Disposition. During the year ended December 31, 2021, (i) a $0.2 million impairment charge was recorded as a result of declines in business performance in connection with the Community Living Disposition and (ii) a $3.6 million impairment charge was recorded as a result of the identification of certain impairment triggers related to our amortizable intangible assets, including trade name and market access assets, in connection with the Community Living Disposition. (d) We reached a strategic decision to exit the Alabama market effective October 1, 2023 and to exit certain of our Florida operations effective January 1, 2024. As operations in these states were wound down and these operations are not viewed as part of our ongoing operations, we excluded any financial net expense or benefit from the respective date of the decision to exit. (e) We launched the Care Coordination business in 2021 and began limited revenue generating operations in 2022. For financial reporting purposes, HAH Holdings LLC defines Home Care and Care Coordination, which includes the Care Coordination Group, as separate operating segments. The Care Coordination segment has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues as of the date of this offering memorandum, and the Care Coordination Group will not guarantee or provide collateral support for the notes. In light of the foregoing, we do not view the current financial performance of the Care Coordination segment as indicative of future revenue or costs and view activity of the segment in 2022 through 2024 as start-up costs that have been excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. For additional information, see “Presentation of Information.” (f) We do not currently have a recurring equity grant plan; however, equity compensation is awarded for specific events and circumstances. There is no cash settlement currently required for equity awards. Refer to Note 14 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information. (g) Cost of service revenues include certain duplicative costs related to systems migrations and insurance policies after certain acquisitions that do not represent ongoing costs of the business post-acquisition and are eliminated at the conclusion of the relevant overlap period. (h) Severance actions have been taken in each of the periods presented for reasons including, but not limited to: (i) changes in key corporate and operational personnel to align with corporate strategy and operational effectiveness; (ii) changes in personnel to align costs and operating structure with a redefined operating model; and (iii) changes in market strategy. (i) Since 2021, we have made significant investment in our revenue cycle management program, including: (i) creation of a centralized data warehouse allowing for approximately real-time visibility and management of payor level data; (ii) centralization of the authorization management process; (iii) centralization of the billing and collection process and team; and (iv) addition of key personnel to manage and monitor this function. Management identified instances in 2023, 2022 and 2021 where an elevated amount of receivables was identified as uncollectible due to past practices. Where the elevated losses were ascribed to specific facts and circumstances and specific geographies and a remediation plan has been put into place, the financial statement impact of the incremental loss is reflected in this adjustment. (j) We have incurred operating expenses related to strategic transactions, strategic initiatives, process optimization and legal and other matters. Costs related to strategic transactions include due diligence and integration costs as well as costs incurred and expensed to finance these transactions. Costs related to strategic initiatives include costs related to deployment of recruiting tools, caregiver mobile application and interface, implementation of our operating model and other similar projects. Process optimization costs consist primarily of temporary labor, advisory and recruiting fees incurred as we transformed our internal processes and personnel. This also includes costs incurred related to improvements to cybersecurity and IT infrastructure. Legal costs consist primarily of third-party fees incurred related primarily to strategic transactions, capital structure, government relations matters and certain corporate or litigation matters. Legal costs also include settlements of $1.5 million in 2023 and $0.8 million in 2022 that we do not expect to recur.

Generally, these contracts are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor and establish the terms of a payor relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed at a stated rate. We are paid through these contracts as we serve our clients; in order to be paid, this time must be authorized by the payor and the services delivered by our caregivers and other members of our care team. We do not recognize net service revenues at the time we enter into the contract with the payor, but instead recognize net service revenues as we satisfy our performance obligations over time. We determine the transaction price based on gross charges for services provided, adjusted by variable consideration (such as implicit price concessions). Amounts collected from all sources may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions. Net service revenues are recorded net of implicit price concessions estimated based on historical collection experience to reduce revenue to the estimated amount we expect to collect. The initial estimate of net service revenues is determined by reducing the standard charge by any implicit price concessions.

Within Illinois, a significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from one payor. The Illinois Department on Aging, the largest payor program for our Illinois operations, accounted for 14% and 16% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15%, 18% and 23% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also derive a significant amount of our net service revenues in Pennsylvania, which represented 22% of our net service revenues for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, 23% and 23% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 22%, 24% and 28% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Within Pennsylvania, a significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from Keystone, the state’s largest MCO. Keystone accounted for less than 10% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Keystone accounted for 4%, 9% and 10% of our net service revenues for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The overall increase in net service revenues derived from MCOs was driven by (i) the New York Acquisition and Recco Acquisition in New York, which is primarily an MCO payor state; (ii) the Open Systems Acquisition in Pennsylvania, which is primarily an MCO payor state; and (iii) organic growth in New York and Pennsylvania.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in hours associated both with organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization included in the calculation of gross profit increased $4.0 million due to amortization of additional intangible assets associated with acquisitions. _General and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization_ General and administrative expenses increased by $25.1 million, or 15.8%, to $183.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $158.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses include corporate operating expenses of $86.4 million and $64.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, general and administrative expenses included (i) $1.5 million and $1.4 million of equity compensation costs, (ii) $1.0 million and $0.7 million of severance costs and (iii) $38.6 million and $19.4 million of costs related to acquisitions and dispositions, costs related to strategic and transformation projects including non-capitalizable expenses associated with technology transformation and other non-recurring costs. Excluding these costs, general and administrative expenses increased $5.4 million, or 4.0%, to $142.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $137.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing 12.8% and 14.1%, respectively, of net service revenues for the corresponding periods. The decrease in these costs as a percentage of net service revenues is due to operating efficiencies from scaling our business. ----- Depreciation and amortization increased $1.0 million, or 41.0%, based on an increase in fixed assets as a result of acquisitions as well as increases in capitalized software. _Acquisition earn-out (benefit) expense_ The six months ended June 30, 2023 include the impact of the earn-out settlement relating to the New York Acquisition whereby (i) we paid $108.3 million in cash to the seller and (ii) the seller surrendered 7.6 million Class A units, valued at $1.94 per unit, or $14.7 million total, which were included as rollover equity in the New York Acquisition. Accordingly, we recorded a $26.4 million benefit during the six months ended June 30, 2023 equal to the difference between net consideration paid and the prior estimated fair value recorded for this settlement. _Interest expense, net_ Interest expense, net increased by $13.9 million to $71.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $57.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was due primarily to higher average debt, which increased from $961.1 million as of December 31, 2022 to $1,026.2 million as of June 30, 2023 and from $1,120.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to $1,173.3 million as of June 30, 2024. The increase in outstanding borrowings over this time period was primarily due to funding the cash component of the New York Acquisition and related earn-out as well as the Open Systems Acquisition, the Recco Acquisition and the Affordable Acquisition. In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2023, we recognized a $1.4 million gain on interest rate cap agreements compared to none during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Our interest rate cap agreements terminated in February 2024. _Tax expense_ Tax expense was less than $0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to tax expense of $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

The “Open Systems Acquisition” is defined as the acquisition by Excel Companion Care, LLC and Help at Home Delaware, LLC, (both wholly owned subsidiaries of HAH Group Holding Company LLC) of 100% of the membership interests of OSHI Holdings, LLC (“Open Systems PA”) and assets related to and used in connection with the operations of OSHI Delaware (“Open Systems DE” and, together with Open Systems PA, “Open Systems”) on September 7, 2022 and December 12, 2022, respectively, for a total purchase price of $63.8 million in cash. The “Alliance Acquisition” is defined as the acquisition by Help at Home of Michigan, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of HAH Holdings LLC) of 100% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Universal Medical Staffing, Inc. (“Alliance”) for a purchase price of $6.3 million in June 2022. _Cost of service revenues and depreciation and amortization_ Cost of service revenues increased by $329.6 million, or 27.4%, to $1,533.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $1,203.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in hours associated with organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Cost of service revenues grew by more than net service revenues due to market-based wage rate increases primarily in Pennsylvania during a period in which there were no increases in reimbursement rates. Depreciation and amortization included in the calculation of gross profit increased $1.4 million, or 4.9%, due to amortization of additional intangible assets associated with the above referenced acquisitions. _General and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization_ General and administrative expenses increased by $52.4 million, or 18.6%, to $333.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. General and administrative expenses include corporate operating expenses of $147.1 million and $118.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses other than corporate operating expenses is primarily due to a full year of ownership of the New York Acquisition in 2023 compared to nine months in the prior year and costs associated with the Open Systems Acquisition and the Recco Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, general and administrative expenses included (i) $3.9 million and $2.8 million of equity compensation costs, (ii) $1.9 million and $2.1 million of severance costs and (iii) $53.4 million and $35.0 million of costs related to acquisitions and dispositions, costs related to strategic and transformation projects including non-capitalizable expenses associated with technology transformation and other non-recurring costs. Excluding these costs, general and administrative expenses increased $33.1 million, or 13.7%, to $274.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $241.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, representing 13.6% and 14.9%, respectively, of net service revenues for such periods. Depreciation and amortization increased $1.9 million, or 53.3%, year-over-year based on an increase in fixed assets as a result of the New York Acquisition as well as increases in capitalized software. ----- _Acquisition earn-out (benefit) expense_ Acquisition earn-out includes a $120.0 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the estimated fair value of the earn-out relating to the New York Acquisition. The acquisition earn-out was recorded as an operating expense due to the continued employment of a previous owner during 2022. Subsequently, in June 2023, an agreement was reached whereby (i) we paid $108.3 million in cash to the seller and (ii) the seller surrendered 7.6 million Class A units, valued at $1.94 per unit, or $14.7 million total, which were included as rollover equity in the New York Acquisition. Accordingly, we recorded a $26.4 million benefit during the year ended December 31, 2023. _Loss on sale of a business_ In November 2022, we completed the sale of certain legal entities historically reported within the Home Care operating segment for $0.3 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.2 million. This disposal did not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. _Impairment charges_ For the year ended December 31, 2022, Impairment charges of $53.6 million included (i) $10.2 million related to the Hospice Disposition and the final loss on sale measured at closing and classified as impairment and (ii) $43.4 million to fully impair the goodwill of the former Skilled Care reporting unit during the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment due to the surrender of certain Skilled Care operating licenses and the Hospice Disposition. _Interest expense, net_ Interest expense, net increased by $60.6 million to $125.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings, which increased from $731.0 million as of December 31, 2021 to $961.1 million as of December 31, 2022 and to $1,120.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in outstanding borrowings over this period was primarily due to funding the New York Acquisition, including the initial purchase price in April 2022 and the related earn-out in July 2023 as well as the Open Systems and Recco Acquisitions. In addition, in 2022 we recognized a $14.4 million gain on interest rate cap agreements compared to a $1.4 million gain in 2023. _Tax benefit (expense)_ Tax benefit was $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to tax expense of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

The increase in general and administrative expenses other than corporate operating expenses is primarily due to the ongoing costs associated with the New York Acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, General and administrative expenses included (i) $2.8 million and $2.5 million of equity compensation costs, (ii) $2.1 million and $5.0 million of severance costs and (iii) $35.0 million and $34.6 million of costs related to acquisitions and dispositions, costs related to strategic and transformation projects including non-capitalizable expenses associated with technology transformation and other non-recurring costs. Excluding these costs, general and administrative expenses increased $60.2 million, or 33.2%, to $241.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $181.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. These costs are 14.9% and 17.8% of net service revenues, respectively, with a decrease based on operating efficiencies in the scalability of the business and reductions in operating expenses in Indiana following the surrender ----- of certain licenses. The overall increase in general and administrative expense is attributed primarily to the acquisitions completed in new geographies. Depreciation and amortization increased $2.3 million year-over-year based on an increase in fixed assets as a result of the New York Acquisition as well as increases in capitalized software. _Acquisition earn-out expense_ Acquisition earn-out includes a $120.0 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 based on the estimated fair value of the New York Acquisition earn-out agreement. The acquisition earn-out was recorded as an operating expense due to the continued employment of a previous owner during 2022. _Loss on sale of a business_ In November 2022, we completed the sale of certain legal entities historically reported within the Home Care operating segment for $0.3 million and recorded a loss on the sale of $0.2 million. This disposal did not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations. _Impairment charges_ For the year ended December 31, 2022, Impairment charges of $53.6 million included (i) $10.2 million related to the Hospice Disposition and the final loss on sale measured at closing and classified as impairment and (ii) $43.4 million to fully impair the goodwill of the former Skilled Care reporting unit during the annual evaluation of goodwill impairment due to the surrender of certain Skilled Care operating licenses and the Hospice Disposition. During the year ended December 31, 2021, (i) a $0.2 million impairment charge was recorded as a result of declines in business performance in connection with the Community Living Disposition and (ii) a $3.6 million impairment charge was recorded as a result of the identification of certain impairment triggers related to amortizable intangible assets, including trade name and market access assets, in connection with the sale of the Community Living Disposition. _Interest expense, net_ Interest expense, net increased by $9.6 million to $64.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $55.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings, which increased from $731.0 million as of December 31, 2021 to $961.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The increase in outstanding borrowings over this time period was primarily due to funding the New York Acquisition as well as the Open Systems Acquisition. In addition, in 2022 we recognized a $14.4 million gain on interest rate cap agreements compared to a $1.5 million gain in 2021. _Tax expense (benefit)_ Tax expense was $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to tax benefit of $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Tax benefit or expense results from certain entities in our organizational structure that are taxed as C corporations. _Total income from discontinued operations_ The Community Living Disposition was completed in October 2021 and the business met the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. Accordingly, the net results of the business prior to completion of the sale are excluded from individual financial statement line items and are presented as the $0.3 million loss from discontinued operations. In addition, in connection with the completion of the sale and receipt of $16.7 million in cash, a gain on sale of $6.3 million was recognized and included within the total income from discontinued operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Skilled Care, which was previously defined as an operating segment, was consolidated into the Home Care operating segment. Our sole reportable segment is Home Care. Care Coordination, which does not meet the threshold for presentation as a reportable segment, is presented as “Other” in the notes to the financial statements of Parent and contains the financial results of the Care Coordination Group. The financial results of the Issuer are represented in their entirety by the financial results of the Home Care operating segment and the unallocated corporate costs. The Care Coordination segment has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues as of the date of this offering memorandum, and the Care Coordination Group will not guarantee or provide collateral support for the notes offered hereby. See “Presentation of Information.” From time to time there are intercompany receivables or payables between the Home Care and Care Coordination segments that are eliminated in consolidation. Corporate operating expenses are presented as unallocated. Interest expense and tax expense are also not allocated to the operating segments. All prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to our current reporting structure. Our CODM evaluates the financial performance of our operating segments primarily based upon their revenues, gross profit and operating expenses. See Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for additional information. There are no revenue transactions between our reportable segments. Our CODM does not separately evaluate assets by segment, and therefore assets by segment are not presented.

This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in hours associated both with organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Depreciation and amortization included in the calculation of gross profit increased $4.0 million due to amortization of additional intangible assets associated with the above referenced acquisitions. Payor relationship assets associated with the Recco Acquisition and the Affordable Acquisition are recorded and amortized over periods of six months or less while clients and caregivers are migrated to our contracts and platforms. _Gross margin and gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization_ Gross margin declined from 22.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to 21.6% for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Excluding depreciation and amortization, gross margin declined from 23.6% to 23.4% over the same periods. The larger decline in total gross margin is attributed to the aforementioned acceleration in amortization of certain intangible assets. The decline in margin excluding depreciation and amortization is attributed to (i) margin expansion in Indiana and Mississippi based on rate increases effective July 1, 2023; (ii) margin expansion in Ohio and Delaware based on rate increases effective in 2024; (iii) margin compression in Pennsylvania on market-based wage increases in a period with no effective rate increases; and (iv) declines of certain high-margin service offerings associated with exited contracts in New York. _General and administrative expenses_ General and administrative expenses increased by $3.7 million, or 4.1%, to $95.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 compared to $91.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023.

This increase was primarily attributable to the increase in hours associated with organic growth as well as the impact of acquisitions. Cost of service revenues grew by more than net service revenues due to market-based wage rate increases primarily in Pennsylvania during a period in which there were no increases in reimbursement rates. Depreciation and amortization included in the calculation of gross profit increased $1.4 million, or 4.9%, due to amortization of additional intangible assets associated with the above referenced acquisitions. _Gross margin and gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization_ Gross margin declined from 23.7% for the year ended December 31, 2022 to 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding depreciation and amortization, gross margin declined from 25.5% to 23.9% over the same periods. The decline in margin both including and excluding depreciation and amortization is attributed to (i) margin compression in Pennsylvania on market-based wage increases in a period with no effective rate increases; (ii) margin compression in Indiana and Ohio due to reductions in the legacy Skilled Care operations; and (iii) mix shift to lower margin states including New York. _General and administrative expenses_ General and administrative expenses increased by $20.3 million, or 12.5%, to $182.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $162.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These costs are 9.1% and 10.1% of net service revenues with a decline based on operating efficiencies in scalability of the business.

As of June 30, 2024, we had liquidity of approximately $199.2 million, which consisted of $32.2 million of cash and $167.0 million of borrowing availability under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2024, the maximum borrowing capacity under the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility was $167.0 million, and no amounts were drawn. The Existing Credit Facilities contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations to liens, indebtedness, guarantees, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions and dispositions of assets. Our primary liquidity and capital resource needs are to finance our operating expenses, acquisitions, working capital, other liabilities, for general corporate purposes and to service our debt. Prior to giving effect to the Transactions, most of our debt obligations mature in 2027 or beyond with only the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility containing an earlier maturity date in 2025. Total debt as of June 30, 2024 was $1,175.1 million, consisting of borrowings under the Existing Credit Facilities and finance lease obligations. Our access to the debt markets has historically provided us with sources of liquidity. We do not anticipate having difficulty in obtaining financing in the future given relationships with financial institutions; however unexpected disruptions to the macroeconomic and regulatory environment and could make financing more difficult to obtain in the short term on favorable terms. We may, from time to time, take steps to reduce our debt or interest costs. The amount of debt that may be repaid or refinanced will depend on market conditions, trading levels of the debt, cash positions and compliance with debt covenants. We believe funds provided by our primary sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our liquidity, debt repayment obligations and capital resource needs for at least the next 12 months under current operating conditions. As of June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded legal settlement liabilities of $20.0 million, $22.9 million and $25.6 million, respectively. The liabilities as of both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included $17.3 million from an expected legal settlement from the New York Acquisition that was indemnifiable under the purchase agreement related to the acquisition and relates to conduct by the former owners that preceded the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the settlement balance was released from escrow to us. We are in the process of negotiating settlement agreements on this matter with, among other parties, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, the ----- Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice on the behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. To the extent final settlement amounts differ from the amount released from escrow, we expect any additional amounts, if any, to be indemnifiable under the purchase agreement related to the acquisition. If and when such settlement is finalized, the settlement balance will be paid in cash, decreasing the cash on our balance sheet. See Note 13 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and Note 17 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum, “Risk Factors—Our operations subject us to risk of litigation” and “Risk Factors—Previously completed or future acquisitions and new office openings may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Acquisitions are accounted for as purchases and are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective acquisition dates. We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of the acquired businesses to the tangible assets, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on the estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The determination of fair value involves estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available. We utilize various techniques to determine fair value in accordance with accepted valuation models, although primarily the income approach. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred. Asset acquisitions are accounted for using a cost accumulation model, with the cost of the acquisition allocated to the acquired assets based on their relative fair values. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. See Note 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum for further detail on the acquisitions and related accounting.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur. Such events may include a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. We first perform a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and if a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. This includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, fair value history and other company specific events. If this qualitative analysis, or significant adverse changes in future financial performance, indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, we would then need to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. Reporting units are also tested for impairment prior to any change in reporting units in order to reallocate goodwill, if necessary, between the reporting unit components. Such reallocation is recognized as of the date of reassessment and periods prior to the reassessment are not adjusted. Acquired intangible assets subject to amortization, which include trade names, market access assets and noncompete agreements, are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If a triggering event occurs, we determine whether the definite-lived intangible assets are recoverable, determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows generated from the use of the asset group. Intangible assets are tested for impairment under their respective accounting standards and as appropriate, the assets’ or asset groups’ carrying amounts are adjusted for impairment before testing goodwill for impairment.

Additional revenue is generated from contracts with commercial insurers and private consumers. Generally, these contracts, which are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor, establish the terms of a payor relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed at a stated rate. However, the contracts do not give rise to rights and obligations until an order is placed with us. When an order is placed, it typically creates the performance obligation to provide a defined quantity of service hours, authorized hours or days, per client. We satisfy our performance obligations over time, given that consumers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by us as the services are performed. Customer contracts generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated with advance notice. As we have the right to consideration from customers commensurate with the value provided to clients from the performance completed over a given invoice period, we use the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations and recognize client service revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice. We determine the transaction price within our customers contracts based on gross charges for services provided, adjusted by variable consideration (such as implicit price concessions). Net service revenues are recorded net of explicit contractual revenue adjustments and implicit price concessions estimated based on historical collection experience to reduce revenue to the estimated amount we expect to collect. Amounts collected from all sources may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions. Management monitors net service revenues and collections from these sources and records any necessary adjustment to net service revenues based upon its assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer healthcare coverage and other collection indicators. The initial estimate of net service revenues is determined by reducing the standard charge by any contractual adjustments, discounts and implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of net service revenues are generally recorded in the period of the change. Changes in estimates of implicit price concessions, discounts and contractual adjustments for performance obligations satisfied in prior years resulted in both increases and decreases to net service revenue. Our payment terms are less than one year. As such, none of our contracts has a significant financing component.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

We believe the credit risk associated with our Medicaid accounts, our primary payors is limited due to (i) the historical collection rates and (ii) the fact that these entities are government funded, primarily with Medicaid funding. Our largest single payor is the Illinois Department on Aging which is an Illinois state Medicaid entity. We do not believe that there are any other significant concentrations from any payor that would subject us to significant credit risk in the collection of client accounts receivable. At each reporting date, we assess our future estimated price concessions on unpaid accounts receivable.

For HAH Holdings LLC and its subsidiaries other than HAH of Ohio LLC and its subsidiaries, income taxes are not payable or provided for by the Company with the exception of the New York City Unincorporated Business Tax (“UBT”). UBT is a tax on partnerships, which is considered an income tax for accounting purposes. Members are taxed individually on their pro rata ownership share of our earnings. Net income or loss is allocated among the members in accordance with the operating agreement. For HAH of Ohio LLC and its subsidiaries, income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would not be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Uncertain tax positions are accounted for on the basis of a two-step process in which (i) it is determined whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (ii) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, with related finance lease liabilities included in accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.

We use our incremental borrowing rate, if our leases do not provide an implicit rate, based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on our estimated credit rating, the term of the lease, economic environment where the asset resides and full collateralization.

We seek to maintain an appropriate amount of fixed rate debt obligations, either directly or through interest rate derivative contracts that limit the maximum interest rate on a portion of our floating rate debt obligations. We assess the anticipated mix of the fixed versus floating amount of debt, periodically with the purpose of hedging the variability of interest expense on our floating rate debt. As of June 30, 2024, we had approximately $1,204.6 million of variable rate debt under the Existing Credit Facilities, none of which was subject to an interest rate hedge. The interest on the Existing First Lien Term Loan Facility and Existing Second Lien Term Loan Facility is subject to a 1.00% SOFR floor. The Existing Credit Facilities will be repaid in connection with the Transactions and we will enter into the new Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which will consist of a $900.0 million Term Loan Facility and a $250.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Certain Other Indebtedness.” In the future, the interest rate may increase, and we may be subject to increased interest expense. Assuming the Existing First Lien Revolving Credit Facility was fully drawn, an increase of 100 basis points in the applicable interest rate would increase our annual interest expense on our floating rate debt by approximately $11.5 million and a decrease of 100 basis points in the applicable interest rate would reduce our annual interest expense bon our floating rate debt by approximately $11.5 million.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Because of its inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. In connection with the audit for the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified certain material weaknesses in our internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in ICFR such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Each of these material weaknesses was initially identified in connection with the audit for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management subsequently remediated certain material weaknesses in our internal controls, and the following material weaknesses that were identified remain outstanding. We did not design or maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our applicable financial reporting requirements. We lacked a sufficient number of professionals with (i) an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately, and (ii) an appropriate level of knowledge and experience to establish effective processes and controls. Additionally, the limited personnel resulted in our inability to consistently establish appropriate authorities and responsibilities in pursuit of our financial reporting objectives, as demonstrated by, amongst other things, insufficient SOD in our finance and accounting functions. This material weakness contributed to the below material weaknesses. ----- We did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures. Specifically, we did not design and maintain controls to ensure (i) appropriate segregation of duties in the preparation and review of account reconciliations and journal entries, and (ii) account reconciliations and journal entries were reviewed at the appropriate level of precision. These material weaknesses contributed to several accounting adjustments being made to our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 related to our accounting for discontinued operations, goodwill and intangible assets, general and administrative expenses and distributions to unit holders as well as certain disclosures related to fixed assets, and share-based compensation. We did not design and maintain effective IT general controls for information systems that are relevant to the preparation of our financial statements. This material weakness contributed to the above material weaknesses. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: (i) program change management controls to ensure that information technology program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; (ii) user access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs, and data to appropriate personnel; (iii) computer operations controls to ensure that processing and transfer of data, and data backups and recovery are monitored; and (iv) program development controls to ensure that new software development is tested, authorized and implemented appropriately. These IT deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatement to one or more assertions, along with the IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of system-generated data and reports) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting all financial statement accounts and disclosures that would not be prevented or detected. Accordingly, we determined these deficiencies in the aggregate constitute a material weakness. Each of the control deficiencies could result in a future material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. While we have implemented a plan to remediate these material weaknesses, we cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful or, if successful, the timing of achieving our remediation efforts, which could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, and actions we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses in our ICFR or that they will prevent or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing or any future material weaknesses in our ICFR, or identify any additional material weaknesses, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be negatively impacted, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Founded in 1975, we believe we are the largest home care provider in the United States based on revenue derived from personal care services, with net service revenues of $2.15 billion and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA of $269.6 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, respectively. We operate across 11 states serving approximately 67,000 clients and providing approximately 80 million hours of care in the home on an annualized basis as of June 30, 2024. Attractive Geographic Footprint Help at Home’s mission is To Enable Individuals to Have Great Days with Independence and Dignity at Home and we strive to create a workplace that values Service, Accountability, Integrity, Teamwork and Innovation. We deliver essential care to some of the most vulnerable individuals in our society who have few reliable alternatives to remain independent in their homes. We employ a dedicated care workforce, including approximately 58,000 caregivers as of June 30, 2024, that is trained to provide services and supports for ADL, address HRSN and coordinate care and other services for clients in their homes. Our care workforce performs a wide range of services, including assistance with ambulation, bathing and grooming, medication reminders and closing gaps in care. We believe our care model is highly differentiated within the broader healthcare ecosystem due to our ability to engage clients in a trusted relationship that is characterized by both high frequency of visits and long duration of service, giving us unique perspectives into the complex chronic population we serve. Our Home Care operating segment, which accounted for more than 99% of our net service revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, provides non-medical personal care services to support ADL for individuals with complex chronic health care needs, such as assistance with ambulation, bathing and grooming and medication reminders. In addition, our frequent and regular interactions with these individuals over the course of an average of approximately four years can create opportunities to improve care through expanded services in a high engagement “Care Coordination” model. We have developed a Care Coordination operating segment (which has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues) with offerings designed to identify and prevent the exacerbation of chronic conditions, help close gaps in care and connect individuals with primary and specialty care. The programs we have developed for Care Coordination are reinforced by strong client engagement through frequent interactions with our caregivers and digital capture of changes in condition by our care teams and are further supported by nurses, community health workers and social workers in a ----- population-based model. We believe our Care Coordination capabilities enhance our Home Care business through increased client and caregiver retention and improved satisfaction. In comparison to other in-home based care models, such as skilled nursing and other home health care services that are required to be performed by licensed medical professionals, which tend to be episodic in nature, our home care model is designed to engage complex chronic populations on a longitudinal basis, supporting them continuously with ADL. In 2023, our compassionate caregivers spent an average of 22 hours per week in the homes of the individuals we served, and the average tenure of both clients and caregivers was approximately four years, which we believe is driven by strong satisfaction and high engagement. Our differentiated culture of “Caring for the Caregiver,” in which we emphasize the value of our dedicated caregivers and provide exceptional service to these individuals, has contributed to a 12-month caregiver retention of approximately 66% for the year ended December 31, 2022. This compares to an industry-wide median retention rate of approximately 23%, which we believe reflects the broader industry’s use of caregivers on a more episodic basis and diminished emphasis on a long-term trusted partnership between caregivers and clients. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 80% of our clients were dually eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare and, as these complex chronic individuals age, their care needs expand. The services we provide allow these individuals to remain in their homes, helping avoid more costly institutional settings such as skilled nursing facilities, acute care hospitals and other higher-cost institutional sites of care. According to the Genworth Cost of Care Survey in 2023, the average daily cost of nursing home stay is estimated to be between two and three times the daily cost of home care services. Our services are primarily reimbursed on a per hour basis and funded through Medicaid HCBS programs, which are administered by MCOs or state-based agencies. In 2023, 67% of our net service revenues were derived from Medicaid MCOs, 32% were derived from state-based or local agencies that administer Medicaid LTSS programs on behalf of states and the remaining 1% were derived from the VA, private pay and other sources. We had approximately 250 distinct state, local and MCO payor sources as of June 30, 2024 and we believe that the diversity of our payors, as well as widespread governmental and MCO support for the Medicaid HCBS we deliver, provides stability in our business and helps insulate us from significant reductions in the rates we are paid. Rates are primarily based on published Medicaid fee schedules or negotiated directly with third-party payors and in some cases also include additional incentive payments for performance or quality-based metrics, providing us with an opportunity to enhance the economics of our hourly-based reimbursement model. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, approximately 0.5% of our net service revenues were derived from pay-for-performance or quality-based arrangements with payor partners. Between calendar years 2021 and 2023, our average annual reimbursement rate per hour increased by 5% on an organic basis (excluding the impact of dispositions and material acquisitions), demonstrating a supportive rate environment across our state and MCO payors. We have experienced broad rate support by these payors within our geographic footprint; the average annual reimbursement rate per hour increase between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024 included the following: Delaware (3% average increase), Georgia (5% average increase), Illinois (7% average increase), Indiana (11% average increase), Michigan (16% average increase), Missouri (15% average increase), Mississippi (7% average increase), New York (3% average increase), Ohio (13% average increase) and Pennsylvania (3% average increase). ----- Help at Home Payor Mix The market in which we operate is large, highly fragmented and growing rapidly. We have been able to capitalize on market trends by generating strong organic growth and supplementing our efforts with accretive acquisitions. From 2021 to 2023, we generated a net service revenue CAGR of 41% and a Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 44%. Between 2021 and 2023, our average organic net service revenue growth was 10%, we completed 19 acquisitions and we entered four new states.

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.65,Industry Overview,17.65.1,,"The healthcare industry is one of the largest and fastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy. From 2023 to 2032, the CMS estimates that national healthcare expenditures are expected to increase at an annual growth rate of 5.6% from $4.8 trillion to $7.7 trillion. U.S. healthcare expenditures are being driven in part by ongoing growth in the aging population and longer life expectancy. The population of individuals 65 years of age or older is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of 2.7% between 2020 and 2030 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Increasing demand for services and supports in the home is also being driven by the aging population’s health care needs, which are expected to increase over time, and a preference for aging in place. According to surveys by the American Association of Retired Persons, more than 80% of individuals 65 years of age or older prefer to age in place in the home. The dually-eligible enrollees that we primarily serve are a rapidly growing population that has higher medical costs than average Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries overall. Between 2011 and 2021, dual-eligible enrollment and spending increased at a CAGR of 2.5% and 5.3%, respectively, according to CMS. In 2021, dual-eligible enrollees represented 19% of total Medicare beneficiaries but comprised 35% of total Medicare expenditures, and together Medicare and Medicaid dual-eligible expenditures comprised approximately $493.5 billion with spending per beneficiary nearly 2.5 times that of average Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. ----- Within the broader U.S. healthcare system, the home care industry occupies a large, highly fragmented and rapidly growing market. Total industry expenditures are expected to increase from $90.0 billion in 2020 to $205.0 billion in 2028, representing a CAGR of 11%. Of the approximately 28,000 personal care providers estimated to be operating across the United States, the top 10 largest providers, including us, comprise approximately 6% of the industry’s total expenditures. We believe this large, fragmented market is highly attractive because it offers both compelling organic and inorganic growth opportunities, especially to scaled, national providers like us that can leverage technology, operational capabilities, relationships with payors and a disciplined acquisition strategy to drive growth. Home Care Industry Fragmentation ----- Medicaid HCBS programs are administered by traditional state and local authorities or Medicaid MLTSS programs through which MCOs administer services on behalf of the state. The number of U.S. states utilizing an MLTSS model has grown meaningfully from eight states in 2004 to 24 states in 2024 according to Advancing States. As of the date of this offering memorandum, six of the 11 states in which we operate have adopted MLTSS models and three more (Georgia, Michigan and Ohio) are actively developing MLTSS programs or new managed care programs for dually-eligible LTSS beneficiaries for the future. We believe the transition to MLTSS has created structural tailwinds as payors seek to reduce their reliance on managing elderly populations within institutional settings, thereby expanding the population we can service in the home. MLTSS payors are typically paid by states on a PMPM basis for the LTSS members they enroll, thereby creating incentives to manage these members’ care in the most appropriate, highest quality and lowest cost setting. As states transition from traditional Medicaid to MLTSS, LTSS spending typically rebalances – over time – from institutional care to HCBS as more LTSS members receive services in these lower cost settings. We believe this MLTSS transition can also result in an increase in the average authorized care plans of clients as payors seek to support LTSS members in their homes longer as they age and their needs increase over time. In addition, as MLTSS markets mature over time, payors frequently introduce performancebased or quality-based incentive reimbursement programs and seek scaled provider partners with which to innovate on these types of value-based arrangements. As depicted in the chart below, the share of Medicaid LTSS spending has shifted significantly from institutional care settings to HCBS settings, with HCBS comprising 62% of LTSS spending in 2020 as compared to 37% in 2005 and institutional comprising 38% of LTSS spending in 2020 as compared to 63% in 2005, based on CMS data. Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020. We believe federal and state policy makers and third-party payors recognize the cost savings of home care compared to institutional settings such as long-term care facilities, the societal benefits associated with aging in place in the ----- community and the need to support a care workforce that has experienced shortages over time. We also believe these structural factors help support the long-term viability and potential growth of our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

We believe our culture of “Caring for the Caregiver” is core to our success and differentiated in our industry, contributing to what we believe are industry-leading caregiver retention rates and strong satisfaction rates. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we had a 12-month caregiver retention rate of approximately 66%, relative to the industry-wide median retention rate for 2022 of approximately 23%. For the year ended December 31, 2023, our 12-month caregiver retention rate increased to approximately 68% and we had client and caregiver NPS of 58 and 41, respectively. We believe our “Caring for the Caregiver” culture and extensive initiatives to improve caregiver retention generate a positive flywheel effect that improves client-caregiver matching and contributes to higher caregiver and client satisfaction, thereby driving the success of our business. Our clients are referred to us primarily by managed care payors and state-based agencies that support LTSS-eligible Medicaid beneficiaries in securing services with a high-quality home care provider that can meet their needs. According to Kaiser Family Foundation research, approximately six million individuals were served by Medicaid LTSS programs as of 2020. Care plans for our clients are developed and authorized by these payors and are typically designed to support ADLs to avoid progression to a more costly setting such as a long-term care facility. ----- Our clients are typically highly vulnerable individuals (most of them are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid) who rely on our continued interaction and support to remain healthy and avoid more costly settings of care. The states in which we operate recognize the value of our services, which has led to significant growth in our client census, while also maintaining an average client tenure of approximately four years, differentiating us from the more episodic nature of care delivered by other home health companies. Help at Home Average Client Census Over Time and Key Client Statistics Note: Metrics as of June 30, 2024. Note: Figures as of end of period. - **_Our business model is aligned with macro trends in healthcare. Healthcare expenditures in the United States are rising rapidly and the most complex chronic patients are a significant driver of this expenditure growth. Home care is part of the cost solution, particularly following the challenges affecting healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumer preferences to avoid facility-based long term care settings and imperatives by payors to reduce utilization in higher cost institutional settings contribute to the attractiveness of home-based care. We believe that our reach into the homes of many patient populations with the highest ----- medical costs if treated in institutional settings positions us to help deliver a better experience for our clients and their families, facilitate improvements in clinical outcomes and reduce costs in healthcare delivery. - **_Our national scale and local density create competitive advantages. We believe that our focus on local market density combined with national scale, and our proven ability to grow distinguishes us in the home care market. The benefits of scale typically include (a) state-wide coverage, positioning us well to serve a larger portion of the population with stronger brand awareness in our markets and to receive a greater share of referrals, (b) being the provider of choice to innovate with payor partners, (c) being the employer of choice for caregivers, (d) being the acquiror of choice for local and regional sellers, and (e) the ability to leverage our field infrastructure over a larger revenue base to gain operating efficiencies. `o` _Our growth orientation. We have doubled the size of our business since 2021, growing from $1.0 billion of net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 to $2.0 billion of net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023, generating a net service revenue CAGR of 41%, organic net service revenue growth averaging 10% per annum and inorganic growth from acquisitions. `o` _Our market leadership in our geographies. Across the 11 states in which we operate, we have built significant regional market density and believe we hold a leading position in four of these states, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana and Mississippi, and we are among the largest home care operators in the remaining states. We believe our market leadership provides a differentiated opportunity to gain share organically and be opportunistic with acquisitions. `o` _Our sophisticated Centerline Operating Model and purpose-built technology environment. Our business is supported by our scalable operating model which we believe offers advantages by blending central efficiencies with local market presence to drive performance. This operating model, which we refer to as the Centerline Operating Model, is based on the standardization of technology, support and incentive structures for our staff. Our Centerline Operating Model provides for consistency in measuring operating and performance metrics, such as care plan authorizations and utilization rates, hiring and retention metrics, census trends and satisfaction scores, as well as standardization of our regulatory reporting and core business functions across all of our markets. We have developed a purpose-built technology environment to support our Centerline Operating Model, including a data integration layer that allows us to generate real-time business insights and analytics across agency management systems and enterprise-wide systems such as human capital management, payroll and finance. Since implementing our Centerline Operating Model in 2021, we have continued to make refinements to respond to market needs and to serve our key constituencies – our care teams, our clients and our communities – even more effectively. In addition, these investments in technology allow us to enhance our patient care capabilities by helping identify preventative solutions proactively, address gaps in care and minimize the likelihood of costly and adverse events such as admissions to institutional settings of care. `o` _Our differentiated recruiting and retention engine. We believe the demand for home care services has outpaced the supply of caregivers and other care workers in certain markets, and we see an opportunity as an industry leader to leverage our recruiting and retention capabilities to increase the supply of labor. We believe our strong reputation of caring for caregivers, clients and our communities at the national and local level, coupled with investments we have made in technology, processes, training and onboarding, provide advantages in recruiting and retaining caregivers. We believe that we attract more caregivers due to our higher number of available client care plans near our caregivers’ homes, local brand awareness and our commitment to a culture of “Caring for the Caregiver.” From 2021 to 2023, we have grown the number of employed caregivers at a CAGR of 28%. We continue to focus on improving our recruiting capabilities to support and increase the quality of our care workforce to create additional capacity to meet the rising demand for home care services in our markets. We have invested in management talent and technology to streamline and digitize our recruiting processes which has improved our recruiting yield, lowered recruiting costs per candidate and reduced administrative burden. Our differentiated recruiting engine allows us to engage with candidates on a 24x7 basis and convert qualified applicants into new hires more rapidly, while straight-through-processing allows us to digitally populate candidate data into our human capital management and payroll system to improve ----- data accuracy. From the first quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2024, we improved the number of caregivers hired per business day from approximately 65 to approximately 150, and during the same period we improved our 12-month caregiver retention rate by almost two percentage points to 67%. We have initiatives in place that are designed to improve caregiver retention further with a particular focus on 30-day and 90-day retention metrics, which were 94% and 87% as of June 30, 2024, respectively. We believe these metrics are important determinants for retention, which generates a positive flywheel effect resulting in a more successful client-caregiver matching processes and higher caregiver and client satisfaction. Our scale has allowed us to invest into resources and strategies including advanced analytics to improve matching based on client-caregiver personal preferences, targeted training and on-boarding enhancements, increased specialization of certain central support functions and mobile-based digital tools to support more efficient workflows. We have numerous initiatives in place to improve our recruiting and retention metrics as we continue to refine our processes to grow our care workforce.

Note: Figures as of end of period. ----- - **_Our strong history of successfully sourcing, executing and integrating acquisitions into Help at Home. Our highly experienced corporate development team consists of professionals with extensive experience and strong reputations that allow us to identify potential acquisition targets efficiently and effectively. Our acquisition strategy is centered on identifying targets that: `o` have strong reputations for delivering high quality home care; `o` can increase our presence in existing geographies; `o` can enhance our partnership opportunities with MCOs in states that have transitioned or plan to transition their Medicaid programs to MLTSS programs; `o` can grow the population of complex chronic dual-eligible beneficiaries we can serve; `o` are situated in states that have a history of supportive reimbursement rate environments; and `o` are in markets that are supportive of value-based care offerings in the home. We have a track record of creating value following acquisitions by driving synergies through administrative cost savings, implementing our effective recruiting and retention capabilities, constructively collaborating with payors and optimizing our operations within the context of our payor agreements. Between January 1, 2021 and August 31, 2024, we completed 25 acquisitions. We deployed $703.3 million in aggregate purchase price towards the acquisitions completed during this time period and acquired revenue of $825.3 million based on each acquired company’s revenue in the 12-month period preceding the applicable acquisition. We have also demonstrated the ability to deleverage our balance sheet from consolidated net leverage of 5.9x as of December 31, 2021 to 4.3x as of June 30, 2024 without giving effect to the Transactions. We remain committed to exploring opportunistic acquisition targets as they emerge. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, we completed 10 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of $108.3 million and acquired revenue of $145.8 million based on each acquired company’s revenue in the 12-month period preceding the applicable acquisition.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.” - **_Our exceptional management team has a proven track record. We are led by what we consider is a best-in- class management team with more than 250 years of combined healthcare experience. Our team includes ----- members that have a strong track record of successfully building and scaling multi-billion dollar businesses and executing on operational initiatives and growth strategies in larger public company environments. Our management team has significant managed care experience, which we believe is a competitive advantage as states transition to MLTSS and payor partners seek home care providers that can innovate, deliver high quality care and outperform consistently as industry standards increase. Our executive leadership team is also supported by experienced regional leadership teams, clinical leadership and a field support center with approximately 400 administrative staff. - **_Strong culture of compliance. We believe our focus on compliance provides consistency in our outcomes and produces high quality care. We maintain a company-wide ethics and compliance program designed to ensure that we maintain high standards of ethical conduct in the operation of our business that strive to meet or exceed applicable regulatory guidance and industry standards. We implement, review and refine written policies and procedures for our employees to promote compliance with our policies and applicable laws and regulations and to encourage a “culture of compliance.” We have devised governance structures to oversee our ethics and compliance program and encourage transparency and accountability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.67,Our Growth Strategy,17.67.1,,"The key elements of our growth strategy include: - **_Drive attractive organic growth. Home care is a large and rapidly growing industry, with spending expected to grow at a CAGR of 9% from 2023 through 2028 due to aging demographics, consumer preferences and broad payor support for care in the home over higher-cost institutional care settings. Between 2021 and 2023, our average organic net service revenue growth was approximately 10% driven by approximately 5% volume and approximately 5% reimbursement rate growth. We have historically achieved significant growth through our deliberate selection of states with highly supportive HCBS programs, our local and regional market density, the sophistication of our operations, including our differentiated recruiting and retention capabilities, and our commitment to quality. We believe our market density strategy also allows us to leverage payor partner relationships to increase natural growth across our markets. We have driven organic growth in net service revenues by growing both clients and hours served with our differentiated recruiting and retention engine that has increased our recruitment of dedicated, compassionate caregivers, thereby enabling us to serve more clients and retain existing clients by servicing authorized care plans to optimal levels. We have also driven organic growth by focusing on operational processes that increase client NPS, such as centralized client intake, enhanced analytics for client-caregiver matching, improved communication and advanced digital tools to support our care workforce. Our client NPS was 58 for the year ended December 31, 2023, increasing significantly from 53 for the year ended December 31, 2021 when we first began measuring client NPS. - **_Execute operational initiatives to enhance growth and profitability. We have strategies in place that we believe can create additional growth opportunities and support our margin profile as we leverage our scalable operating model. We expect to increase our reimbursement rates through payor negotiations and the introduction of performance-based incentives and participation in value-based care arrangements, all of which are designed to align with the goals of the value-based care model, which include improved provider economics based on the delivery of higher quality care. Our payor relations team works closely with MCO and state-based partners to identify opportunities for us to be reimbursed differentially when we deliver higher performance and quality care or provide additional services in connection with MCO partners’ value-based care programs. In addition, we have initiatives in place to improve our margin profile by advancing our technology infrastructure with scalable enterprise IT solutions and by scaling our corporate infrastructure over a larger revenue base. During the past two years, we have substantially implemented a new enterprise-wide human capital management and payroll system, a new enterprise-wide financial reporting system and we have also substantially integrated our core operating systems onto a single platform that is optimized into a consistent proprietary data integration layer. We have also built shared service capabilities in key functional areas such as facilities, procurement, payroll and contact center, among others. Our general and administrative expense as a percentage of net service revenues, excluding expenses that are not central to our business or are non-recurring, declined 130 basis points to 12.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. We believe the benefits of these enterprise-wide capability enhancements will increase in the coming years as we leverage the investment and fixed costs of this infrastructure across a larger revenue base. ----- - **_Explore opportunistic acquisitions of compelling targets to accelerate growth. We intend to continue focusing on our strong history of identifying and executing acquisitions within a highly fragmented market landscape. Our acquisition strategy targets transactions that can support the build-out of our market presence in states in which we operate. Subject to any applicable regulatory constraints, on an opportunistic basis, we intend to enter new markets through transactions where we will seek to partner with organizations that have a track record of high-quality care and compliance and operate in markets that meet our strategic criteria. We believe we are viewed as an acquiror of choice in the home care sector given our culture, operational expertise and reputation after nearly 50 years of operations. As a result, the majority of the 25 acquisitions we have completed from 2021 through August 31, 2024 have been self-sourced or exclusive transactions. Since 2021, we have entered four new states (Delaware, Florida, Ohio and New York) and exited three states (Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee) that did not meet our long-term strategy. We are focused on a disciplined approach to capital allocation towards attractively priced transactions that offer potential post-acquisition cost synergies and growth opportunities. - **_Expand offerings to better serve our clients. Constituents across the healthcare system recognize the value of the home care services we deliver, including the MCOs and federal and state governments that stand to benefit from the cost savings we can deliver. We believe the long-term, trusted relationships we have with individuals in their homes are our most important asset, positioning us on the front lines of care with an ability to help improve health outcomes, reduce costs and drive health equity. We are employing these durational relationships to care for the complex chronic individuals we serve and we are investing in capabilities to expand our services to offer higher levels of clinical care coordination, support with health related social needs, medication management and nutrition, among others in our Care Coordination business. Our frequent and regular interactions with these individuals over the course of an average of approximately four years can create opportunities to improve care through expanded services in a high-engagement care model. We have developed offerings designed to identify and prevent the exacerbation of chronic conditions, help close gaps in care and connect individuals with primary and specialty care. The programs we have developed for Care Coordination are reinforced by strong client engagement through frequent interactions with our caregivers and digital capture of changes in condition by our care teams and are further supported by nurses, community health workers and social workers in a population-based model. We believe these Care Coordination capabilities enhance our Home Care business through increased client and caregiver retention and improved satisfaction. We believe that these capabilities have also accelerated our ability to enter into value-based care arrangements with MCOs and riskbased providers. The value-based arrangements for Care Coordination are typically reimbursed on a PMPM basis with shared savings opportunities. Approximately 5,000 of our clients are served in these expanded offerings and we intend to further penetrate our client base with more of these programs and increased opportunities with risk-bearing partners in our markets. Our Care Coordination segment has not yet contributed materially to our net service revenues to date. - **_Evaluate opportunities to strategically expand into adjacent markets with home care services. We believe that we have an opportunity to extend our core Medicaid home care service line of business to capture volume from additional payor sources, such as VA, private pay and Medicare Advantage supplemental home care markets, which represented approximately 1% of total net service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2023. We intend to opportunistically evaluate opportunities across these adjacent markets in existing and new states and diversify our payor and customer base, while still remaining focused as a market leader in the core Medicaid home care offering. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

The home care market has an estimated 28,000 home care providers estimated to be operating across the U.S., and no single competitor has significant market share across all of our markets. There are a handful of scaled providers as well as several smaller companies that provide home care services and that operate in multiple states. We currently compete with personal care service providers, diversified post-acute care providers and private caregivers. Although companies that provide these services are typically small “mom and pop” service providers, including single-site agencies, not-for-profit organizations, community-based organizations and self-directed care programs operating without agency-based providers, some of our competitors are also large publicly held companies and well-financed privately held companies. As a result, some of these providers and competitive care models may have greater financial, technical, political and marketing resources, name recognition or a larger number of clients and payors than we do. In addition, some of our competitors offer more services than we do in the markets in which we operate. We compete based on a number of factors, including our nationwide network, technical expertise, experience, service capability, service quality and price. However, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition from new entrants into our markets, particularly as there are relatively few barriers to entry in some of the markets in which we operate. Increased competition may adversely affect our ability to obtain new client referrals, retain existing clients and grow profitability, and could result in pricing pressures, loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of consumers or payors, any of which could harm our business.

Since a material portion of our revenue and payor arrangements are with stateadministered Medicaid programs, we must comply with extensive participation requirements and frequent governmental audits and inspections. At the state level, we are subject to certain state laws and regulations applicable to home care businesses. Certain counties and cities maintain ordinances applicable to the services our businesses provide. ----- In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes, many of which have been aimed at reducing costs and government spending. The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have considered and passed a large number of laws affecting the healthcare industry, including laws intended to impact access to health insurance. The most prominent of these legislative reform efforts, the ACA, affects how healthcare services are covered, delivered and reimbursed, and expanded health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Additionally, on April 22, 2024, CMS announced a final rule intended to improve access to services and quality of care for Medicaid beneficiaries across fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems. The final rule includes several measures intended to promote transparency and enhance quality and access to services, including a variety of reporting requirements for states. The final rule also includes significant provisions related to HCBS, including the “80/20” or “payment adequacy” requirement, which will require states to ensure that at least 80% of all Medicaid payments a provider receives for homemaker, home health aide, and personal care services, less certain excluded costs, under certain programs are spent on total compensation (including benefits) for direct care workers and clinical/care supervisory workers furnishing these services, rather than administrative overhead or profit, subject to limited exceptions. States are required to ensure compliance with the 80/20 requirement by mid-2030. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Government Regulation and Reimbursement—Changes to existing government healthcare programs and healthcare regulatory reform may affect our ability to profitably offer our services and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition” for a discussion of the risks related to this rule. Additionally, approximately 15 states have enacted state material healthcare transaction notification laws that increase scrutiny on healthcare-related transactions. Some states, like Illinois, only require notification of certain healthcare transactions or affiliations 30 days prior to the closing of such arrangements while other states require covered parties to make a filing 180 days before the closing of certain transactions which may result in state regulators imposing conditions or restrictions on the transaction.

The vendor also advised us that it notified law enforcement of the incident. We also submitted media notices, via press releases, to media outlets in states having 500 or more clients. On August 18, 2024, we delivered a breach notification report to the Office of Civil Rights (“OCR”), as well as to regulatory agencies in nine states in which clients or caregivers reside. On August 22, 2024, OCR delivered notice to us that it is investigating whether we are in compliance with the Federal Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, the Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information and the Breach Notification for Unsecured Protected Health Information Regulations.

On August 29, 2024, a class action lawsuit, Lisa Vaughn _Bernardino v HAH Group Holding Company, LLC d/b/a Help At Home Case No. 1:24-cv-07894, was filed in the United_ States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for additional claims related to this data incident. We intend to defend these lawsuits, we believe we have appropriate insurance coverage and, at this time, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations overall but could impact our financial results in any given fiscal period. As of June 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded legal settlement liabilities of $20.0 million, $22.9 million and $25.6 million, respectively. The liabilities as of both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included $17.3 million from an expected legal settlement from the New York Acquisition that was indemnifiable under the purchase agreement related to the acquisition and relates to conduct by the former owners that preceded the acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the settlement balance was released from escrow to us. We are in the process of negotiating settlement agreements on this matter with, among other parties, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice on the behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. To the extent final settlement amounts differ from the amount released from escrow, we expect any additional amounts, if any, to be indemnifiable under the purchase agreement related to the acquisition. If and when such settlement is finalized, the settlement balance will be paid in cash, decreasing the cash on our balance sheet.

The First Lien Intercreditor Agreement may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time without the consent of the Holders to add other parties holding First Lien Obligations permitted to be incurred under the Indenture and the First Lien Credit Agreement. ----- Under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, as described below and except as expressly set forth therein, the Controlling Collateral Agent has the right to direct foreclosures and take other actions with respect to Shared Collateral, and no Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party shall have any right to take actions with respect to the Shared Collateral. On the Issue Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent, and accordingly, as of the Issue Date and except as expressly set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes Collateral Agent will not be permitted to take any action under the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement until such time as it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent. With respect to any Shared Collateral, the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent is the Controlling Authorized Representative and the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date. After the earlier of (1) the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date, the Controlling Authorized Representative will be the Authorized Representative of, and the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the Collateral Agent of, the Series of First Lien Obligations (excluding the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations) that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to such Shared Collateral; provided, however, that if there are two outstanding Series of First Lien Obligations (excluding the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations) which have an equal outstanding principal amount, the Series of First Lien Obligations (excluding the First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations) with the earlier maturity date shall be considered to have the larger outstanding principal amount for purposes of the foregoing (such Authorized Representative, the “Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative”). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Discharge of First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of determining the Controlling Authorized Representative and the Controlling Collateral Agent in connection with a refinancing of such First Lien Credit Agreement Obligations with additional Obligations secured by Shared Collateral that has been designated in accordance with the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The “Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date” with respect to any Non-Controlling Authorized Representative, is the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative was the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative) after the occurrence of both (a) an Event of Default (under and as defined in the First Lien Documents under which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) and (b) each Collateral Agent’s and each other Authorized Representative’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative certifying that such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Major Non-Controlling Authorized Representative and that an Event of Default (under and as defined in the First Lien Documents under which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative) has occurred and is continuing and that the First Lien Obligations of the Series with respect to which such Non-Controlling Authorized Representative is the Authorized Representative are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents; provided that the Non-Controlling Authorized Representative Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to such Shared Collateral (1) at any time the First Lien Credit Agreement Administrative Agent or the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action with respect to a material portion of Shared Collateral or (2) at any time any grantor that has granted a security interest in such Shared Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. Except as expressly set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, only the Controlling Collateral Agent may act or refrain from acting with respect to any Shared Collateral. Except as expressly set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, while the First Lien Credit Agreement Collateral Agent is the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Notes Secured Parties may not commence any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interests in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Shared Collateral. Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing each Series of First Lien Obligations, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Shared Collateral as if such Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Shared Collateral. No Non-Controlling Authorized Representative or Non-Controlling Secured Party may contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Controlling Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party or any exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent, the Controlling Authorized Representative or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies related to the Shared Collateral. Each Collateral Agent also agrees, on behalf of itself and its related First Lien Secured Parties, that neither such Collateral Agent nor any of its related First Lien Secured Parties will ----- question or contest or support any other Person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the validity, attachment, perfection, priority or enforceability of any Lien under any First Lien Security Document of any other Series or the provisions of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement (without preventing or impairing rights to enforce the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement). Subject to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, if an event of default with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing, and the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Shared Collateral, or any distribution (including any adequate protection payments) is made in respect of any Shared Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of Holdings, the Issuer or any other grantor or any First Lien Secured Party receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Shared Collateral, the proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral by any First Lien Secured Party or received by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any First Lien Secured Party pursuant to any such intercreditor agreement with respect to such Shared Collateral and proceeds of any such distribution (subject, in the case of any such distribution, payments, or proceeds to the sentence immediately following) (all proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Shared Collateral and all proceeds of any such payment or distribution being collectively referred to as “Proceeds”), shall be applied (i) FIRST, to the payment in full in cash of all amounts owing to each Collateral Agent and each Authorized Representative (in its capacity as such) pursuant to the terms of any First Lien Document, (ii) SECOND, subject to terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, to the payment in full in cash of the First Lien Obligations of each Series on a ratable basis, with such proceeds to be applied to the First Lien Obligations of a given Series in accordance with the terms of the applicable First Lien Documents, provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to any grantor, solely as among the First Lien Secured Parties and solely for purposes of this clause SECOND and not any other First Lien Documents, in the event the value of the Shared Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of post-petition interest on the First Lien Obligations secured by the Shared Collateral to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the bankruptcy code or any other applicable provision of the bankruptcy code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of First Lien Obligations of each Series of First Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of post-petition interest on the First Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the bankruptcy code or any other applicable provision of the bankruptcy code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, and (iii) THIRD, after payment in full in cash of all First Lien Obligations, to the Issuer and the other grantors or their successors or assigns, as their interests may appear, or to whosoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may direct. If, despite the waterfall provisions above, any First Lien Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the First Lien Obligations to which it is then entitled in accordance with the waterfall provisions above, such First Lien Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in trust for the benefit of all First Lien Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with the waterfall provisions above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than any First Lien Secured Party) has a lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of First Lien Obligations, but senior (as determined by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations (such third party, an “Intervening Creditor”), the value of any Shared Collateral or proceeds which are allocated to such Intervening Creditor must be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or proceeds to be distributed in respect of the Series of First Lien Obligations with respect to which such impairment exists. Similarly, (a) if it is determined that (i) any of the First Lien Obligations of a Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations), (ii) any Series of First Lien Obligations do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of First Lien Obligations and/or (iii) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of First Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of First Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of First Lien Obligations; or (b) the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of First Lien Obligations that is not Shared Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (a) or (b) with respect to any Series of First Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series) (provided, that the existence of a maximum claim with respect to any real property subject to a mortgage which applies to all First Lien Obligations shall not be deemed to be an Impairment of any Series of First Lien Obligations), the result of such Impairment shall be borne solely by the holders of such Series of First Lien Obligation. Each Collateral Agent agrees in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, on behalf of itself and its related First Lien Secured Parties, that neither such Collateral Agent nor any of its related First Lien Secured Parties will seek to have any Shared Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any Collateral ----- Agent or any of its related First Lien Secured Parties obtains possession of any Shared Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof, at any time prior to the Discharge of each of the First Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the First Lien Secured Parties and promptly transfer such Shared Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent in the same form as received, together with any necessary endorsement, to be distributed in accordance with the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. If, at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Shared Collateral resulting in a sale or disposition thereof, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other Collateral Agent for the benefit of each Series of First Lien Secured Parties upon such Shared Collateral will automatically be released and discharged as and when, but only to the extent, such Liens of the Controlling Collateral Agent on such Shared Collateral are released and discharged; provided that any proceeds of any Shared Collateral realized therefrom shall be applied pursuant to waterfall provisions above. If the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement will provide that if the Issuer or any Guarantor, as debtor(s)-in-possession, move for approval of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (in each case, or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law), each First Lien Secured Party (other than any Controlling Secured Party or Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party) agrees not to raise any objection to any such financing or to the Liens on the Shared Collateral securing the same (the “DIP Financing Liens”) or to any use of cash collateral that constitutes Shared Collateral, unless the Authorized Representative of any Controlling Secured Party opposes or objects to such DIP Financing or such DIP Financing Liens or use of cash collateral (and (i) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens are senior to the Liens on any such Shared Collateral for the benefit of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party must subordinate its Liens with respect to such Shared Collateral on the same terms as the Liens of the Controlling Secured Parties (other than any Liens of any First Lien Secured Parties constituting DIP Financing Liens) are subordinated thereto, and (ii) to the extent that such DIP Financing Liens rank equal in priority with the Liens on any such Shared Collateral granted to secure the First Lien Obligations of the Controlling Secured Parties, each Non-Controlling Secured Party must confirm the priorities with respect to such Shared Collateral as set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement), subject to customary conditions set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement. The First Lien Secured Parties acknowledge that the First Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the then extant First Lien Documents and to the terms of the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priorities set forth in the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the First Lien Secured Parties of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.6,Security,124.6.10,Sufficiency of Collateral,"The fair market value of the Collateral is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and similar factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would also be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By their nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In addition, as discussed further below, the Holders of the Notes will not be entitled to receive post-petition interest or applicable fees, costs, expenses, or charges to the extent the amount of the obligations due under the Notes exceeds the value of the Collateral (after taking into ----- account all other first-priority debt that is also secured by the Collateral), or any “adequate protection” on account of any undersecured portion of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.6,Security,124.6.11,Certain Bankruptcy and Insolvency Limitations,"The right of the Notes Collateral Agent to foreclose upon, repossess and dispose of the Collateral upon the occurrence of an Event of Default would be significantly impaired by any bankruptcy law in the event that any bankruptcy case or other insolvency or liquidation proceeding were to be commenced by or against the Issuer or any Guarantor prior to the Notes Collateral Agent’s having repossessed and disposed of the Collateral (and in some cases, even after). Upon the commencement of a case for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (the “U.S. Bankruptcy Code”), a secured creditor such as the Notes Collateral Agent is prohibited from foreclosing upon or repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of previously repossessed security without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court and the lack of a precise definition of the meaning of “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under the Notes could be made following the commencement of a bankruptcy case (or the length of the delay in making any such payments), whether or when the Notes Collateral Agent could or would repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at any time during a bankruptcy case or whether or to what extent Holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of post-petition interest, expenses, costs and attorneys’ fees to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of such creditor’s interest in the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral. Furthermore, in the event a domestic or foreign bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Holders of the Notes would hold secured claims only to the extent of the value of the Collateral to which the Holders of the Notes are entitled, and unsecured “deficiency” claims with respect to such shortfall, which deficiency claims would not need to be adequately protected during a bankruptcy case.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Notes in a tender offer, including a Change of Control Offer, Collateral Asset Disposition Offer or Asset Disposition Offer, Notes owned by the Issuer or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer. Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below. Notice of any redemption of the Notes may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be given prior to the completion of a transaction (including an Equity Offering, an incurrence of Indebtedness, a Change of Control or other transaction) and any redemption notice may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of a related transaction. If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed.

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.11,Change of Control,124.11.1,,"The Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless a third party makes a Change of Control Offer or the Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or in the seventh paragraph under this heading “—Change of Control,” the Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of _Control Offer”) at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest,_ if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase; provided that if the date of repurchase is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose names the Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the date of repurchase. Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder of Notes at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the applicable procedures of DTC describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Indenture and described in such notice, except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control, as described below. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith. The Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. ----- Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the Notes to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The occurrence of events that would constitute a Change of Control may constitute a default under the First Lien Credit Agreement that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its subsidiaries may contain prohibitions on certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders of Notes following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by its then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may, in certain circumstances, make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the initial purchasers of the Notes and the Issuer. The Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control after the Issue Date, although it is possible that the Issuer could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the Issuer’s ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders of the Notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Notes has been given pursuant to the Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to certain Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. A sale, lease or other disposition by the Issuer of any part of its assets shall not be deemed to constitute the sale, lease or other disposition of substantially all of its assets for purposes of the Indenture if the fair market value of the assets retained by the Issuer exceeds 100% of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Notes and any other outstanding Indebtedness of the Issuer that ranks equally in right of payment with, or senior to, the Notes. This paragraph is not intended to limit the Issuer’s sales, leases or other dispositions of less than substantially all of its assets. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Any Affiliate Transaction entered into after the Reversion Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, and accordingly will be classified as permitted under clause (6) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions.” Any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to take any action described in clauses (A) through (C) of the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries” that becomes effective during the Suspension Period will be deemed to have existed on the Issue Date, and accordingly will be classified as permitted ----- under clause (1) of the second paragraph under “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries.” In addition, any future obligation to grant further Note Guarantees shall be released. All such further obligations to grant Note Guarantees shall be reinstated on the Reversion Date. No Default or Event of Default will be deemed to have occurred on the Reversion Date as a result of any actions taken by the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries during the Suspension Period. On and after each Reversion Date, the Issuer and its Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate the transactions contemplated by any contract entered into during the Suspension Period, so long as such contract and such consummation would have been permitted during such Suspension Period.

provided, that (a) if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal quarters shall have become available, the Issuer may elect, in its sole discretion, to re-determine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be the applicable LCT Test Date for purposes of such ratios, tests or baskets, (b) except as contemplated in the foregoing clause (a), compliance with such ratios, test or baskets (and any related requirements and conditions) shall not be determined or tested at any time after the applicable LCT Test Date for such Limited Condition Transaction and any actions or transaction related thereto (including acquisitions, Investments, the incurrence, issuance or assumption of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof, the incurrence or creation of Liens, repayments, Restricted Payments and Asset Dispositions) and (c) Consolidated Interest Expense for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will be calculated using an assumed interest rate as reasonably determined by the Issuer. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCT Election: (1) if any of the ratios, tests or baskets for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date have been exceeded or otherwise failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, including due to fluctuations in EBITDA or Total Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, such baskets, tests or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded or failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations; (2) if any related requirements and conditions (including as to the absence of any continuing Default or Event of Default) for which compliance or satisfaction was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date would at any time after the LCT Test Date not have been complied with or satisfied (including due to the occurrence or continuation of an Default or Event of Default), such requirements and conditions will not be deemed to have been failed to be complied with or satisfied (and such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed not to have occurred or be continuing); and (3) in calculating the availability under any ratio, test or basket in connection with any action or transaction unrelated to such Limited Condition Transaction following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement or date for redemption, purchase or repayment specified in an irrevocable notice for such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated, expires or passes (or, if applicable, the irrevocable notice is terminated, expires or passes or, as applicable, the offer in respect of an LCT Public Offer for, such acquisition is terminated), as applicable, without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, any such ratio, test or basket shall be determined or tested giving pro forma effect to such Limited Condition Transaction; (11) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of LTM EBITDA at the time of Incurrence, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of LTM EBITDA on the date of such refinancing, such percentage of LTM EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced, plus accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing; and (12) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with GAAP. ----- Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, accretion of accreted value, accretion or amortization of original issue discount, payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, payment of dividends in the form of additional Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “— Limitation on Indebtedness.” If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term debt, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit debt; provided, that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollardenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (a) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus (b) the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, dividends, premiums (including tender premiums), defeasance costs, underwriting discounts, fees, costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees) in connection with such refinancing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such respective Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or is secured by different collateral or because it is guaranteed by different obligors.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

If the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes or, if applicable, Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered pursuant to any Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer shall allocate the Excess Proceeds among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness will be selected and purchased in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Applicable Proceeds and Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the amount thereof payable in respect of the Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in U.S. dollars that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into U.S. dollars. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this covenant, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Asset Disposition is received or deemed to be received by a Foreign Subsidiary (a “Foreign Disposition”) is (x) prohibited or delayed by applicable local law, (y) restricted by applicable organizational documents or any agreement or (z) subject to other onerous organizational or administrative impediments, in each case, from being repatriated to the United States, an amount equal to the portion of such Net Available Cash so affected will not be required to be applied in compliance with this covenant, and such amounts may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary so long, but only so long, as the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or agreements or other impediments will not permit repatriation to the United States (the Issuer hereby agreeing to use reasonable efforts (as determined in the Issuer’s reasonable business judgment) to otherwise cause the applicable Foreign Subsidiary to within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required, promptly take all actions reasonably required by the applicable local law, applicable organizational impediments or other impediment to permit such repatriation), and if within one year following the date on which the respective payment would otherwise have been required such repatriation of any of such affected Net Available Cash is permitted under the applicable local law or regulation, applicable organizational documents or other impediments, such repatriation will be promptly effected and an amount equal to such repatriated Net Available Cash will be promptly (and in any event not later than five Business Days after such repatriation could be made) applied (net of additional Taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof) (whether or not such repatriation actually occurs) in compliance with this covenant and (ii) to the extent that the Issuer has determined in good faith that repatriation of, or an obligation to repatriate, any of or all the Net Available Cash of any Foreign Disposition would have an adverse Tax consequence (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes, but is not limited to, any prepayment whereby doing so the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries, any Parent Entity or any of their respective affiliates and/or equity owners would incur a tax liability, including receipt of a tax dividend, deemed dividend pursuant to Section 956 of the Code or a withholding tax), an amount equal to the Net Available Cash so affected may be retained by the applicable Foreign Subsidiary. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this covenant shall require the Issuer to cause any amounts to be repatriated to the United States (whether or not such amounts are used in or excluded from the determination of the amount of any mandatory prepayments hereunder). The non-application of any prepayment amounts as a consequence of the foregoing provisions will not, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute a Default or an Event of Default. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness or other liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) or the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness or other liability in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents, or by their terms are required to be satisfied for cash and Cash Equivalents (to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents received), in each case, within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; ----- (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of $39.75 million and 15.0% of LTM EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated NonCash Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws, rules or regulations, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith. The provisions of the Indenture relative to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of an Asset Disposition may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes. The First Lien Credit Agreement may prohibit or limit, and future credit agreements or other agreements to which the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit, the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this covenant. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, the Issuer could seek the consent of its lenders to the purchase of the Notes or could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If the Issuer does not obtain such consent or repay such borrowings, it will remain prohibited from purchasing the Notes. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any First Lien Obligations or any First Lien Intercreditor Agreement conflict with the provisions of the Indenture with respect to the application of proceeds of Asset Dispositions, the Issuer shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in the Indenture by virtue of compliance therewith.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

To the extent any such information is not so filed or furnished, as applicable, within the time periods specified above and such information is subsequently filed or furnished, as applicable, the Issuer will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations with respect thereto at such time and any Default with respect thereto shall be deemed to have been cured; provided that such cure shall not otherwise affect the rights of the Holders under “—Events of Default” if Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the total outstanding Notes have declared the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately and such declaration shall not have been rescinded or cancelled prior to such cure. In addition, to the extent not satisfied by the foregoing, the Issuer will agree that, for so long as any Notes are outstanding, it will furnish to Holders and to securities analysts and prospective investors, upon their request, the information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. ----- Substantially concurrently with the furnishing or making such information available to the Trustee pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Issuer shall also use its commercially reasonable efforts to post copies of such information required by the immediately preceding paragraph on a website (which may be nonpublic, require a confidentiality acknowledgement and may be maintained by the Issuer or a third party) to which access will be given to Holders, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes (which prospective investors shall be limited to “qualified institutional buyers” within the meaning of Rule 144A of the Securities Act or non-U.S. persons (as defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act) that certify their status as such to the reasonable satisfaction of the Issuer), and securities analysts (to the extent providing analysis of an investment in the Notes) and market making financial institutions that are reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer who agree to treat such information and reports as confidential; provided that the Issuer may deny access to any competitivelysensitive information and reports otherwise to be provided pursuant to this paragraph to any Holder, bona fide prospective investors, security analyst or market maker that is a competitor of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the extent that the Issuer determines in good faith that the provision of such information and reports to such Person would be competitively harmful to the Issuer and its Subsidiaries. To the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described in the preceding sentence after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, the Issuer shall furnish such reports to the Holders of the Notes, upon their written request. The Issuer may condition the delivery of any such reports to such Holders, prospective investors in the Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions on the agreement of such Persons to (i) treat all such reports (and the information contained therein) and information as confidential, (ii) not use such reports (and the information contained therein) and information for any purpose other than their investment or potential investment in the Notes and (iii) not publicly disclose any such reports (and the information contained therein) and information. The Issuer will also hold quarterly conference calls for the Holders of Notes, bona fide prospective investors in the Notes and securities analysts and market making financial institutions, to discuss financial information for the previous quarter (it being understood that such quarterly conference call may be the same conference call as with the Issuer’s (or as applicable, any of any Parent Entity’s) equity investors and analysts). Prior to the conference call, the Issuer will announce the time and date of such conference call and provide instructions for Holders, securities analysts, bona fide prospective investors and market making financial institutions to obtain access to such call. If the Issuer has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries and such Unrestricted Subsidiaries hold in the aggregate more than 5.0% of the Total Assets of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly information required by clauses (1) and (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant will include supplemental financial information necessary to eliminate the accounts of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries from such consolidated financial statements. The Indenture will permit the Issuer to satisfy its obligations in this covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Issuer by furnishing financial information relating to a Parent Entity; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such Parent Entity (and other direct or indirect Parent Entities included in such information, if any), on the one hand, and the information relating to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a standalone basis, on the other hand, which consolidating information need not be audited. For the avoidance of doubt, the manner in which financial information of Parent is presented in this offering memorandum shall satisfy this covenant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above, if the Issuer or any Parent Entity has furnished to the Holders of Notes or filed with the SEC the reports described in the preceding paragraphs with respect to the Issuer or any Parent Entity, the Issuer shall be deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this covenant. The Trustee shall have no duty to review or analyze any reports furnished or made available to it. Delivery of reports, information and documents to the Trustee under the Indenture is for informational purposes only and the Trustee’s receipt of such reports shall not constitute actual or constructive knowledge of the information contained therein or determinable therefrom, including the Issuer’s compliance with any of its covenants (as to which the Trustee is entitled to conclusively rely on an Officer’s Certificate).",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer determines in good faith that there is a reasonable basis to believe a Directing Holder was, at any relevant time, in breach of its Position Representation and provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer has initiated litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking a determination that such Directing Holder was, at such time, in breach of its Position Representation, and seeking to invalidate any Default, Event of Default or acceleration (or notice thereof) that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending a final and non-appealable determination of a court of competent jurisdiction on such matter. If, following the delivery of a Noteholder Direction, but prior to acceleration of the Notes, the Issuer provides to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that a Directing Holder failed to satisfy its Verification Covenant, the cure period with respect to such Default or Event of Default shall be automatically stayed and the cure period with respect to any Default or Event of Default that resulted from the applicable Noteholder Direction shall be automatically reinstituted and any remedy stayed pending satisfaction of such Verification Covenant. Any breach of the Position Representation shall result in such Holder’s participation in such Noteholder Direction being disregarded; and, if, without the participation of such Holder, the percentage of Notes held by the remaining Holders that provided such Noteholder Direction would have been insufficient to validly provide such Noteholder Direction, such Noteholder Direction shall be void ab initio (other than any indemnity such Directing Holder may have offered the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent), with the effect that such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed never to have occurred, acceleration voided and the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall be deemed not to have received such Noteholder Direction or any notice of such Default or Event of Default. Notwithstanding anything in the preceding two paragraphs to the contrary, any Noteholder Direction delivered to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, during the pendency of an Event of Default as the result of a bankruptcy or similar proceeding shall not require compliance with the foregoing paragraphs. ----- For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with the Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Officer’s Certificate delivered to it, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent shall have any liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee may declare the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under “—Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled, waived and rescinded if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, in each case, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above with respect to the Issuer occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal or interest which may only be waived with the consent of each affected Holder) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (the “Initial Default”) occurs, then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default that resulted solely because of that Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or such notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction. Neither the Trustee nor the Notes Collateral Agent will be under any obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, indemnity or security satisfactory to the Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 30% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested in writing the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered in writing and, if requested, provided to the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the written request and the offer of security or indemnity; and ----- (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a written direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent. The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and is known to a responsible officer of the Trustee, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee and Notes Collateral Agent, as applicable, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee or Notes Collateral Agent in personal liability (it being understood that the Trustee has no duty to determine if any directed action is prejudicial to any Holder). Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, each of the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it against all fees, losses, liabilities and expenses that may be caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless written notice of an event, which is in fact a Default, has been delivered to the Trustee at its office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

You should read the Indenture, the Security Documents and the First Lien Intercreditor Agreement in their entirety because they, not this description, will define your rights as Holders.

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,329,BOOK-ENTRY SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE,329.1,Depository Procedures,329.1.1,,"The following description of the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are provided solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of the respective settlement systems and are subject to changes by them. We take no responsibility for these operations and procedures and urge investors to contact the system or their participants directly to discuss these matters. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participating organizations, or collectively, the “Participants,” and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions in those securities between the Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of its Participants. The Participants include securities brokers and dealers (including the initial purchasers), banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to DTC’s system is also available to other entities such as banks, brokers, dealers, and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Participant, either directly or indirectly, or collectively, the “Indirect Participants.” Persons who are not Participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through the Participants or the Indirect Participants. The ownership interests in, and transfers of ownership interests in, each security held by or on behalf of DTC are recorded on the records of the Participants and Indirect Participants. ----- DTC has also advised us that, pursuant to procedures established by it: (1) upon deposit of the Global Notes, DTC will credit the accounts of the Participants designated by the initial purchasers with portions of the principal amount of the Global Notes; and (2) ownership of these interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of ownership of these interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to the Participants) or by the Participants and the Indirect Participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes). Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are Participants may hold their interests therein directly through DTC. Investors in the Rule 144A Global Notes who are not Participants may hold their interests therein indirectly through organizations (including Euroclear and Clearstream) which are Participants. Investors in the Regulation S Global Notes must initially hold their interests therein through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in such systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants. After the expiration of the Restricted Period (but not earlier), investors may also hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes through Participants in the DTC system other than Euroclear and Clearstream. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories, which in turn hold interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries names on the books of DTC. All interests in a Global Note, including those held through Euroclear or Clearstream, may be subject to the procedures and requirements of DTC. Those interests held through Euroclear or Clearstream may also be subject to the procedures and requirements of such systems. The laws of some states require that certain Persons take physical delivery in definitive form of securities that they own. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global Note to such Persons will be limited to that extent. Because DTC can act only on behalf of the Participants, which in turn act on behalf of the Indirect Participants, the ability of a Person having beneficial interests in a Global Note to pledge such interests to Persons that do not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interests, may be affected by the lack of a physical certificate evidencing such interests.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,329,BOOK-ENTRY SETTLEMENT AND CLEARANCE,329.2,"Except as described below, owners of interests in the Global Notes will not have notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders” thereof under the indenture for any purpose.",329.2.1,,"Payments in respect of the principal of, and interest and premium, if any, on, a Global Note registered in the name of DTC or its nominee will be payable to DTC in its capacity as the registered holder under the indenture. Under the terms of the indenture, we, the Trustee, the registrar, the paying agent and any transfer agent (together with the registrar and the paying agent, the “agents”) will treat the Persons in whose names the notes, including the Global Notes, are registered as the owners of the notes for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee, the agents nor any agent of ours or theirs has or will have any responsibility or liability for: (1) any aspect of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interest in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any of DTC’s records or any Participant’s or Indirect Participant’s records relating to the beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes; or (2) any other matter relating to the actions and practices of DTC or any of its Participants or Indirect Participants. DTC has advised us that its current practice, upon receipt of any payment in respect of securities such as the notes (including principal and interest), is to credit the accounts of the relevant Participants with the payment on the payment date unless DTC has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on such payment date. Each relevant Participant is credited with an amount proportionate to its beneficial ownership of an interest in the principal amount of the relevant security as shown on the records of DTC. Payments by the Participants and the Indirect Participants to the beneficial owners of notes will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of the Participants or the Indirect Participants and will not be our responsibility or the responsibility of DTC, the Trustee or us. Neither we, the Trustee nor the agents will be liable for any delay by DTC or any of the Participants or the Indirect Participants in identifying the beneficial owners of the notes, and we, the Trustee and the agents may conclusively rely on and will be protected in relying on instructions from DTC or its nominee for all purposes. ----- Subject to the transfer restrictions set forth under “Transfer Restrictions,” transfers between the Participants will be effected in accordance with DTC’s procedures, and will be settled in same-day funds, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the notes described herein, cross- market transfers between the Participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by their respective depositary; however, such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and procedures and within the established deadlines (Brussels time) of such system. Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to its respective depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering to or receiving from DTC interests in the relevant Global Note, and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to or from DTC, as the case may be. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the depositories for Euroclear or Clearstream. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes only at the direction of one or more Participants to whose account DTC has credited the interests in the Global Notes and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the notes as to which such Participant or Participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for legended notes in certificated form, and to distribute such notes to its Participants. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or to continue to perform such procedures, and may discontinue such procedures at any time. Neither we, the Trustee nor any of our or its agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

Beneficial interests in a Rule 144A Global Note, may be transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the Regulation S Global Note, whether before or after the expiration of the Restricted Period, only if the transferor first delivers to the Trustee a written certificate (in the form provided in the indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Rule 903 or 904 of Regulation S or Rule 144 (if available) and that, if such transfer occurs prior to the expiration of the Restricted Period, the interest transferred will be held immediately thereafter through Euroclear or Clearstream. Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the participants through the DTC Deposit/Withdraw at Custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Global Note of the type in which the interest is being transferred from and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Global Note of the type in which the interest is being transferred to, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a Person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in another Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

Those authorities may be changed, possibly with retroactive effect, or may be subject to differing interpretations, so as to result in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in this summary, and there can be no assurances that the IRS will not challenge such statements and conclusions or that any such challenge will not be sustained by a court. Moreover, this summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances, or the U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders subject to special rules, including but not limited to banks or other financial institutions, individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, brokers or dealers in securities, currencies or commodities, traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings, certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, governments, tax-exempt entities, “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” persons that will hold the notes as a part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, S corporations, partnerships or other pass-through or hybrid entities (including entities or arrangements treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) or investors therein, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, persons required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to conform the timing of income accruals to their financial statements under Section 451(b) of the Code, persons subject to the base erosion and anti-abuse tax, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar or holders that receive proceeds in the repayment in full of the Existing Credit Facilities and also purchase notes in this offering, all of whom may be subject to U.S. federal income tax rules that differ materially from those summarized below. In addition, this summary does not discuss the consequences under any U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes (such as estate or gift taxes), any foreign, state or local tax considerations or the possible application of the 3.8% tax on net investment income to Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below). If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a beneficial owner of notes, the tax treatment of notes to a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partner and the partnership. A partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) considering an investment in the notes, and partners in such a partnership, are urged to consult their tax advisors about the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, beneficially owning and disposing of the notes. For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of a note that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (1) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (2) a corporation that is created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (3) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source or (4) a trust if (a) its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more “United States persons” (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions, or (b) it has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person. A beneficial owner of a note that is neither a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) nor a U.S. Holder is referred to herein as a “Non-U.S. Holder.” THIS SUMMARY IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE TAX ADVICE. IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF NOTES, YOU SHOULD ----- CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR CONCERNING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU OF THE PURCHASE, BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES, AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES TO YOU ARISING UNDER OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS (SUCH AS ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS) AND THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION, INCLUDING ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES, OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,25,PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION,25.9,Characterization of the Notes.,25.9.1,,"In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts on the notes in excess of the stated interest and principal. See, for example, “Description of Notes—Change of Control” and “Description of Notes—Optional Redemption.” The obligation to make such payments may implicate the provisions of Treasury Regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments,” in which case the timing and amount of income inclusions and the character of income recognized may be different from the consequences discussed herein. Under these Treasury Regulations, however, one or more contingencies will not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments if, as of the issue date, such contingencies, in the aggregate, are considered remote or incidental. Although the matter is not free from doubt, we believe and intend to take the position that the potential for such additional payments on the notes should be treated as remote or incidental, in the aggregate, within the meaning of the applicable Treasury Regulations as of the issue date of the notes, and thus should not cause the notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments. Assuming such position is respected, a holder would be required to include in income any such additional amounts in accordance with such holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Our determination will be binding on a holder unless such holder explicitly discloses its contrary position on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the notes in the manner required by the applicable Treasury Regulations. Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS. It is possible, therefore, that the IRS may take a contrary position from that described above, in which case a holder could, among other things, be required to accrue ordinary interest income on the notes at a rate in excess of the stated interest rate and treat any gain recognized on the sale or other taxable disposition of a note as ordinary income rather than as capital gain. The remainder of this summary assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments.

Under ERISA and Section 4975 the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation (direct or indirect) to such an ERISA Plan, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a Plan fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Laws relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any Similar Laws, each, as applicable. Each Plan should consider the fact that none of the Transaction Parties is acting or will act as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to acquire or hold the notes pursuant to this offering and is not undertaking to provide investment advice in a fiduciary capacity or advice based on any particular investment need with respect to the decision to acquire or hold the notes pursuant to this offering. The decision to acquire or hold the notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis. “Transaction Party” means any of the Company, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates, other than an affiliate of an initial purchaser that is a named fiduciary (or a fiduciary appointed by a named fiduciary) with respect to the management of the assets of the applicable Plan and acting in accordance with an applicable individual prohibited transaction exemption (the applicable conditions of which are satisfied).",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The occurrence of a non-exempt prohibited transaction could cause an individual retirement account to lose its tax-exempt status. The acquisition and/ or holding of notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Company, the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates may be considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction in violation of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions (as amended, “PTCEs”) that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91- 38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by in-house asset managers, although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate thereof that, directly or indirectly, has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to the assets involved in the transaction) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan fiduciary has made a determination that there is adequate consideration for the transaction. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of these or any other exemption will be satisfied with respect to each transaction involving the notes. Governmental plans and certain church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws. Fiduciaries of any such Plans should consult with their counsel before purchasing any notes. ----- Because of the foregoing, any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan should not acquire or hold the notes if such acquisition or holding would constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or a violation of Similar Laws.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,942,INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS,942.3,Report of Independent Auditors,942.3.4,Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,"Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with US GAAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the consolidated financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with US GAAS, we: - Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. - Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks. ----- Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. - Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. - Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. - Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

On August 3, 2015, Wellspring Capital Partners (“Wellspring”) became the Company’s controlling member when Wellspring consummated an acquisition of the Company by purchasing a controlling interest from the prior shareholders and remained as such until October 29, 2020. On October 29, 2020 Centerbridge Partners (“Centerbridge”) and The Vistria Group (“Vistria”) jointly acquired a controlling interest in the Company (the “Transaction”) for $1,409.9 million. Centerbridge and Vistria did not previously hold any interest in the Company and a new company was not jointly created to complete the acquisition. As a result of the Transaction, Centerbridge and Vistria each acquired equal equity investments of approximately 43% (for a total of 86%) of outstanding units of the Company and have equal powers, rights, and privileges under the governing documents of the Company. The Company operates as a multi-state provider of in-home personal care services with focus on lower income individuals with complex chronic medical needs, including seniors and individuals living with disabilities. The Company provides services in various states primarily in Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and Indiana. The majority of clients are obtained and served through managed care organizations as well as Medicaid provider number arrangements and regional contracts with various state and municipal agencies and local area agencies on aging. In May 2021, the Company entered into a letter of intent with National Mentor Holdings, Inc. (“Sevita”) for the sale of substantially all of the Company’s Community Living business (the “disposal group”), which had been previously presented as a reportable segment of the Company. As a result, the components of the Community Living business that comprised the disposal group were determined to meet the accounting criteria to be presented as a discontinued operation. In August 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Sevita and in October 2021, the sale was completed for a total purchase price of $16.7 million. See Note 7 - Discontinued Operations. On January 1, 2022, the Company redefined its operating segments to include Home Care and Skilled Care. The retained components of the Community Living business, which represented the Company’s non-core businesses, were combined into Home Care for purposes of reporting and decision making by the Company’s CODM. In June 2022, the Company announced the creation of a new business - Care Coordination, which focuses on transforming the delivery of in-home personal care services, increasing access to care and improving quality and cost outcomes and increasing client satisfaction and health equity for our clients. In July 2022, the Company entered into a membership purchase agreement with Haze AcquisitionCo, LLC, for the sale of 100% of the issued and outstanding LLC membership interests of its Adaptive Hospice business for a purchase price of $10.4 million. The Adaptive Hospice business was historically reported as part of the current state Home Care operating segment. The sale closed in August 2022. In November 2022, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement for the sale of all of the interests in E3 Case Managers, LLC, Case Management IT Solutions, LLC, and Consulting Limited Inc for a purchase price of $0.3 million. Neither of the components of the Adaptive Hospice or E3 businesses met the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. Refer to Note 6 - Dispositions for further discussion. As of January 1, 2023, the Company redefined its operating segments to include Home Care and Care Coordination. Skilled Care, which was previously defined as an operating segment, was consolidated into the Home Care operating segment. As a result of the changes during the year ended December 31, 2023, Home Care was identified as the Company’s sole reportable segment. The Care Coordination operating segment will be reported as Other as it does not meet the reportable segment presentation thresholds. See Note 19 - Segment Reporting for further discussion. In September 2023, the Company exited all business operations in the Alabama market effective September 30, 2023. The component of the Alabama market did not meet the criteria to be presented as discontinued operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,942,INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS,942.14,Note 2 – Government Grants and Funding,942.14.1,,"On January 31, 2020, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared a national public health emergency due to a novel coronavirus. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by this novel coronavirus, a pandemic. In recognition of the significant threat to the liquidity of financial markets posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Trump signed into law the CARES Act, a sweeping stimulus bill intended to bolster the U.S. economy. The Payroll Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (“PPPHCE Act”) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CAA”) both expansions of the CARES Act, were signed into law on April 24, 2020 and December 27, 2020, respectively. In total, the CARES Act, the PPPHCE Act and CAA authorized $178 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers through the Provider Relief Fund. This funding was intended to support healthcare providers by reimbursing them for healthcare-related expenses or lost revenues attributable to COVID-19. _Provider Relief Funds_ The CARES Act Provider Relief Fund is designated for providers who participate in state Medicare/CHIP programs, Medicaid managed care plans, or provide dental care, as well as certain Medicare providers and is distributed through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). HHS distributed grants to healthcare providers to offset the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic related expenses and lost revenues through the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund. Grants received are subject to the terms and conditions of the program, including that such funds may only be used to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19 impacts and will reimburse only for health care related expenses, general and administrative expenses, or lost revenues that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic as defined by the HHS.

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,942,INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS,942.18,Revenue Recognition,942.18.1,,"The majority of the Company’s service revenue is generated from contracts with state, local, and other governmental agencies, managed care organizations, commercial insurers, and private consumers and is reported within the Company’s Home Care operating segment. Generally, these contracts, which are negotiated based on current contracting practices as appropriate for the payor, establish the terms of a payor relationship and set the broad range of terms for services to be performed at a stated rate. However, the contracts do not give rise to rights and obligations until an order is placed with the Company. When an order is placed, it typically creates the performance obligation to provide a defined quantity of service hours, authorized hours, or days, per client. The Company satisfies its performance obligations over time, given that clients simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company as the services are performed. ----- Customer contracts generally have an initial term of one to two years and may be terminated within 60 days’ notice. As a result, the Company is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period. As the Company has a right to consideration from customers commensurate with the value provided to clients from the performance completed over a given invoice period, the Company has elected to use the practical expedient for measuring progress toward satisfaction of performance obligations and recognizes client service revenue in the amount to which the Company has a right to invoice. The Company determines the transaction price within its customer contracts based on gross charges for services provided, adjusted by variable consideration (such as implicit price concessions). Amounts collected from all sources may be less than amounts billed due to implicit price concessions. Net service revenues are recorded net of implicit price concessions estimated based on historical collection experience to reduce revenue to the estimated amount the Company expects to collect. The estimates for implicit price concessions are based upon management’s assessment of historical write offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. The Company monitors net service revenues and collections from these sources and records any necessary adjustment to net service revenues based upon management’s assessment of historical write offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal, state and private employer health care coverage and other collection indicators. The initial estimate of net service revenues is determined by reducing the standard charge by any implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of net service revenues are generally recorded in the period of the change. Changes in estimates of implicit price concessions for performance obligations satisfied in prior years resulted in a decrease of net service revenues of $1.8 million, $11.9 million and $10.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“ASC 350”), goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, as of October 1, or whenever potential impairment triggers occur. Such events may include a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred. The Company first performs a qualitative analysis to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount and if a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. This includes a qualitative analysis of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, financial performance, fair value history and other company specific events. If this qualitative analysis, or significant adverse changes in the Company’s future financial performance, indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, the Company would then need to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company records an impairment loss based on the difference between fair value and carrying amount, not to exceed the associated carrying amount of goodwill. The Company also tests its reporting units for impairment prior to any change in reporting units in order to reallocate goodwill, if necessary, between the reporting unit components. Such reallocation is recognized as of the date of reassessment and periods prior to the reassessment are not adjusted. Acquired intangible assets subject to amortization, which include trade names, market access assets and noncompete agreements, are stated at cost and are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Intangible assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use to value an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs based on assumptions about the factors market participants would use to value an asset or liability. To measure fair value, the Company uses the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable: _Level 1 – Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 – Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as_ quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. _Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value_ of the assets or liabilities. Value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar ----- techniques and also includes instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. The carrying amounts of cash, accounts receivable, workers’ compensation collateral, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of long-term debt approximates fair value due to the variable interest rate on the Company’s long-term debt. Lease liabilities approximate fair value because those financial instruments bear interest at rates that approximate current market rates for similar agreements with similar maturities and credit. The interest rate cap agreement is valued at the present value of the estimated series of cash flows over the remaining life of the contract from the balance sheet date. Because the inputs used to value the contract can generally be corroborated by market data, the fair value is categorized as Level 2.

For HAH of Ohio LLC and its subsidiaries, the Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations.

In conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test, the Company performed a quantitative analysis for the Home Care reporting unit by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company utilized a weighted average of a discounted cash flow model and a market multiple model. Factors considered in the weighting of the discounted cash flow model and market multiple model include the size and nature of operations of the reporting unit, the availability of direct competitors and the earnings and growth of the reporting unit. The discounted cash flow method includes estimating future cash flows, a discount rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent to the business, income tax rates, and capital expenditures. The market method includes estimating future operating results, a market multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and the amount a potential acquirer would be required to pay in the form of a control premium. In conjunction with the sale of the Adaptive Hospice business in August 2022, whereby the carrying value of the total disposal group exceeded the purchase price of $10.4 million, the Company recorded impairment of $4.6 million equal to the amount of goodwill allocated to the disposal group, which is included in impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. Goodwill related to the Adaptive Hospice business was previously included in the Skilled Care reporting unit. The Company also identified impairment during its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2022. Impairment testing of the Skilled Care reporting unit showed a projected decline in operating results and cash flows due to the Company’s surrender of certain Skilled Care operating licenses and the sale of the Adaptive Hospice business. The calculated fair value of the Skilled Care reporting unit was less than its carrying value as of October 1, 2022 and recognized a full impairment of $43.4 million. The impairment was included in impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized goodwill impairment of $0.2 million which is included in impairment charges in the consolidated statement of operations and reflected within the Home Care reporting unit as a result of the combination of the reporting units that occurred on January 1, 2022. This impairment was due to declines in business performance in connection with the sale of the former Community Living operating segment. ----- The following table summarizes the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of identifiable intangible assets by major class (in thousands except for years):",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,942,INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS,942.101,Note 14 – Share-Based Compensation,942.101.1,,"On October 29, 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Unit Incentive Plan (the “Unit Incentive Plan”). Under the Unit Incentive Plan, the Company has granted awards in the form of incentive units (“Profits Interest Units”) to certain individuals. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted awards in the form of Restricted Units to certain employees. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company granted awards in the form of Awarded Class Units and Phantom Units to certain employees. _Profits Interest Units_ As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 169,134,032 and 155,662,384 Profits Interest Units were outstanding under the Unit Incentive Plan, respectively. Awards under the Unit Incentive Plan are granted on a discretionary basis and are subject to the approval of the Company’s board of managers. All Profits Interest Units (i.e., issued at closing of the Transaction or issued thereafter) will have the economic rights and entitlements in relation to other equity interests in the Company as described in the Operating Agreement. Certain Profits Interest Units granted (“Time-Vesting Units”) will vest in five (5) equal installments on the first through fifth anniversaries of the date of grant, so long as the recipient continues to provide service to the Company through the applicable vesting date. While other Profits Interest Units granted to each individual will vest upon a liquidity event based on the extent to which the distributions received by the Preferred and the Common shareholders exceed their investment in the Company (“Performance-Vesting Units”). Additionally, certain Profit Interest Unit awards contain an antidilution provision. The provision states that the participant will be entitled to additional grants in order to ensure that the participant holds 3% of the outstanding units on a fully diluted basis. These additional grants may be in the form of cash-settled liability classified Phantom Units, issued under similar terms and conditions as Profits Interest Units, should the Company and participant mutually agree that issuing Phantom Units, rather than Profits Interest Units, is more economically beneficial to the participant. Compensation expense for the Time-Vesting Units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the five-year requisite service period. Performance-Vesting Units contain market conditions and an implied performance condition, which results in compensation cost being recognized when the performance condition is considered probable of being satisfied. Performance-Vesting Units vest upon the achievement of certain liquidity events which are not considered probable until consummated. The Company’s share-based compensation expense related to the Time-Vesting Units for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, which was included in general and administrative expenses within the consolidated ----- statements of operations, was $3.0 million, $2.0 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.

The Company utilized a weighted average of a discounted cash flow model and a market model due to the lack of representative market transactions for the Company’s equity securities that existed in previous periods. The Option Pricing Method was utilized to allocate the Company’s aggregate equity value to the various classes of equity securities, including the Profits Interest Units. Per ASC 718, a change in the stock pricing model is not a change in accounting principle as the underlying objective of estimating the fair value of the award is the same. The fair value of the Profits Interest Units was determined using a Black Scholes option pricing model based on the following range of weighted average assumptions:",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
1127,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,942,INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS,942.103,Pricing Model Assumptions** **2023** **2022,942.103.1,,"Risk-free interest rate 5.03% - 5.50% 1.35% - 4.80% Expected volatility 42.5% - 50% 45% Expected life (years) 0.75 - 1 0.75 - 1 Dividend rate — — The expected volatility is based on the volatility of similar publicly traded company benchmarks within the same or similar industry as the Company and the simplified method was used to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, there was $9.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively, of unamortized sharebased compensation expense related to Time-Vesting Units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 1.7 and 2.1 years, respectively. Certain Profits Interest Units permit the recipient to require the Company to redeem the units for cash in the event of the death of the recipient. Because this contingent put right is outside the control of the Company, these instruments would be classified in temporary equity based upon their redemption value upon the grant date. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, there is no amount presented in temporary equity because the awards had no intrinsic value on the grant date. Additionally, one Profit Interest Unit agreement includes two separate awards, one of which is for up to 15.0 million units and one of which is for up to 29.7 million units, depending on certain performance criteria, however, the award that yields the lower number of units will be forfeited. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, both awards are ----- considered to be outstanding and included in the table above. There was no share-based compensation expense recognized for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 for the Performance-Vesting Units. _Restricted Units_ During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted 2,150,000 Restricted Units at a grant date fair value of $1 per unit to certain employees which vest over one-to-two years. Compensation expense for the Restricted Units is recognized ratably over the vesting period starting from the grant date. The shares fully vested in March 2023. The Company’s share-based compensation expense related to the restricted units for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, which was included in general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of operations, was $0.1 million, $0.8 million, $1.3 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made a payment of $1.7 million associated with the repurchase of 1.4 million Restricted Units. Restricted Units are assigned a fair value at the date of grant based on the Company’s estimate of the fair value per unit at the grant date. During the year end December 31, 2023, one employee’s remaining fully vested 0.8 million of Restricted Units were modified pursuant to ASC 718 as Awarded Class A units, which resulted in a change in fair value as of the modification date. As the difference between the fair value of the modified award and the fair value of the original award immediately before it was modified resulted in a decrease in fair value, no additional expense was recognized during the year ending December 31, 2023. _Awarded Class A Units_ During the year ending December 31, 2023, the Company issued a profits interest award, Awarded Class A Units. The Awarded Class A Units were modeled as a full-value award that mirrors the value of Class A units on the grant date (via a priority catch-up amount). However, the Awarded Class A units are treated as profits interest for tax purposes. On July 5, 2023, certain employees entered into an Incentive Unit Agreement, in which the employees were granted fully vested 1.3 million Awarded Class A Units at a grant date fair value of $1.50 per unit. The grant date is stated to be July 5, 2023. This award will be treated as an original issuance in the quarter and as such will be valued at the appropriate share class in the option pricing model. The Company’s share-based compensation expense related to the Awarded Class A Units for the years ended December 31, 2023, which was included in general and administrative expenses within the consolidated statements of operations, was $0.8 million. Forfeitures will occur upon termination of employment with the Company. However, all Awarded Class A units are fully vested as of the year ending December 31, 2023. _Phantom Units_ During the year ended December 31, 2023, in accordance with the terms of the settlement with the previous owners of Preferred and Edison, the equivalent value of the 7.6 million of surrendered Class A Units were granted to certain participants in the form of “Class P Units” (“Phantom Units”). The Class P Units refer to contractual units that mimic the benefits of equity ownership but carry no ownership rights. Each participant is entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the fair value of a Class A Unit as of the date of a Qualified Change in Control. However, no actual Class A Units or other equity interests have been issued, and the participant has no rights as an equity member. The units vest equally in two tranches, with 50% vesting on March 31, 2025 and the remaining 50% vesting on March 31, 2026. The vesting is subject to the participants’ continuous employment with the Company and a Qualified Change in Control. Forfeitures will occur upon termination of employment with the Company. Any Class P Units comprising the Award that have (a) not conditionally vested are automatically forfeited and (b) any Class P Units comprising the Award that have conditionally vested but are not yet fully vested, shall remain outstanding and eligible to fully vest upon a Qualifying Change of Control. ----- This award is classified as a liability award with a performance condition, which is the occurrence of the change of control. Since a change of control event is not considered probable until it occurs, the Company will not recognize any compensation expense and liability until the change of control event occurs. Phantom Units are assigned a fair value at the date of grant based on the Company’s estimate of the fair value per unit at the grant date.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

The Company records a liability related to a claim when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a loss is probable, the Company records an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. The Company maintains insurance for litigation matters with varying deductibles in different loss periods. When a loss is probable and reasonably estimated and in excess of the Company’s insurance deductible and reimbursement under an existing policy, the Company records the full expected loss as a liability and records the expected reimbursement or recovery as a receivable. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded legal settlement liabilities of $22.9 million and $25.6 million, respectively. The $22.9 million liability as of December 31, 2023 included $17.3 million from an expected legal settlement from the Preferred and Edison acquisition that was indemnifiable under the Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the settlement balance was released from escrow to the Company. The Company is in the process of negotiating settlement agreements on this matter with, among other parties, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the New York State Office of the Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice on the behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. To the extent final settlement amounts differ from the amount released from escrow, the Company expects any additional amounts, if any, to be indemnifiable under the Purchase Agreement. The $25.6 million liability as of December 31, 2022 included total legal settlement liabilities of $14.2 million which were acquired as part of the Preferred and Edison acquisition of which $7.2 million was recorded as of the date of acquisition. See Note 5 - Acquisitions. The Company maintains litigation escrows and indemnifications on these acquisitions in excess of the range of estimated exposures on these matters. The legal settlement liabilities are included within accrued expenses within the consolidated balance sheets. ----- As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded litigation insurance receivables of $3.4 million and $16.6 million, respectively, related to claims in excess of insurance policy deductibles or where other indemnity has been identified and is probable of recovery.

The Company is not aware of any additional legal proceedings or claims that it believes may have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. _Regulatory Matters_ The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government healthcare programs, together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown or unasserted at this time. The healthcare industry landscape is constantly changing. It is difficult to predict which final rules may be adopted and implemented by federal and state authorities, and if such final rules would result in any material adverse effect on the Company’s business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Management is unable to determine how any future government spending cuts will affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. There will likely continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare that, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332

The Company’s CODM is the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. Prior to January 1, 2022, the Company had previously defined its three reportable segments as Home Care, Skilled Care and Community Living. However, as noted in Note 1 – Organization and Description of Business, in conjunction with the sale of substantially all of the Company’s Community Living business (“CLS”) in 2021, discussed in Note 7 – Discontinued Operations, the Company redefined its reportable segments as Home Care and Skilled Care.

Skilled Care, which was previously defined as an operating segment, was consolidated into the Home Care operating segment. Based on the reporting and decision making of the CODM, the Company’s operating segments are Home Care (inclusive of both historical Home Care and Skilled Care operating segment) and Care Coordination. As a result of these changes, the Company’s operating segments are as follows: - Home Care - primarily focuses on unskilled services such as cleaning, bathing, dressing, and meal planning provided to elderly and disabled individuals inside their homes. Home care also includes Skilled Care, which involves skilled nursing services provided to elderly or sick individuals that require a nurse to administer. Any retained components of the CLS business, along with other non-core businesses are also included in the Home Care operating segment. - Care Coordination - focuses on transforming the delivery of in-home personal care services, increasing access to care, improving quality and cost outcomes and increasing client satisfaction and health equity for aging-in-place seniors.

The Company records a liability related to a claim when it is determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a loss is probable, the Company records an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss. The Company maintains insurance for litigation matters with varying deductibles in different loss periods. When a loss is probable and reasonably estimated and in excess of the Company’s insurance deductible and reimbursement under an existing policy, the Company records the full expected loss as a liability and records the expected reimbursement or recovery as a receivable. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded legal settlement liabilities of $20.0 million and $22.9 million, respectively. The liabilities as of both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included $17.3 million from an expected legal settlement from the Preferred and Edison acquisition that was indemnifiable under the Purchase Agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the settlement balance was released from escrow to the Company. The Company is in the process of negotiating settlement agreements on this matter with, among other parties, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the New ----- York State Office of the Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice on the behalf of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. To the extent final settlement amounts differ from the amount released from escrow, the Company expects any additional amounts, if any, to be indemnifiable under the Purchase Agreement. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded litigation insurance receivables of $7.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, related to claims in excess of insurance policy deductibles or where other indemnity has been identified and is probable of recovery. The litigation insurance and litigation escrow receivables are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held $17.3 million of unrestricted cash previously held in escrow associated with the acquisition of Preferred & Edison. The cash does not meet the definition of restricted cash, but is expected to be remitted to specified counterparties in the next 12 months. The Company is not aware of any additional legal proceedings or claims that it believes may have, individually or taken together, a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. _Regulatory Matters_ The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state, and local governments. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in expulsion from government healthcare programs, together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions unknown or unasserted at this time. The healthcare industry landscape is constantly changing. It is difficult to predict which final rules may be adopted and implemented by federal and state authorities, and if such final rules would result in any material adverse effect on the Company’s business, condensed consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Management is unable to determine how any future government spending cuts will affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. There will likely continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare that, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,332
