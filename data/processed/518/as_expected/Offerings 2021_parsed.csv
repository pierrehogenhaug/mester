This offering circular may present any of these non-GAAP financial measures on an actual historical basis, a combined historical basis or a pro forma combined basis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not considered a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and the items excluded therefrom are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to GAAP measures such as net income (loss), cash flows provided by or used in operating, investing or financing activities or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements included in this offering circular as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity. We use these non-GAAP measures in this offering circular to assess the operating results and effectiveness of the historical businesses of MCC and Fort Dearborn as well as the combined company, as the case may be. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe that investors consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance, and we believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools and should be evaluated in the context in which they are presented, and you should not consider them in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of the results of MCC, Fort Dearborn and the combined company, as the case may be, as reported under GAAP. For example, these measures: - do not reflect historical cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; - do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; - do not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay taxes; and - although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the foregoing metrics do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. Other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, these non-GAAP measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on GAAP results and using these non-GAAP measures for supplemental purposes. Additionally, these non-GAAP measures are not alternative measures of financial performance under GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with, and not as alternatives to such GAAP measures. ix ----- Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for specified periods are set forth in this offering circular under “Summary—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information,” “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information of LABL” and “Summary—Summary Historical and Pro Forma Financial Information of Fort Dearborn.” Since each of these non-GAAP financial measures is not determined in accordance with GAAP and each is susceptible to varying calculations, each such measure, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. x -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

518,Offerings 2021.md,1102,OFFERING CIRCULAR SUMMARY,1102.4,Industry Overview,1102.4.1,,"The global label industry was estimated to be approximately $41 billion in 2019 and volume is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2019 to 2024 according to Smithers Pira. Within the broader label industry, we participate in the prime label product category, which consists of labels that are used specifically to identify products on a store shelf or in a retail environment and play a key role in “front-of-line” branding and shelf appeal. Based on findings from a third-party consulting firm and industry research, we estimate a global addressable market for prime labels of approximately $31 billion in 2019, and across North America and Europe, we estimate an addressable market of approximately $16 billion in 2019. We believe prime labels are one of the most important and recognizable components of product identity and are key drivers of consumer preference and loyalty across a wide spectrum of consumerfacing end categories and applications. Prime labels are also used to convey consumer-related information, to provide a means of ensuring product integrity and security, and also to meet regulatory requirements. Prime labels comprise a very small percentage of overall customer product cost, estimated at approximately 1-3% for CPG products. Low cost-to-value, high manufacturing and service complexity, and criticality of supply, coupled with significant portions of revenue under contract, result in enduring customer relationships among leading global prime label manufacturers. Prime label manufacturers benefit from multiple dynamics that have a positive impact on pricing and mix. We believe trends toward increased premiumization, SKU redesign velocity and proliferation, and lead-time and order size variability will continue to manifest in average prime label unit price growth. These positive trends are driven in large part by customers’ marketing departments, which continue to demand more premium labeling solutions, including foils, embossing, and etching, and consistently redesign SKUs, typically 2-3 times per year for seasonal and promotional items, enabling prime label suppliers to drive pricing improvement over the life of a contract. The growth in label redesigns is driven by increased market demand for customization, brand premiumization, sustainable 11 ----- 12 ----- 13 ----- single-use plastics consumption is expected to continue to result in lower prime label demand; however, the combined company is relatively insulated from this headwind as it has lower exposure to single-use plastics than the overall prime label industry and has minimal exposure to clear water, the most impacted product category. Overall, we believe that the accelerating trend toward more sustainable offerings represents limited risk to prime label volume demand, while introducing multiple opportunities for leading prime label suppliers to provide innovative higher-priced products with accretive financial contribution. The global prime labels industry remains highly fragmented, with single plant manufacturers operating in a local market, or multi-plant manufacturers operating in certain regions, constituting the majority of industry capacity, with relatively few global manufacturers. We believe that this highly fragmented market will continue to experience consolidation as suppliers attempt to realize the benefits to scale in prime label manufacturing, across sourcing, operations, and organic growth and share gain, and as global customers continue to consolidate their prime label spend volume across leading global suppliers. We believe these factors have resulted in leading global prime label manufacturers historically taking share vis-à-vis smaller and mid-sized competitors, resulting in long-term abovemarket growth, a trend that we believe will continue to benefit leading global prime label manufacturers. Overall, we believe the global prime label manufacturing industry is highly attractive and that our combined company is well-positioned as the global leader.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Further, we believe that we hold number one or number two positions in each of the key label technologies and end categories we serve across North America and Europe. We believe our leading global position and scale in a highly fragmented industry provide advantages in comparison with smaller national, regional and local competitors. These advantages span procurement and sourcing, operational efficiency, and organic growth and share gain.

We believe our comprehensive combined fleet of label converting technologies will allow us to improve operating efficiency by driving down conversion costs via better alignment of order volume to the optimal equipment, in addition to enabling load-balancing across our combined manufacturing network to improve throughput and utilization. Leading global prime label manufacturers have exhibited a long track-record of above-market growth (approximately two-times the underlying addressable market) and organic share gain.

Our platform consists of state-of-the-art printing presses and a global footprint across 95 strategically located manufacturing facilities that enable us to effectively service customers of all sizes, ranging from the largest multi-national customers in the world to small local accounts. We believe our approximately 12,500 employees globally provide us with unmatched local presence in key geographic regions and that our scaled global platform allows us to remain close to our customers in multiple regions, drive responsive customer service, attain superior lead times and offer increased flexibility and frequent collaboration in R&D and operational efforts. We are able to deliver multiple product types to our customers from multiple facilities, and in some instances, we embed employees in our customers’ facilities to ensure the highest level of customer support. We provide a full complement of label converting technologies including flexographic, lithographic, rotogravure, combination / screen, and digital, plus in-house pre-press services, which we believe differentiate us from our competitors and position us to serve customers across a wide variety of SKUs. Our recent investments in state-of-the-art printing presses and digital printing capabilities have strengthened our leadership in technology and manufacturing capabilities. Since 2018, we have invested over $300 million in capital expenditures to support our growing sales pipeline. We have invested significant resources in commercial excellence and adhere to a targeted growth strategy predicated on capitalizing on significant share-of-wallet opportunities with existing customers, targeting attractive high growth and margin exposures, continuing to broaden our highergrowth emerging market footprint, utilizing sales continuous improvement to better serve regional customers, and leveraging e-commerce and digital printing capabilities to unlock smaller customers via lower cost to serve. We believe our best-in-class commercial systems, including customized lead generation and sales analytics capabilities, represent a key competitive differentiator and will allow us to execute on our targeted growth strategy. In addition to meaningful expected cost synergies, we believe our deep focus on operational excellence and significant identified “in-flight” cost savings, coupled with a well-executed topline growth strategy, will enable us to deliver long-term profitable growth across our global platform and customer base. On a combined basis, we have a track record in recent years of exceeding our targeted acquisition synergy and cost saving targets by greater than 20%, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to drive identified margin improvements. Furthermore, we believe that on a combined basis we will be well-positioned to execute against a clear set of identified commercial and operational levers to close the meaningful addressable margin and organic growth gap relative to CCL’s prime labels business, which has demonstrated a long-term track record of above-market growth and best-in-class margins, based on our greater combined scale and relative exposures and capabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Specifically, we believe the combination will generate run-rate cost synergies of approximately $150 million, which are expected to be driven primarily by procurement savings, efficiencies in selling, general, and administrative expense, manufacturing footprint consolidation, and operational improvements including material waste reduction and in-sourcing, among others. In addition to the identified cost synergies, we believe there are several other meaningful operational improvement opportunities, as reflected by approximately $84 million of “in-flight” cost savings initiatives identified by Management across the combined business, expected to be driven by cost synergy realization from previously completed acquisitions, continuous improvement and lean manufacturing, procurement, capital productivity, and other identified initiatives.

Since 2019, the year in which Multi-Color completed its merger with W/S Packaging, Multi-Color has demonstrated revenue growth and margin improvement driven by penetration of higher growth geographies and the realization of identified cost synergies and other operational improvements. Over the comparable time period, Fort Dearborn has delivered strong revenue growth, driven by share gain and onboarding of new customer wins, and significant margin expansion from productivity and procurement initiatives, while making meaningful investments in selling, general, and administrative expense. Each company benefits from the contractual pass-through of raw material cost inflation across a majority of net revenues, which results in long-term earnings stability across periods of inflation and deflation. This dynamic is evidenced by $25 million in aggregate Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA contribution from executed pricing actions net of cost inflation as of June 30, 2021 across Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn. We believe the combination of Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn and the associated cost synergy opportunities, in addition to “in-flight” cost savings, will further improve our combined financial profile, and we have a demonstrated track record of exceeding our cost synergy and savings targets historically. On a combined basis, we have demonstrated strong free cash flow conversion despite meaningful historical investments to support future growth. We estimate that maintenance capital expenditures will only amount to approximately 1-2% of net revenues per annum and believe that our 17 ----- growth and productivity capital expenditures exhibit attractive return on capital profiles.

Hexagon specializes in manufacturing high-margin PSL, in addition to producing SS labels and linerless wraps, utilizing specialized narrow-web label converting capabilities. We believe Hexagon holds the #1 position in New Zealand and is complemented by a high-growth platform in Australia, serving a broad range of end categories including F&B, W&S, and Specialty (primarily healthcare). We believe Hexagon is highly complementary to Multi-Color, and combining the companies creates the clear market leader in Australia and New Zealand and provides a meaningful cost synergy opportunity. The acquisition of Hexagon closed on September 30, 2021. On September 30, 2021, Multi-Color also announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Skanem. Founded in 1905 and headquartered in Stavanger, Norway, Skanem is a leading provider of prime labels in Northern Europe and Thailand with $123 million in net revenues and $17 million in Adjusted EBITDA for the LTM Period. Skanem specializes in PSL, which represent the vast majority of net revenues, across a full range of converting technologies. We believe Skanem holds the #1 position in Northern Europe, is complemented by a high-growth platform in Southeast Asia, and further benefits from its low-cost manufacturing platform in Poland, which serves Europe more broadly. Skanem’s customers span a broad range of end categories including HPC, F&B, and Specialty, and we believe Skanem’s strong HPC position in Europe is highly complementary to Multi-Color’s strong presence and customer base in HPC in North America. Further, Skanem’s Thailand operation provides Multi-Color’s existing presence in the region with additional scale in this sizeable and growing developing market, and we believe that overall, there is a meaningful cost synergy opportunity from the combination. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2021. However, there is no guarantee that this transaction will close within this timeframe or at all. 20 ----- 21 ----- year due to isolated operating inefficiencies resulting from COVID-related absenteeism and prior consolidation of select plants, both of which are expected to be temporary and are being mitigated with plans in place. European beverage categories and IML are experiencing softness relative to strong demand in the comparable prior year period. Developing markets continue to exhibit strong revenue growth, partially offset by discrete, unforeseen factors, including COVID-related lockdowns in Asia and restricted trade into China. FX translation is expected to be favorable. For the three-month period ended September 30, 2021, Multi-Color Adjusted EBITDA is expected to decline relative to the three months ended September 30, 2020 primarily driven by transitory issues. Significant raw material inflation has impacted earnings in the quarter as the pass-through of price increases has temporarily lagged inflation. This dynamic is expected to be transitory given contractual pass-through pricing mechanisms inherent to our business model, and we expect to more than recover cost inflation as evidenced by approximately $8 million of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA contribution from pricing execution net of cost inflation expected as of the LTM Period, which we expect to increase for the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2021. Higher labor costs are also anticipated to pressure results primarily due to the temporary duplication of resources related to isolated prior plant closures and inefficiencies due to COVID-induced challenges related to recruitment, retention and training in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the latter of which have impacted global manufacturers more broadly. Additionally, temporary destocking of European beverage inventories and less favorable IML mix are expected to contribute to lower earnings. In North America, key leading indicators of underlying operating performance, including backlogs and on-time delivery rates, are trending favorably across the isolated plants that have been most impacted by operating inefficiencies as a result of COVID and prior plant closures. We believe this observed improvement, coupled with strong pricing execution, will result in improved earnings momentum, given underlying topline growth.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

This strong expected performance is mainly driven by the successful onboarding of identified new customer wins, primarily in Shrink Sleeve and Roll-Fed, and strong pricing execution, which are expected to be partially offset by declines in C&S related to certain food categories that exhibited COVID-related demand increases in the prior year, as well as headwinds from destocking and mix. Relative to pre-COVID levels in 2019, demand for certain end categories positively impacted by COVID remains higher to-date, which we believe will be sustained by shifts in consumer purchasing behavior.

Continued strong realization of “in-flight” cost savings initiatives and synergies from prior M&A in addition to contribution from onboarding of profitable new customer wins are expected to be partially offset by the impact of destocking and mix.

These difficulties include: - the challenge of integrating MCC and Fort Dearborn while also effectively carrying on the ongoing operations of each business; - the challenge of consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; - the challenge of integrating the business cultures and employees of each company; - the challenge of consolidating sales and marketing operations; - the difficulties in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; - the challenge of optimizing our geographic footprint, particularly in areas of geographic overlap; - the challenges associated with realizing anticipated synergies through supplier negotiations, reductions in headcount, consolidation or integration of facilities or other cost savings initiatives, including challenges related to achieving procurement savings and any business interruption or unexpected employee turnover that may result from the implementation of identified initiatives; - the challenges of managing customer relationships smoothly and maintaining customer accounts, particularly in instances where both companies serve the same customer; - difficulties encountered in any internal reorganization that we may undertake after the Transactions; - the challenges in managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating operations; - the challenge and cost of integrating the IT, financial management systems and internal controls of each company; and - the potential difficulty in identifying and retaining key officers and sales personnel of MCC and Fort Dearborn. The process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of MCC’s or Fort Dearborn’s existing businesses and may require us to incur substantial costs. Members of senior management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time and attention to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage the 50 ----- combined company, service existing customers, attract new customers, develop new products or strategies and manage risk. If senior management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.

Our success in realizing these benefits depends on the successful integration of the respective MCC and Fort Dearborn businesses and operations. Even if we are able to integrate MCC and Fort Dearborn, and implement the identified synergy realization plan, the integration may not result in the full realization of the cost synergies and growth opportunities that we currently expect within the anticipated time frame, or at all. If the anticipated cost synergies and growth opportunities are not realized, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.

To enable this, we must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner, or enhance existing products and services, to keep pace with technological and regulatory developments and achieve customer acceptance. Any failure on our part to predict future customer and market demands or end user preferences and develop and deliver new product and service offerings in response, could place pressure on our pricing strategies and impact our ability to compete effectively. Specifically, in recent times, customers and consumers are seeking more sustainable product offerings using recyclable components and enabling circularity in product use. If we are unable to offer such products, in circumstances where our competitors can, we may experience a decrease in the demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The global labels industry is constantly evolving based on both industry-member and consumer preferences. The products and services that we provide may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve. As a result, our customers may decide to change or decrease their product usage or forego the use of certain products and services entirely. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, net revenues and results of operations. We must continually invest in new product and service offerings to meet the evolving demands of our customers. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in the introduction, marketing and 52 ----- adoption of any of our new products or services. Additionally, we may sustain undue financial loss if a substantial investment in the development of a new product or service fails. Regulatory developments can also significantly alter the market for our products and services. For example, a move to electronic distribution of disclaimers and other paperless regimes could negatively impact our healthcare inserts and labels businesses by fundamentally reducing the demand for these products.

These employees have industry experience and relationships that we rely on to successfully implement our business plan. The success of our business is heavily dependent on our ability to retain our current management and to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. Competition for senior management personnel is intense, and we may not be able to retain our personnel. We have not entered into employment agreements with all of our key personnel, and these individuals may not continue in their present capacity with us for any particular period of time.

In addition, our expectations regarding the earnings, operating cash flow, capital expenditures and liabilities resulting from recently completed acquisitions are based on information currently available to us and may prove to be incorrect. If we are unable to manage expected future expansion, or if our long-term growth strategy is not successful, our ability to provide a high-quality customer experience could be harmed, which could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and results of operations.

We may become responsible for unanticipated liabilities and contingencies that we failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence in connection with historical acquisitions or any future acquisitions. We have typically required sellers to indemnify us against certain undisclosed liabilities. However, we cannot assure you that indemnification rights we have obtained, or will in the future obtain, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any of these liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we have completed many acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates, acquire possible acquisition candidates, acquire such candidates on commercially reasonable terms, or integrate acquired businesses successfully in the future. Furthermore, because of the limitations imposed by the agreements governing our indebtedness, we may not be able to finance future acquisitions. Any governmental review or investigation of our proposed acquisitions, such as by the Federal Trade Commission or the European Commissioner for Competition, may impede, limit or prevent us from proceeding with an acquisition. Future acquisitions may require us to incur additional debt and contingent liabilities, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 54 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The costs of such integration could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, the process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in operating, contract and supply chain difficulties, such as the failure to retain customers or management personnel. Although we conduct what we believe to be a prudent level of investigation regarding the businesses we purchase, in light of the circumstances of each transaction, an unavoidable level of risk remains regarding the actual condition of these businesses. Until we actually assume operating control of such businesses and their assets and operations, we may not be able to ascertain the actual value or understand the potential liabilities of the acquired entities and their operations. The benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of our acquisitions will depend in part on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities, cost savings and synergies. Our success in realizing these opportunities and synergies, and the timing of this realization, depends on the successful integration of the acquired businesses and operations with our business and operations and the adoption of best practices. Even if we are able to integrate these businesses and operations successfully, this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities and synergies we currently expect from this integration within the anticipated timeframe, or at all. Accordingly, the benefits from these acquisitions may be offset by unanticipated costs or delays in integrating the companies. Furthermore, we may not realize all of the cost savings and synergies we expect to achieve from our current operational improvement initiatives due to a variety of risks, including, but not limited to, difficulties in integrating shared services within our business, higher than expected employee severance or retention costs, higher than expected overhead expenses and expenses related to facilities closures, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost savings plans and other unexpected costs associated with operating our business.

Demand for our products is principally driven by consumer consumption of the products sold in the packages or with the inserts and labels we produce, which is affected by general economic conditions and changes in consumer preferences. Our primary end categories are Food & Beverage, Wine & Spirits, Home & Personal Care and Specialty. Decreases in global economic activity, including reductions in business and consumer spending, may result in downturns or periods of economic weakness in our primary end categories. In turn, we may experience decreased demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and cash flows. Similarly, reduced global economic activity may affect our customers’ businesses, compelling them to reduce their spending on advertising and premiumization. This has led, and may in the future lead, to diminished demand for our products and services, which could result in reductions in net revenues, operating margins, earnings and growth rates, as well as difficulty in managing inventory levels and collecting accounts receivable. Economic downturns may also result in restructuring actions and associated expenses and the impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles. Uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Additionally, economic downturns may affect one or more of our lenders’ ability to fund future draws on our Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility or our Senior Cash Flow Revolving Credit Facility and our ability to access the capital markets or obtain new financing arrangements that are favorable to us. In such an event, our liquidity could be constrained with an adverse impact on our ability to operate our businesses.

We routinely incur costs in complying with these regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, or prohibitions on importing or exporting. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or concerns about product safety, also may lead to product recalls or post-manufacture repairs of selected products, resulting in the rejection of our products by our customers and consumers, lost sales, increased customer service and support costs, and costly litigation. In addition, failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down one or more of our facilities. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations because legal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance with these requirements, or the effect on our operations, any of which may be significant.

Violations of these laws and regulations or of any conditions contained in any environmental permit can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution or other controls or equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations or facility shutdowns. In addition, in the course of our operations, we use, store and dispose of hazardous substances. Certain of our facilities and operations require environmental permits or other approvals from governmental authorities, and certain of these permits and approvals are subject to expiration, denial, revocation or modification under various circumstances. We are also subject to frequent inspections and monitoring by government enforcement authorities. Compliance with these laws, regulations, permits and approvals is a significant factor in our business. From time to time we incur, and may in the future incur, significant capital and operating expenditures to achieve and maintain compliance with applicable environmental laws, regulations, permits and approvals. Our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations or permit or approval requirements could result in substantial civil or criminal fines or penalties or enforcement actions, including regulatory or judicial orders enjoining or curtailing operations or requiring remedial or corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other actions or costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 65 ----- In addition, as an owner and operator of real estate, we may be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for the investigation, remediation and monitoring, as well as associated costs, expenses and third-party damages, including tort liability and natural resource damages, relating to past or present releases or threats of releases of regulated materials at, on, under or from our properties. Liability under these laws may be imposed without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of those materials on our property; may be joint and several, meaning that the entire liability may be imposed on each party without regard to contribution; and may be retroactive and may not be limited to the value of the property. In addition, we or others may discover new material environmental liabilities, including liabilities related to third-party owned properties that we or our predecessors formerly owned or operated, or at which we or our predecessors have disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, certain regulated materials. We may be involved in administrative or judicial proceedings and inquiries in the future relating to such environmental matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Some of our current and former facilities are currently involved in environmental remediation resulting from releases of hazardous substances or the presence of other regulated materials. Many of our facilities have a history of industrial usage for which investigation and remediation obligations could arise in the future and which could require us to make material expenditures or otherwise materially affect the way we operate our business. Certain of our operations result in emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”), such as carbon dioxide. Growing concern about the sources and impacts of global climate change has led to a number of national and supranational legislative and administrative measures, both proposed and enacted, to monitor, regulate and limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions, including in the United States. Such measures, for example, could adversely affect our energy supply, or the costs and types of raw materials we use for fuel, or impose costs on us associated with GHG emissions resulting from our operations. Although we believe it is likely that GHG emissions will continue to be regulated in the United States and elsewhere in the future, we cannot yet predict the form such regulation will take (such as a cap-and-trade program, technology mandate, emissions tax or other regulatory mechanism) or, consequently, estimate the direct or indirect financial impact to our business. In addition, the physical impacts of climate change may have an adverse impact on our operations and facilities, including to the extent extreme weather events result in physical damage to our facilities, the availability or safety of our workforce, fluctuations or limitations on energy supply, supply-chain disruptions, delays in manufacturing or restrictions on availability of raw materials or the availability of water. Such disruptions can result in a material adverse impact, including loss of customers. New environmental laws or regulations (or changes in existing laws or regulations or their enforcement) may be enacted that require significant expenditures by us. If the resulting expenses significantly exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign requirements concerning safety and health conditions at our manufacturing facilities, including those promulgated by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). The operation of manufacturing facilities involves many risks, including the failure or substandard performance of equipment, suspension of operations and new governmental statutes, regulations, guidelines and policies. Our and our customers’ operations are also subject to various hazards incidental to the production, use, handling, processing, storage and transportation of certain 66 ----- hazardous materials. These hazards can cause personal injury, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage. Furthermore, we may become subject to claims with respect to workplace exposure, workers’ compensation and other matters. We may be subject to material financial penalties or liabilities for noncompliance with safety and health requirements, as well as potential business disruption, if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any significant injury or any noncompliance with applicable requirements. At the E.U. level, many laws and regulations are designed to protect human health and the environment. For example, Directive 2004/35/EC concerns obligations to remedy damages to the environment, which could require us to remediate contamination identified at sites we own or use. Other E.U. directives limit pollution from industrial activities, reduce emissions to air, water and soil, protect water resources, reduce waste, protect employee health and safety and regulate the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals. Failure to comply with these laws, or a change in the applicable legal framework, could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We could be held liable for the costs to address contamination at any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site. We also could incur fines, penalties, sanctions or be subject to third-party claims for property damage, personal injury or nuisance or otherwise as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials. Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including additional investigation or other obligations with respect to any potential health hazards of our products or business activities or the imposition of new permit requirements, may lead to additional compliance or other costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Approximately 47% of our sales on a pro forma combined basis were derived from our foreign operations (based on the country from which the product was shipped) during the last twelve months ended June 30, 2021. As a result, our business is exposed to risks inherent in foreign operations, particularly as we expand our operations through organic growth and acquisitions. These risks, which can vary substantially by jurisdiction, include the difficulties associated with managing an organization with operations in multiple countries, compliance with differing laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and local laws prohibiting payments to government officials and other corrupt practices, tax laws, regulations and rates), enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems. We are also at risk of our employees, contractors and agents violating such policies. Any such violations could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including material fines, onerous compliance requirements, prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, reputational damage and loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks include the potential for restrictive actions by foreign governments, changes in economic conditions in each market, foreign customers who may have longer payment cycles than 67 ----- customers in the United States, the impact of economic, political and social instability of those countries in which we operate, regulatory change, government nationalization of certain industries, currency controls and acts of nature, such as typhoons, tsunamis, or earthquakes. The overall volatility of the economic environment has increased the risk of disruption and losses resulting from hyperinflation, currency devaluation and tax or regulatory changes in certain countries in which we have operations. We also face the challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may subject us to a relatively high risk of political and social instability and economic volatility, all of which are enhanced, in many cases, by uncertainties as to how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. We cannot predict whether the countries in which our products are sold or manufactured, or may be sold or manufactured in the future, will be subject to new or additional trade restrictions or sanctions imposed by the U.S. or other governments. Trade restrictions (including new or increased tariffs, quotas, embargoes, sanctions, safeguards and customs restrictions) against the products we sell, as well as foreign labor strikes, work stoppages or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of the products available to us and to our suppliers, and may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The United Kingdom left the E.U. on January 31, 2020. On January 1, 2021, the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the “TCA”) became effective. The TCA provides preferential access to the United Kingdom and to E.U. members to each other’s markets, without tariffs or quotas on imported products between the jurisdictions. However, economic relations between the United Kingdom and the E.U. will now be on more restricted terms than existed prior to Brexit. It is difficult to predict the severity of the impact of these changes on our United Kingdom and E.U. based operations. Goods moving between the United Kingdom and any member of the E.U. will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible higher transportation and regulatory costs, as well as delays at ports of entry and departure. Such delays could adversely impact elements of our supply chain and also our ability to meet customers’ delivery schedules. The United Kingdom has yet to determine which E.U. laws and regulations to replace or replicate and compliance with any amended or additional laws and regulations could increase our costs. To the extent that higher costs are incurred which cannot be passed on to our customers, this could decrease the profitability of our United Kingdom and E.U. operations. Brexit has also given rise to calls from the governments of other E.U. member states to consider withdrawal. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global market liquidity and restrict the ability of key market participants to operate in certain financial markets. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the fact that we have operations located within the United Kingdom, Brexit could negatively impact our operations resulting primarily from (a) operational disruptions due to changes in 68 ----- the manner in which people and products are moved between the United Kingdom and E.U. following Brexit and, (b) potential price increases for supplies purchased by our United Kingdom businesses from companies located in the E.U. or elsewhere.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

In the E.U. and the European Economic Area (the “E.E.A.”), we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in relation to our collection, control, processing, sharing, disclosure and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable natural person). We may process personal data in relation to our employees, customers, business partners, distributers, suppliers and other third parties. The GDPR imposes restrictions on the collection and use of personal data that, in many respects, are more stringent, and impose more significant burdens on businesses subject to the GDPR, than current privacy standards in the United States. The GDPR imposes a strict data protection compliance regime including: providing detailed guidance regulating how personal data is to be collected and processed; demonstrating that valid consent or another appropriate legal basis is in place or otherwise exists to justify data processing activities; granting new rights for data subjects in regard to their personal data (including the right to be “forgotten” and the right to data portability), as well as enhancing current rights (e.g., data subject access requests); introducing the obligation to notify data protection regulators or supervisory authorities (and in certain cases, affected individuals) of significant data breaches; defining for the first time pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data; imposing limitations on the retention of personal data; maintaining a record of data processing; and complying with the principal of accountability and the obligation to demonstrate compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit. Other countries have enacted or are considering enacting data localization laws that require certain data to stay within their borders. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations that could result in the imposition of penalties or fines. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such laws, regulations and policies that are applicable to us may limit the use and adoption of our products and solutions and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We are also subject to E.U. rules with respect to cross-border transfers of personal data out of the E.U. and E.E.A. Where we transfer personal data out of the E.U. or E.E.A. to countries which are not considered by the European Commission to offer adequate protection of personal data, we comply with the relevant E.U. data export requirements from time to time, including entering into the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the model clauses), and in regard to transfers of personal data (HR data and non-HR data) to the United States. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. There is a risk that third party providers may process data in violation of our privacy obligations or lack sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place to ensure compliance. Any violation of data or security laws by our third-party processors could have a material adverse effect on our business and result in fines and penalties. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, whether through system failure or breaches or employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers. Specifically, any failure to comply with our obligations under the GDPR may result in substantial fines up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total global annual turnover. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, orders to 69 ----- cease or change our processing of our data, enforcement notices, assessment notices (for a compulsory audit), as well potential civil claims including class action type litigation where individuals suffer harm. The GDPR is directly applicable in each E.U. and E.E.A. Member State and provides that each Member State may establish further conditions, limitations and regulations in relation to personal data. Any expansion of our privacy obligations may limit our ability to collect, control, process, share, disclose and otherwise use personal data or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. We are also subject to evolving E.U. privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. The E.U. is in the process of replacing the e-Privacy Directive with a new set of rules taking the form of a regulation. The draft e-Privacy Regulation imposes strict opt-in marketing rules with limited exceptions for business-to-business communications, alters rules on third-party cookies, web beacons and similar technology and significantly increases fining powers to the same levels as the GDPR (i.e. the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of total global annual turnover). While the e-Privacy Regulation was originally intended to be adopted on May 25, 2018 (alongside the GDPR), it is still going through the European legislative process and commentators now expect it to be adopted during 2023, following a transition period.

Fort Dearborn’s goodwill and intangible assets represented approximately 36% of Fort Dearborn’s total assets as of June 30, 2021. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We evaluate intangible assets for impairment when facts or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Our 70 ----- evaluation of impairment requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions, including projections of future results. Such estimates and assumptions may not prove to be accurate in the future. After performing our evaluation for impairment, including an analysis to determine the recoverability of intangible assets, we will record a noncash impairment loss when the carrying value of the underlying asset, asset group or reporting unit exceeds its fair value. There can be no assurance that reviews of our goodwill and other intangible assets will not result in impairment losses. During the early years of an acquisition, the risk of impairment to goodwill and intangible assets is naturally higher. This is because the fair values of these assets align very closely with what we recently paid to acquire the reporting units to which these assets are assigned. This means the difference between the carrying value of the reporting unit and its fair value (typically referred to as “headroom”) is naturally smaller at the time of acquisition. Until this headroom grows over time (due to business growth or lower carrying value of the reporting unit due to natural amortization, etc.), a relatively small decrease in reporting unit fair value can trigger an impairment. That fair value is affected by actual business performance but is also determined by the market (usually reflected in the value of our common stock). As a consequence, sometimes even with favorable business performance, the market alone can drive an impairment condition if general business valuations decline significantly. When impairment charges are triggered, they tend to be material due to the sheer size of the assets involved. If these impairment losses are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The borrowing base availability under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility is estimated to be approximately $365.0 million as of the closing date. Actual amounts of such other indebtedness outstanding upon the closing of the MCC Acquisition may vary. Our substantial indebtedness may have important consequences for us and the holders of the Notes. For example, it may: - make it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness, including the Notes; - increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions and periods of significant inflation and financial market volatility; - expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because any borrowings we make under the Senior Cash Flow Revolving Credit Facility and the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility and our borrowings under the Senior Term Loan Facility under certain circumstances, will bear interest at variable rates; - require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness including the MCC Existing Notes, the Notes, the Senior Cash Flow Credit 71 ----- Facilities and the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other expenses; - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; - increase our cost of future borrowing; - place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; - limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness to finance future acquisitions; - limit our ability to refinance indebtedness and increase the associated costs of our indebtedness; and - limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.

While the relevant laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the incurrence of the obligations in respect of the Notes and the guarantees and, in the case of the Secured Notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens, will generally be a fraudulent conveyance or a fraudulent transfer if (i) the transactions relating to the issuance of the Notes or guarantees or, in the case of the Secured Notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens, were undertaken with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding other creditors or (ii) we or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors, as applicable, received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in exchange for issuing either the Notes or a guarantee or, in the case of the Secured Notes and the related guarantees, the granting of liens and, in the case of (ii) only, any one of the following is also true: - we or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes and the related guarantees); - the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of the guarantees (or the related security interests with respect to the Secured Notes and the related guarantees) left us or such Subsidiary Guarantor with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; or - we or such Subsidiary Guarantor intended to, or believed that we, or such Subsidiary Guarantor, would, incur debts beyond our or its ability to pay as they mature. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is satisfied. A court would likely find that we or a Subsidiary Guarantor thereof did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the Notes or such guarantee and/or lien if we or a Subsidiary Guarantor did not substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the Notes or the applicable guarantee and/or lien. Thus, if the guarantees were legally challenged, any guarantee could be subject to the claim that, since the 80 ----- guarantee was incurred for our benefit, and only indirectly for the benefit of the Subsidiary Guarantor, the obligations of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor were incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration. Therefore, a court could avoid the obligations under the guarantees (and any related liens in the case of the Secured Notes), subordinate them to the applicable Guarantor’s other debt or take other action detrimental to the holders of the Notes, including requiring the return of amounts previously paid to such holders. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the law of the jurisdiction that is being applied, such that we cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not any such issuer or Subsidiary Guarantor was insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the Notes or the guarantees would be subordinated to such issuer’s or any of the Subsidiary Guarantor’s other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes or the incurrence of a guarantee or, in the case of the Secured Notes and the related guarantees, the grant of liens was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could avoid the payment obligations under the Notes or that guarantee, could subordinate the Notes or that guarantee to presently existing and future indebtedness of the applicable obligor under the Notes or could require the holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or that guarantee or, in the case of the Secured Notes and the related guarantees, avoid the granting of liens to secure the Secured Notes or the related guarantees. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred you may not receive any repayment on the Notes and could even be required to return amounts you had previously received. Further, the avoidance of the Notes could result in an event of default with respect to our and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt. Although the indentures that will govern the Notes will contain a “savings clause” intended to limit a Subsidiary Guarantor’s liability under its guarantee to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law, this provision may not be effective as a legal matter to protect those guarantees from being avoided under fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer law or otherwise, or, if effective, may reduce that Guarantor’s obligation to an amount that effectively makes its guarantee worthless.

Consequently, liquidating the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Secured Notes. Our obligations under the Cash Flow Credit Agreement and the MCC 2026 Notes are secured by the Collateral ratably with our obligations under the Secured Notes. Our obligations under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility are secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a senior basis with respect to our obligations under the Secured Notes and on a junior basis with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. As a result, upon any distribution to our creditors, foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings, or following acceleration of our indebtedness or an event of default under our indebtedness, the lenders under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral before any payment is made to holders of the Secured Notes from the proceeds of such collateral, and the lenders under the Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the holders of the MCC 2026 Notes and the holders of the Secured 84 ----- Notes will be entitled to be repaid in full from the proceeds of the Fixed Asset Collateral and the Current Asset Collateral before any payment is made to the holders of any other subordinated indebtedness from the proceeds of such collateral, including the holders of the Unsecured Notes. Moreover, the lenders under the Cash Flow Credit Agreement and the holders of the MCC 2026 Notes will share the proceeds of the Fixed Asset Collateral and the Current Asset Collateral ratably with the holders of the Secured Notes, thereby diluting the collateral coverage. In addition, the terms of the indenture that will govern the Secured Notes will permit, subject to certain limitations, the incurrence of additional debt that may be secured on a pari passu priority basis with, or a junior basis to, the Secured Notes with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The fair market value of the Collateral securing the Secured Notes is subject to fluctuations based on factors that include, among others, the condition of our industry, the ability to sell the Collateral in an orderly sale, general economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. The amount to be received upon a sale of the Collateral would be dependent on numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the actual fair market value of the Collateral at such time and the timing and the manner of the sale. By its nature, portions of the Collateral may be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Collateral can be sold in a short period of time or in an orderly manner. In the event of a foreclosure, liquidation, reorganization, bankruptcy or other insolvency proceeding, we cannot assure you that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral will be sufficient to pay our obligations under the Secured Notes. In addition, in the event of any such proceeding, the ability of the holders of the Secured Notes to realize upon any of the Collateral may be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations. In addition, the security interests of the Note Collateral Agent are subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests in Collateral. For example, the Note Collateral Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party to obtain or enforce a security interest in a contract. We cannot assure you that the Note Collateral Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Also, certain items included in the Collateral, such as licenses and other permits, may not be transferable (by their terms or pursuant to applicable law) and therefore the Note Collateral Agent may not be able to realize value from such items in the event of a foreclosure. The Fixed Asset Collateral and the Current Asset Collateral are subject to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections as may be accepted by the collateral agent for the Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the collateral agent for the ABL Credit Agreement or other representatives of the respective obligations under the Cash Flow Credit Agreement or the ABL Credit Agreement from time to time.

Additionally, part of the security may consist of a pledge of up to 65% of the capital stock of any of our foreign subsidiaries. Although such pledge of capital stock will be required to be granted under U.S. security documents, it may be necessary or desirable to perfect such pledges under foreign law pledge documents. We will not be required to provide such foreign law pledge documents. Unless and until such pledges of capital stock are properly perfected, they may not constitute collateral.

There can be no assurance that all actions necessary to create properly perfected security interests in the Collateral will be taken, which may result in the loss of the priority of the security interest in favor of the holders of the Secured Notes to which they would otherwise have been entitled, including making the security interest in the Fixed Asset Collateral junior to the security interest securing the obligations under the Senior ABL Facility. In addition, the security interests granted in favor of the Note Collateral Agent to secure the Secured Notes are not in all cases required to be created or perfected by the issue date. See “—Security over certain collateral may not be in place or perfected on the date of the sale of the Secured Notes.” If we, or any Guarantor, were to become subject to a bankruptcy proceeding, any liens recorded or perfected after the issue date would face a greater risk of being invalidated than if they had been recorded or perfected on the issue date. Liens recorded or perfected after the issue date (and not within a 30-day safe harbor) may be treated under the Bankruptcy Code as if they were delivered to secure previously existing indebtedness. In bankruptcy proceedings commenced within 90 days (or one year, for certain statutory “insiders”) of lien perfection, a lien given to secure previously existing indebtedness is materially more likely to be avoided as a preference by the bankruptcy court than if delivered and promptly recorded on the issue date (or within 30 days thereof). Accordingly, if we or any Guarantor were to file for bankruptcy protection after the issue date and the liens had been perfected less than 90 days (or one year, for insiders) before commencement of such bankruptcy proceeding, the liens securing the Secured Notes may be particularly subject to challenge as a result of having been delivered after the issue date. To the extent that such challenge succeeded, the holders of the Secured Notes would lose the benefit of the security that the Collateral was intended to provide and could be required to return amounts previously paid to them. In addition, applicable law provides that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, including, among other examples, real property, equipment subject to a certificate of title and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. We and the Guarantors have limited obligations to perfect the security interest of the holders of the Secured Notes in specified collateral. The Note Collateral Agent does not have an obligation to monitor, and there can be no assurance that we will inform the Note Collateral Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that we will take (or cause to be taken) the necessary action to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral. Neither the trustee, the Note Collateral Agent, the collateral agent for the Cash Flow Credit Agreement, 86 ----- the collateral agent for the ABL Credit Agreement nor the collateral agent for the MCC 2026 Notes will have an obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or the creation, perfection, priority, sufficiency or protection of any security interest. Our failure to cause the creation and perfection of certain property may result in the loss of the security interest in the Collateral or the priority of the security interest in favor of the holders of the Secured Notes against third parties, including making the security interest in the Fixed Asset Collateral junior to the security interest securing the obligations under the Senior ABL Facility. Additionally, a failure, for any reason that is not permitted or contemplated under the security documents relating to the Collateral, to perfect the security interests in the properties and assets included in the Collateral securing the Secured Notes may result in a default under the indenture that will govern the Secured Notes and the other agreements governing the Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Such lenders and such representatives may foreclose on or take other actions with respect to the Collateral with which holders of the Secured Notes may disagree or that may be contrary to the interests of holders of the Notes. The Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement (as defined in “Description of Secured Notes – Description of the Intercreditor Agreements”) also provides that, as among the Cash Flow Credit Agreement, MCC 2026 Notes and the Secured Notes, while our Senior Cash Flow Credit Facilities are outstanding, the collateral agent with respect thereto will control all decisions related to enforcement of remedies with respect to the Collateral securing the Secured Notes at all times, unless, at such time, (i) our obligations under our Senior Cash Flow Credit Facilities (or any refinancing indebtedness in respect thereof) are no longer secured pursuant to the terms of the documents governing the our Senior Cash Flow Credit Facilities or (ii) 180 days have elapsed after the occurrence of an event of default under any agreement governing obligations secured by the Fixed Asset Collateral on a first priority basis that constitutes the largest series of all obligations subject to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and that is continuing and acceleration of such series of obligations, so long as the collateral agent for the Cash Flow Credit Agreement has not commenced the exercise of remedies with respect to Collateral, is not stayed from pursuing any such exercise pursuant to the Base Intercreditor Agreement and neither the Issuer nor any of the Guarantors is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. Following such time, the authorized representative for the largest then-outstanding series of first lien priority obligations party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement would control all decisions related to enforcement of remedies with respect to the collateral securing the Secured Notes at all times and holders of the Secured Notes would only be permitted to take enforcement action with respect to such collateral if the Secured Notes are the largest then-outstanding series of first lien priority obligations party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. After the discharge of the obligations with respect to our Cash Flow Credit Agreement, at which time the parties to our Cash Flow Credit Agreement will no longer have the right to direct the actions with respect to the Collateral securing the Secured Notes pursuant to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, that right passes to the authorized representative of holders of the next largest outstanding principal amount of indebtedness secured by a senior priority lien on the Collateral. If we issue 87 ----- additional indebtedness that is equal in priority to the lien securing the Secured Notes in the future in a greater principal amount than the Secured Notes, then the authorized representative for such additional indebtedness would be next in line to exercise rights under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, rather than the Note Collateral Agent.

To the extent the Current Asset Collateral is released from securing the obligations secured by the Current Asset Collateral on a first-priority basis, including all obligations under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility, the Base Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in certain circumstances (including in connection with the exercise of remedies by the agent under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility or in connection with a sale or other disposition of the Current Asset Collateral permitted under the terms of both the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the Secured Notes Indenture), the second-priority liens securing the Secured Notes in the Current Asset Collateral will automatically also be released. In addition, the Secured Notes Indenture and the security documents related to the holders of Secured Notes’ secondpriority lien on the Current Asset Collateral may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the Base Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the ABL Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent party to the Base Intercreditor Agreement that has a permitted first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral until such first-priority lien obligations are paid in full, and the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility and the security documents related to the first-priority lien on the Current Asset Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility may not be amended in any manner that contravenes the terms of the Intercreditor Agreements without the 88 ----- consent of the ABL Collateral Agent. The Base Intercreditor Agreement further provides that, under certain circumstances, the holders of the Secured Notes would be required to turn over to the holders of obligations under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility amounts they receive from the Issuer with respect to the Current Asset Collateral.

Under the Bankruptcy Code, upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case, an automatic stay goes into effect which, among other things, stays: - the commencement or continuation of any action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the bankruptcy case to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case; - any act to obtain possession of, or control over, property of the bankruptcy estate or the debtor; - any act to create, perfect or enforce any lien against property of the bankruptcy estate; and - any act to collect or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the bankruptcy case. For example, under the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to the automatic stay imposed upon the bankruptcy filing, a secured creditor is prohibited from repossessing its security from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from disposing of security repossessed from such debtor, or taking other actions to levy against a debtor, without bankruptcy court approval, which may not be given or could be materially delayed. Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use and sell collateral even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, provided that the secured creditor is given “adequate protection” with respect to the secured portion of its claim against the debtor. The meaning of the term “adequate protection” may vary according to circumstances (and is within the discretion of the bankruptcy court), but it is intended in general to protect the secured creditor against diminution in the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral as a result of 90 ----- the automatic stay or disposition or any use or sale of the collateral by the debtor during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. Adequate protection may take the form of cash payments or the granting of additional or replacement security, if and at such times as the court in its discretion determines. Generally, adequate protection payments, in the form of interest or otherwise, are not required to be paid by a debtor to a secured creditor unless the bankruptcy court determines that the value of the secured creditor’s interest in the collateral is declining during the pendency of the bankruptcy case. Due to the imposition of the automatic stay, the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection” and the broad discretionary powers of a bankruptcy court, and even if the Secured Notes were fully collateralized, it is impossible to predict (a) how long payments under the Secured Notes could be delayed following commencement of a bankruptcy case, (b) whether or when the Note Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the pledged assets, if ever, and (c) whether or to what extent holders of the Secured Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the pledged assets through the requirements of “adequate protection,” or what form any such adequate protection would take.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

There are, however, some losses that may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable, or insured for values less than the then current fair market value of relevant equipment, in whole or in part. As a result, insurance proceeds may not compensate us fully for our losses. If there is a total or partial loss of any of the pledged assets, the proceeds received by us in respect thereof may not be sufficient to satisfy all the secured obligations, including the Secured Notes. Moreover, the Note Collateral Agent may need to evaluate the impact of potential liabilities before determining to foreclose on collateral consisting of real property because owners and operators of real property may be held liable under environmental laws for the costs of investigating or remediating contamination or preventing the release or threatened release of hazardous substances at such real property.

We believe we have approximately 15% market share of a highly fragmented estimated $16 billion addressable market for prime labels across North America and Europe as of 2019, with approximately two times the scale of the next largest prime label manufacturer and approximately seven times the scale of the third and fourth largest prime label manufacturers, respectively, based on net sales for 2019.

This aspiration drives us and is reflected in the customer and market focus, teamwork, process excellence and trusted relationships that define our culture. We believe our scale and global footprint, comprehensive product and service offering, welldiversified exposures, long-standing customer relationships and dedicated employees, significant expected cost savings opportunities, meaningful investments in innovation and sustainability solutions, and extensive acquisition track record create competitive advantages relative to other prime label manufacturers. We believe MCC and Fort Dearborn are highly complementary businesses and that the combination is strategically and financially compelling, resulting in a stronger market leader in a highly fragmented industry in which scale provides advantages. The combination will expand the breadth and depth of our comprehensive product portfolio and customer base, across which there is limited overlap, and will improve our diversification across label technologies, end categories and geographies. Our comprehensive portfolio of label technologies, including Pressure Sensitive, Cut & Stack, Roll-Fed, In-Mold, Shrink Sleeve and Heat Transfer, serves approximately 16,000 aggregate customers across a broad range of end categories, including Food & Beverage, Wine & Spirits, Home & Personal Care and Healthcare, Industrial & Other Specialty.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Reporting units are defined as either 121 ----- operating segments or one level below the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the business management. When performing our interim and annual impairment assessments, we estimate the fair value of reporting units using a combination of: (i) a market approach based on multiples of net revenues and earnings before interest depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from recent comparable transactions and other market data; and (ii) an income approach based on expected future cash flows discounted at rates ranging between 9.00% to 12.75%. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include estimates of future projected business results (principally net revenues and EBITDA), long-term growth rates, and the discount rate. The discount rate reflects the risk associated with each respective reporting unit, including the industry and geographies in which they operate. The discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to achieve our most recent forecasts, and other factors not known at this time. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and discount rate. Management judgement is involved in estimating these variables, and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. We perform sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and discount rate estimates. These assumptions are typically not considered individually because assumptions used to select one variable should also be considered when selecting other variables; however, sensitivity of the overall fair value assessment to each significant variable is also considered.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss and credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated balance sheet. The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by us in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. In determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we give consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities and recent trends in financial results. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we generally consider three years of cumulative income or loss at the jurisdictional taxpayer level as an important factor. 122 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Cost of goods sold is generally driven by the cost of these items and the volume and mix of the products manufactured. Gross profit._ Gross profit primarily represents the difference between the product cost, including labor and indirect costs associated with the manufacturing process, and the sale price to our customers. Selling, general and administrative._ These expenses include salaries and commissions for corporate and sales personnel, marketing expenses, professional fees, legal and consulting fees, bad debt expense and other corporate administrative costs not allocated to cost of products sold. Selling, general, and administrative expenses are primarily driven by wage increases, the occurrence and timing of consulting projects, and other legal and professional fees, offset by headcount reductions. Facility closure._ Facility closure expenses primarily include severance, contract termination and other associated costs (including, but not limited to costs to consolidate or close facilities and relocate employees). Transaction, integration and restructuring._ Transaction, integration and restructuring costs primarily include direct costs related to acquisition of businesses, integration of acquisitions into our existing operations and restructuring of operations. These costs include legal, accounting, valuation, engineering, finders’ fees, severance, contract termination costs and other associated costs. Amortization expense and impairment loss on intangible assets._ We record amortization of identifiable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the contractual or estimated useful life of each intangible asset. Identifiable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable. When the carrying value of an asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. 125 ----- Interest expense._ Interest expense includes interest accruing on our indebtedness, including capital leases. Interest expense is affected by changes in average outstanding indebtedness and variable interest rates. Other expense (income)._ Other income includes proceeds from the sale of scrap and rental income collected on properties sub-leased subsequent to operational restructurings. Other income also includes the gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transaction adjustments. Other income is primarily driven by scrap values. Loss on extinguishment of debt._ Loss on extinguishment of debt primarily represents losses incurred to extinguish certain debt and related debt issuance costs, including senior notes and bonds. Income tax expense._ Income taxes include current taxes payable or refundable, plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Reporting units are defined as either operating segments or one level below the operating segments for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the business management. When performing our interim and annual impairment assessments, we estimate the fair value of reporting units using a combination of: (i) a market approach based on multiples of net revenues and earnings before interest depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from recent comparable transactions and other market data; and (ii) an income approach based on expected future cash flows discounted at rates ranging between 9.00% to 12.75%. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies include estimates of future projected business results (principally net revenues and EBITDA), long-term growth rates, and the discount rate. The discount rate reflects the risk associated with each respective reporting unit, including the industry and geographies in which they operate. The discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to achieve our most recent forecasts, and other factors not known at this time. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions, including projected business results, long-term growth factors and discount rate. Management judgement is involved in estimating these variables, and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events. We perform sensitivity analyses by using a range of inputs to confirm the reasonableness of the long-term growth rate and discount rate estimates. These assumptions are typically not considered individually because assumptions used to select one variable should also be considered when selecting other variables; however, sensitivity of the overall fair value assessment to each significant variable is also considered.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid, currently payable or receivable, and deferred taxes. Under GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss and credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date occurs. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of 133 ----- subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from our estimates and assumptions due to changes or future events such as tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, the resulting change to the provision for income taxes could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated balance sheet. The recoverability of deferred tax assets and the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions are subject to various assumptions and judgment. If actual results differ from the estimates made by us in establishing or maintaining valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the resulting change in the valuation allowance would generally impact earnings. Additionally, the positions taken with regard to tax contingencies may be subject to audit and review by tax authorities, which may result in future taxes, interest and penalties. Positive and negative evidence is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, which includes such evidence as historical earnings, projected future earnings, tax planning strategies and expected timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. In determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets, we give consideration to all available positive and negative evidence including reversals of deferred tax liabilities and recent trends in financial results. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we generally consider three years of cumulative income or loss at the jurisdictional taxpayer level as an important factor.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The potential effect of negative demand on net revenues is also uncertain given the volatile environment, but demand and production levels are anticipated to recover. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in the impairment testing for goodwill, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. While we can implement and have implemented certain strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans, forecasts, or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate each of our reporting unit fair values and could result in a further decline in fair value that would trigger a future material non-cash impairment charge of the reporting units’ goodwill balance in future periods.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

During 2020, we experienced increased demand resulting in higher sales associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The increased sales were mostly offset by higher outsourcing costs, material and labor shortages and other various plant costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our liquidity was not materially impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of COVID-19, both the public and private sectors in the United States and in other affected regions have introduced certain policies and initiatives in an effort to reduce the transmission 135 ----- of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions; mandates from federal, state and local authorities to close non-essential businesses and avoid large gatherings of people; quarantine or “shelter-in-place;” and the promotion of social distancing and the adoption of work-from-home and online learning by companies and institutions. For the six months ended June 30, 2021, Fort Dearborn experienced moderate negative financial impact due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as our customers were impacted by various factors related to the pandemic such as “shelter-in-place,” “stay-at-home” orders and travel restrictions. Fort Dearborn’s plants have generally remained operational, although some slowdowns associated with raw materials and labor market shortages and outsourcing of certain activities created additional costs and inefficiencies for Fort Dearborn.

Our long-term needs primarily include meeting debt service requirements, working capital requirements and capital expenditures. We may also pursue strategic acquisition opportunities that may impact our future cash requirements. There are a number of factors that may negatively impact our available sources of funds in the future including the ability to generate cash from operations and borrow on our debt facilities. The amount of cash generated from operations is dependent upon factors such as the successful execution of our business strategies and general economic conditions. The amount of cash available for borrowings under our various debt facilities is dependent on our ability to maintain sufficient collateral and general financial conditions in the marketplace. Our cash requirements within the next twelve months primarily include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash from operations, our revolving line of credit and access to capital through our shareholders. 142 ----- Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include: - Debt Obligations and Interest Payments—See Note 8, “Revolving Line of Credit and LongTerm Debt,” in Fort Dearborn’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 for further detail of our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments; - Operating and Capital leases—See Note 9, “Leases,” in Fort Dearborn’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments; - Employee Benefit Plans—See Note 12, “Benefit Plans,” in Fort Dearborn’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments under the US Benefit Plans and Canadian Benefit Plans; and - Interest Rate Swap—See Note 1 (m), “Derivatives,” in Fort Dearborn’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020 for further detail of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments. We believe the following sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes: - our cash flows from operations; - the availability of additional capital under our existing revolving line of credit; - our ability to access additional capital through the issuance of new term debt under our first lien term loan credit facility; and - our ability to access capital privately through our shareholders and other institutional investors.

Our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing products customized for the customer. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a five-step model consisting of the following: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) Fort Dearborn satisfies a performance obligation. Fort Dearborn recognizes revenue for its products when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from our manufacturing facility to our customer. Certain customers may receive volumebased incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized. Certain customers receive a portion of their products as consigned inventories with revenue recognized once the customer uses or consumes the products. Some contracts with customers contain enforceable right of payment terms that include a reasonable profit throughout the duration of the contract for products that do not have an alternative use, which trigger recognition of revenue over time. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration to which Fort Dearborn expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services upon completion of manufacturing, including the expected value of variable consideration, based on the completion percentage of products as of the year end. For consignment and vendor managed 145 ----- inventory arrangements that have enforceable rights to payment and involve products with no alternative use, revenue is recognized over time. All other revenues are considered point in time, with revenue being recognized at a point in time, based on shipments to customers. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight, after control over a product has transferred to a customer, are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of goods sold as incurred. Taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by Fort Dearborn from a customer, are excluded from sales.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Raw materials inventories consist of commodity and specialized products purchased in quantity for conversion and sale to customers. Raw materials inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined by the first-in, first-out method (“FIFO”)) or net realizable value (“NRV”). Work-in-process and finished goods inventories are priced at the cost of raw materials and supplies used, direct labor, and an overhead burden rate related to indirect production costs incidental to and necessary for the production of the item, with values presented at lower of cost or NRV. Inventories are valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process, and finished goods. Allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels to historical usage rates and estimated future sales and by analyzing the age of inventory to identify specific items that are judged as unlikely to be sold.

Goodwill is recorded at its initial value, net of accumulated amortization. 146 ----- Fort Dearborn tests for goodwill impairment at the entity level when an event or circumstance occurs that indicates the fair value may be below carrying value. The amount of impairment recorded, if necessary, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Annually we assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values exceed the carrying values of these assets. Also, we review for impairment when events or circumstances occur that indicate the fair value may be below carrying value. Our testing may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment; however, if a qualitative assessment is performed and we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit, is more likely than not, to be less than its carrying amount, a quantitative test is performed.

The ASU was effective upon issuance on March 12, 2020. Fort Dearborn applied certain of the practical expedients as of March 12, 2020 to continue its hedging relationships that reference forecasted transactions based on LIBOR. Optional expedients in Topic 848 are generally available until December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not have a material effect on Fort Dearborn’s consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and early adoption is permitted. Fort Dearborn plans to adopt the standard in its fiscal year ending December 25, 2022. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. Fort Dearborn is currently assessing the impact that adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.

We believe we have approximately 15% market share of a highly fragmented estimated $16 billion addressable market for prime labels across North America and Europe as of 2019, with approximately two times the scale of the next largest prime label manufacturer and approximately seven times the scale of the third and fourth largest prime label manufacturers, respectively, based on net revenues for 2019. We believe our scale and global footprint, comprehensive product and service offering, well-diversified exposures, long-standing customer relationships and dedicated employees, significant expected cost savings opportunities, meaningful investments in innovation and sustainability solutions, and extensive acquisition track record create competitive advantages relative to other prime label manufacturers. We believe Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn are highly complementary businesses and that the combination is strategically and financially compelling, resulting in a stronger market leader in a highly fragmented industry in which scale provides advantages. The combination will expand the breadth and depth of our comprehensive product portfolio and customer base, across which there is limited overlap, and will improve our diversification across label technologies, end categories, and geographies. We believe the combination will also allow us to realize an estimated $150 million in run-rate cost synergies, further improving our financial profile. The cost synergies are expected to be driven primarily by procurement savings, efficiencies in selling, general, and administrative expense, manufacturing footprint consolidation, and operational improvements including material waste reduction and in-sourcing, among others. In addition to the identified cost synergies, we believe there are several other meaningful operational improvement opportunities, as reflected by approximately $84 million of “in-flight” cost savings initiatives identified by management across the combined business, expected to be driven by cost synergy realization from previously completed acquisitions, continuous improvement and lean manufacturing, procurement, capital productivity, and other identified initiatives. For a further discussion of estimated synergies, see “Offering Circular Summary—Summary Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.” Our comprehensive portfolio of label technologies, including PSL, C&S, RF, IML, SS and HT, serves approximately 16,000 aggregate customers on a gross basis across a broad range of end categories, including F&B, W&S, HPC and Specialty. Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn are highly complementary in terms of label technology and end category exposures, as Multi-Color is stronger in PSL with well-established positions in HPC and W&S, and Fort Dearborn is stronger in C&S with attractive positions in faster-growth F&B categories, such as condiments and sauces. We believe we hold number one or two positions across North America and Europe in each of these label technologies and end categories. Our leadership in digital printing and prototyping, product innovation and sustainability solutions, and value-added services underpin our differentiated value proposition, which is further strengthened by our world-class supply chain and effective commercial strategy. We 149 ----- believe our customers highly value our certainty of supply and broad suite of value-added services, which includes advanced material science capabilities, artwork support and graphics management, on-site customer support, and inventory management. The company maintains a diverse set of exposures across label technologies, and our prime labels are used in a broad range of consumerfacing end categories globally that have historically demonstrated resiliency and stable growth across a range of macroeconomic environments. We estimate that on a combined basis, F&B, HPC, W&S, and Specialty end categories comprised approximately 54%, 18%, 17%, and 10%, respectively, of combined net revenues based on the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2020. We operate an industry-leading global footprint of 95 facilities across 28 countries and on a combined basis have invested over $300 million on capital expenditures since 2018, which we believe provides meaningful capacity to support future growth. We believe we have a best-in-class fleet of label converting equipment, including flexographic, lithographic, rotogravure, and digital printing technologies, which enables us to optimize workflow, allocate jobs to the most efficient presses, and fill customer orders across our combined network, while serving customer needs across all run lengths, manufacturing finishes, and designs.

518,Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.21,Strategic Rationale of Our Combination,212.21.1,,"We believe Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn are highly complementary businesses and the combination is strategically and financially compelling and will enhance Multi-Color’s position as the leading manufacturer of prime labels globally. Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn are two of the largest manufacturers of prime labels globally in a highly fragmented estimated $16 billion addressable market across North America and Europe as of 2019. We believe the combined company has approximately 15% market share across North America and Europe, with approximately two times the scale of the next largest prime label manufacturer and approximately seven times the scale of the third and fourth largest prime label manufacturers, respectively, based on net revenues for 2019. The combination will expand the breadth and depth of our comprehensive product portfolio and customer base, across which there is limited overlap, and will improve our diversification across label technologies, end categories, and geographies. We believe the combined company will benefit from the advantages to scale in prime label manufacturing, across sourcing, operations, and organic growth and share gain, as evidenced by the long track-record of leading global prime label manufacturers outperforming the broader industry. We believe our scale and global footprint, comprehensive product and service offering, well-diversified exposures, long-standing 157 ----- customer relationships and dedicated employees, significant expected cost savings opportunities, meaningful investments in innovation and sustainability solutions, and extensive acquisition track record create competitive advantages relative to other prime label manufacturers. We intend to apply best practices and leverage our enhanced scale across Multi-Color and Fort Dearborn to drive additional growth and share gain, strengthen operational performance and profitability, and improve capital efficiency. We estimate that the combination will unlock approximately $150 million of run-rate cost synergies. The cost synergies are expected to be driven primarily by procurement savings, efficiencies in selling, general, and administrative expense, manufacturing footprint consolidation, and operational improvements including material waste reduction and in-sourcing, among others. In addition to the identified cost synergies, we believe there are several other meaningful operational improvement opportunities, as reflected by approximately $84 million of “in-flight” cost savings initiatives identified by management across the combined business, expected to be driven by cost synergy realization from previously completed acquisitions, continuous improvement and lean manufacturing, procurement, capital productivity, and other identified initiatives.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539
518,Offerings 2021.md,212,BUSINESS,212.22,Industry Overview,212.22.1,,"The global label industry was estimated to be approximately $41 billion in 2019 and volume is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 5% from 2019 to 2024 according to Smithers Pira. Within the broader label industry, we participate in the prime label product category, which consists of labels that are used specifically to identify products on a store shelf or in a retail environment and play a key role in “front-of-line” branding and shelf appeal. Based on findings from a third-party consulting firm and industry research, we estimate a global addressable market for prime labels of approximately $31 billion in 2019, and across North America and Europe, we estimate an addressable market of approximately $16 billion in 2019. We believe prime labels are one of the most important and recognizable components of product identity and are key drivers of consumer preference and loyalty across a wide spectrum of consumerfacing end categories and applications. Prime labels are also used to convey consumer-related information, to provide a means of ensuring product integrity and security, and also to meet regulatory requirements. Prime labels comprise a very small percentage of overall customer product cost, estimated at approximately 1-3% for CPG products. Low cost-to-value, high manufacturing and service complexity, and criticality of supply, coupled with significant portions of revenue under contract, result in enduring customer relationships among leading global prime label manufacturers. Prime label manufacturers benefit from multiple dynamics that have a positive impact on pricing and mix. We believe trends toward increased premiumization, SKU redesign velocity and proliferation, and lead-time and order size variability will continue to manifest in average prime label unit price growth. These positive trends are driven in large part by customers’ marketing departments, which continue to demand more premium labeling solutions, including foils, embossing, and etching, and consistently redesign SKUs, typically 2-3 times per year for seasonal and promotional items, enabling prime label suppliers to drive pricing improvement over the life of a contract. The growth in label redesigns is driven by increased market demand for customization, brand premiumization, sustainable packaging, and interactive packaging. Each redesign of a label is an opportunity to add value-added embellishments or special finishes to the label at an enhanced margin. Additionally, the fragmentation of large CPGs, which has resulted in smaller brands and shifting consumer preferences, has driven SKU proliferation, increasing the complexity and number of SKUs that prime label manufacturers help brands manage, which supports value-based pricing. Furthermore, SKU proliferation and increasingly complex global supply chains have made it exceedingly challenging for customers to forecast demand at the SKU level, which provides prime label manufacturers the opportunity to charge additional fees 158 ----- when order sizes and lead-times differ from those initially agreed upon. In addition to positive like-for-like pricing trends, a significant portion of prime label supply agreements allow for the contractual pass-through of raw material price inflation, which we believe has resulted in long-term margin stability across periods of inflation and deflation. Demand for prime labels is primarily driven by recession-resilient, defensive end categories, most of which are consumer-facing, including F&B, HPC, W&S and Specialty. As a result, demand for prime labels has largely been insulated from the impact of economic downturns as evidenced by stable prime label demand growth across North America and Europe during the Great Financial Crisis, and strong growth in 2020 throughout the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the most relevant indicator of underlying prime label demand is CPG unit volume, which has demonstrated long-term stability in demand relative to underlying GDP across a range of macroeconomic environments and downturns.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

We foresee no material future shifts in label converting technology, and we believe digital printing will benefit scaled prime label manufacturers by lowering the cost to serve small customers, unlocking opportunities for improved growth and profitability. Despite moderate volume headwinds faced by prime label manufacturers historically due to shifts in certain underlying packaging materials upon which prime labels are applied, namely the substitution of glass bottles to metal cans for beer and metal cans and rigid plastic to paper-based containers for liquids, we believe the most significant headwinds are lessening, or reversing. Furthermore, we believe the dynamics that drive favorable pricing and mix trends will continue, including premiumization, SKU redesign velocity and proliferation, and manufacturing and service complexity, and we foresee no meaningful dilution in the value proposition of prime labels as a result of increasing e-commerce penetration. Importantly, we believe the main trends observed among our customers in transitioning to more sustainable offerings are in aggregate neutral to positive for prime label suppliers and that leading global prime label suppliers are well-positioned to be net beneficiaries as a result of being able to invest in differentiated sustainability capabilities and better serve their customers’ evolving needs. Prime labels represent a very small component of overall packaging material usage and, as a result, have been an ancillary focus among our customers and end consumers. However, prime label manufacturers play a key role in enabling packaging recyclability by delivering labels with high ease of removal during the recycling process. Sustainable prime label offerings, including lighter-weight and biodegradable products, are expected to continue to benefit from secular demand growth and provide opportunities for value-based pricing and margin improvement. Most recycling trends that have resulted in volume headwinds for rigid packaging companies have had a neutral impact on prime label volume demand and afford opportunities to realize value-based pricing. Substrate substitution in favor of paper-based packaging (e.g., Tetra Pack), which typically does not use a prime label, has resulted in marginal volume headwinds, but there is evidence of this substitution trend reversing. Reduced single-use plastics consumption is expected to continue to result in lower prime label demand; however, the combined company is relatively insulated from this headwind as it has lower exposure to 160 ----- single-use plastics than the overall prime label industry and has minimal exposure to clear water, the most impacted product category. Overall, we believe that the accelerating trend toward more sustainable offerings represents limited risk to prime label volume demand, while introducing multiple opportunities for leading prime label suppliers to provide innovative higher-priced products with accretive financial contribution. The global prime labels industry remains highly fragmented, with single plant manufacturers operating in a local market, or multi-plant manufacturers operating in certain regions, constituting the majority of industry capacity, with relatively few global manufacturers. We believe that this highly fragmented market will continue to experience consolidation as suppliers attempt to realize the benefits to scale in prime label manufacturing, across sourcing, operations, and organic growth and share gain, and as global customers continue to consolidate their prime label spend volume across leading global suppliers. We believe these factors have resulted in leading global prime label manufacturers historically taking share vis-à-vis smaller and mid-sized competitors, resulting in long-term abovemarket growth, a trend that we believe will continue to benefit leading global prime label manufacturers. Overall, we believe the global prime label manufacturing industry is highly attractive and that our combined company is well-positioned as the global leader.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event and to the extent that customary field examinations and appraisals relating to the receivables and inventory constituting a part of the borrowing base have not been completed by the closing date of the acquisition of MCC (the “MCC Acquisition”), the amount available under the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility shall be deemed to be $365.0 million until the earlier of (a) such time as such customary field examinations and appraisals have been completed and (b) the 120[th] day following the closing date of the MCC Acquisition.

As long as Escrowed Property is deposited with the Escrow Agent, such Escrowed Property will be required to be invested by the Escrow Agent at the Company’s written instruction in cash or Eligible Escrow Investments. “Eligible Escrow Investments” means any of the following: (1) any investment in obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof, in each case, maturing no later than the Outside Date, (2) overnight bank deposits, and investments in time deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bankers’ acceptances and money market deposits (or, with respect to foreign banks, similar instruments), maturing no later than the Outside Date, (x) entitled to U.S. federal deposit insurance for the full amount thereof or (y) issued by a bank or trust company (including the Escrow Agent or an affiliate of the Escrow Agent) that is organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof having capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in excess of $250.0 million, (3) repurchase obligations, maturing no later than the Outside Date, for underlying securities or instruments of the types described in clause (1) or (2) above entered into with a bank meeting the qualifications described in clause (2) above, (4) Investments in commercial paper, maturing no later than the Outside Date, issued by a Person (other than that of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), with a rating at the time as of which any Investment therein is made of “P-2” (or higher) according to Moody’s or “A-2” (or higher) according to S&P (or, in either case, the equivalent of 190 ----- such rating by such organization or, if no rating of S&P or Moody’s then exists, the equivalent of such rating by any nationally recognized rating organization) and (5) money market mutual funds that invest at least 90.0% of their assets in Eligible Escrow Investments described in any of the preceding clauses (1) through (4) (which funds may also hold cash pending investment and/or distribution) and are subject to the risk limiting conditions of Rule 2a-7 (or any successor rule) of the SEC under the Investment Company Act, as amended, and that at the time of such investment are rated “Aaa” by Moody’s or “AAA” by S&P (or, in either case, the equivalent of such rating by such organization or, if no rating of S&P or Moody’s then exists, the equivalent of such rating by any nationally recognized rating organization), including such funds for which the Trustee or an affiliate provides investment advice or other services. If the Escrow Agent receives a Special Redemption Notice and is directed by the Company to liquidate the Escrowed Property, the Escrow Agent will liquidate all Escrowed Property then held by it not later than the last Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date. On the Business Day prior to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Trustee for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price as directed by the Company in writing for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver the excess Escrowed Property (if any) after payment of any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and Trustee to the Company. If the Escrow Agent receives a Proceeds Reduction Redemption Notice and is directed by the Company to liquidate the Escrowed Property subject to the Proceeds Reduction Redemption, the Escrow Agent will liquidate the Escrowed Property then held by it not later than the last Business Day prior to the Escrow Release Date. On the Business Day prior to the Escrow Release Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Trustee for payment to each applicable Holder the Release Proceeds Reduction Redemption Price as directed by the Company in writing for such Holder’s Notes and, concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver the excess Escrowed Property (if any) after payment of any fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and Trustee to the Company. We currently expect both the Fortune Acquisition and the Monarch Acquisition to occur substantially concurrently with the closing of this offering. If, however, the closing of this offering occurs on a date prior to the date of consummation of the Fortune Acquisition, concurrently with the closing of this offering, the Company will enter into an escrow agreement (the “Escrow Agreement”) with the Trustee and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”). Pursuant to such Escrow Agreement, the Company will (i) deposit, or direct the deposit of, an amount (in cash and/or Eligible Escrow Investments (as defined below)) equal to the gross proceeds of the offering of the Notes sold on the Issue Date and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, an additional amount (in cash and/or Eligible Escrow Investments) sufficient (as determined solely by the Company) to pay interest with respect to the Notes up to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) based on the Outside Date (as defined below) (the cash and/or Eligible Escrow Investments deposited in accordance with the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, with any investments thereof and all interest, dividends and other distributions and payments thereon received by the Escrow Agent, the “Escrowed Property”), into an escrow account with the Escrow Agent (the “Escrow _Account”). The Company will grant the Trustee, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders of the_ Notes, a first priority security interest in the Escrow Account and the Escrowed Property to secure the Obligations under the Notes pending disbursement as described below. The Company will only be entitled to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent will release the Escrowed Property (the “Release”) to, or at the order of, the Company (the date of such release being referred to as the “Escrow Release Date”) upon delivery by the Company to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee of an Officer’s Certificate addressed to the Escrow Agent and the Trustee on or prior to July 1, 2022 (or such later date as agreed to by the parties to the Fortune Acquisition Agreement as the “Termination Date” as defined therein) (such then applicable date, the “Outside Date”), certifying that the following conditions will be met promptly following the Release on the Escrow Release Date: (i) the conditions precedent to the funding of the term loans under the Senior Credit Facilities (including the condition in respect of the consummation of the Fortune Acquisition) shall have been, or substantially concurrently shall be, satisfied or waived in all material respects; and (ii) the Fortune Acquisition will be consummated, promptly upon release of the Escrowed Property. In the event that (a) the Escrow Agent shall not have received an Officer’s Certificate described above on or prior to the Outside Date or (b) the Company shall notify the Escrow Agent in writing that the Company has determined that the Escrow Release Date will not occur on or prior to the Outside Date (each such event being a “Mandatory Redemption Event”), the Company will redeem all of the Notes (the “Special Mandatory Redemption”) at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, to but not including the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below)(the “Special Mandatory Redemption Price”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Special Mandatory Redemption of the Notes shall be without premium or penalty and net of any original issue discount and/or upfront fees in respect of the Notes that were payable on the Issue Date. Notice of the occurrence of a Mandatory Redemption Event will be given by the Company (a “Special _Redemption Notice”) within three Business Days following the occurrence of a Mandatory Redemption_ Event, to the Trustee, the Escrow Agent and DTC. No less than three Business Days after the 310 ----- Company sends such notice of a Mandatory Redemption Event or otherwise in accordance with DTC’s procedures, the Company will perform the Special Mandatory Redemption (the date of such redemption, the “Special Mandatory Redemption Date”). The Escrow Account will not include cash to fund any accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes which is included in the Special Mandatory Redemption Price. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption Price payable upon such Special Mandatory Redemption for the Notes exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Property, the Company will be required to fund the difference between the Special Mandatory Redemption Price and the amount of the Escrowed Property pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. If the Release occurs, and there is any resulting reduction in cash uses in connection with the Fortune Acquisition that would result in reduction to the use of proceeds of the Notes necessary to consummate the Fortune Acquisition, as provided for in the conditions precedent to the initial funding of the proceeds of the Indebtedness incurred under the Senior Cash Flow Facility (the “Proceeds _Reduction Redemption”), the reduction in cash uses may be used by the Company following the_ Release to prepay, redeem or reduce the Notes (which prepayment, redemption or reduction in Notes shall not result in an aggregate principal amount of the Notes less than $200.0 million, unless reduced to $0) (followed by a reduction of only the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Senior Cash Flow Agreement), and any such Notes will be redeemed at a price equal to 100.0% of the initial issue price of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date, or from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for, to but not including the Escrow Release Date (the “Proceeds Reduction Redemption Price”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Proceeds Reduction Redemption of the applicable Notes shall be without premium or penalty and net of any original issue discount and/or upfront fees in respect of such Notes that were payable on the Issue Date.

For example, upon the commencement of a case for relief under the Bankruptcy Code, creditors, such as the Note Collateral Agent, are prohibited by the automatic stay from taking various actions in furtherance of debt collection, including obtaining possession of its collateral from a debtor in a bankruptcy case, or from exercising control over or disposing of collateral taken from such debtor, in each case without prior bankruptcy court approval (which may not be given under the circumstances or could be materially delayed). Moreover, the Bankruptcy Code generally permits the debtor to continue to retain and to use collateral owned as of the date of the bankruptcy filing (and the proceeds, products, offspring, rents or profits of such collateral) even though the debtor is in default under the applicable debt instruments, subject to certain protections afforded to a secured creditor (including the right to receive “adequate protection”). In view of the broad equitable powers of a U.S. bankruptcy court, as well as the lack of a precise definition of the term “adequate protection,” it is impossible to predict whether or when payments under 202 ----- the Notes could be made following the commencement of an insolvency or liquidation proceeding (or the length of any delay in making such payments), whether or when the Note Collateral Agent could repossess or dispose of the Collateral, the value of the Collateral at the time of the bankruptcy petition or any other relevant time or whether or to what extent holders of the Notes would be compensated for any delay in payment or loss of value of the Collateral through adequate protection or otherwise. Furthermore, in the event a bankruptcy court determines that the value of the Collateral (after giving effect to any Priority Lien Obligations, to the extent senior to the obligations in respect of the Notes, or Parity Lien Indebtedness) is not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the Notes, the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes would be “undersecured” and the holders of the Notes would only hold secured claims to the extent of the value of the Collateral and would hold unsecured, “deficiency” claims as to the difference. The Bankruptcy Code permits the payment and/or accrual of Post-Petition Interest to a secured creditor during a debtor’s bankruptcy case only to the extent the value of the Collateral is determined by the bankruptcy court to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the obligations secured by the Collateral on account of which payment or accrual of Post-Petition Interest is sought (as well as any obligations secured by a senior lien on such Collateral). In addition, the Company or any Guarantor (or any trustee appointed therefor) or creditors of the Company or any Guarantor may seek to challenge the grant of the Collateral to the Note Collateral Agent, or the incurrence of obligations in respect of the Notes, as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, preference or otherwise under the Bankruptcy Code and/or applicable state law. If such a challenge were successful, the Liens may be avoided, leaving the holders of the Notes with unsecured claims (or potentially no claims at all) against the applicable entities. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Offering and the Notes—U.S. Federal and state fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer laws may permit a court to avoid the Notes and the guarantees, and the liens securing the Secured Notes and the related guarantees, and, if that occurs, you may not receive any payments on the Notes.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent and will remain the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent until the earlier of (1) the discharge of Parity Lien Obligations that are Senior Cash Flow Obligations and (2) the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date (such earlier date, the “Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date”). After the Controlling Collateral Agent Change Date, the Controlling Collateral Agent will be the authorized representative of the Series of Parity Lien Obligations that constitutes the largest outstanding principal amount of any then outstanding Series of Parity Lien Obligations (excluding the Series of Senior Cash Flow Obligations) with respect to such Collateral, but solely to the extent that such Series of Parity Lien Obligations has a larger aggregate principal amount than the Senior Cash Flow Obligations then outstanding (the “Major Non-Controlling _Collateral Agent”)._ With respect to any Collateral, no Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or other Non-Controlling Secured Party shall or shall instruct the Controlling Collateral Agent to, commence any judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee, receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its security interest in or realize upon, or take any other action available to it in respect of, any Collateral. The “Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date” means, with respect to any Non-Controlling Collateral Agent, the date that is 180 days (throughout which 180-day period such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent was the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent) after the occurrence of both (a) an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for the applicable Series of Parity Lien Obligations, and (b) the Controlling Collateral Agent and each other collateral agent’s receipt of written notice from such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent certifying that (i) such Non-Controlling Collateral Agent is the Major Non-Controlling Collateral Agent and that an event of default, as defined in the indenture or other debt facility for that Series of Parity Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Parity Lien Obligations of that Series are currently due and payable in full (whether as a result of acceleration thereof or otherwise) in accordance with the indenture or debt facility for that Series of Parity Lien Obligations; provided that the Non-Controlling Collateral Agent Enforcement Date will be stayed and will not occur and will be deemed not to have occurred with respect to any Collateral (1) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent has commenced and is diligently pursuing any enforcement action (including delivery by the Controlling Collateral Agent of a notice to the ABL Collateral Agent that purports to commence a Revolving Credit Standstill Period (as such term is defined in the Base Intercreditor Agreement) thereunder) with respect to such Collateral or any portion thereof, (2) at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent is stayed under the Base Intercreditor Agreement from pursuing enforcement actions with respect to such Collateral or any portion thereof or (3) at any time the Company or the Guarantor that has granted a security interest in such Collateral is then a debtor under or with respect to (or otherwise subject to) any insolvency or liquidation proceeding. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, the Controlling Collateral Agent will initially be the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent and the Note Collateral Agent will have no rights to take any action under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral unless and until it becomes the Controlling Collateral Agent or unless expressly permitted by the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. 204 ----- Notwithstanding the equal priority of the Liens on the Collateral, the Controlling Collateral Agent may deal with the Collateral as if the Controlling Collateral Agent had a senior Lien on such Collateral. No Non-Controlling Collateral Agent or Non-Controlling Secured Party will contest, protest or object to any foreclosure proceeding or action brought by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party or any other exercise by the Controlling Collateral Agent or any Controlling Secured Party of any rights and remedies relating to the Collateral. Each of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations also will agree that it will not contest or support any other person in contesting, in any proceeding (including any insolvency or liquidation proceeding), the perfection, priority, validity, attachment or enforceability of a Lien held by or on behalf of any of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations in all or any part of the Collateral, or the provisions of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. If an Event of Default or an event of default under any document governing a Series of Parity Lien Obligations has occurred and is continuing and the Controlling Collateral Agent is taking action to enforce rights in respect of any Collateral, or any distribution is made with respect to any Collateral in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding of the Company or any Guarantor (including any adequate protection payments) or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations receives any payment pursuant to any intercreditor agreement (other than the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement but including the Base Intercreditor Agreement) with respect to any Collateral, the payments, proceeds or distribution of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any such Collateral received by any authorized representative or any holder of Parity Lien Obligations and any such distribution or payment in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding to which the Parity Lien Obligations are entitled under any other intercreditor agreement (subject, in the case of any such payments, proceeds, or distribution, to the paragraph immediately following) shall, subject to the terms of the Base Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, be applied among the Parity Lien Obligations to the payment in full of the Parity Lien Obligations on a ratable basis, after payment of all amounts owing to each authorized representative (in its capacity as the agent for the applicable Parity Lien Obligations); provided that following the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding with respect to the Company or any Guarantor, solely as among the holders of Parity Lien Obligations and solely for purposes of the corresponding paragraph in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and not any other documents governing Parity Lien Obligations, in the event the value of the Collateral is not sufficient for the entire amount of Post-Petition Interest on the Parity Lien Obligations to be allowed under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding, the amount of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series of Parity Lien Obligations shall include only the maximum amount of Post-Petition Interest on the Parity Lien Obligations allowable under Section 506(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other bankruptcy law in such insolvency or liquidation proceeding. It is the intention of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of each Series that the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of such Series (and not the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of any other Series) bear the risk of any determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that (x) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series are unenforceable under applicable law or are subordinated to any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity Lien Obligations), (y) any of the Parity Lien Obligations of such Series do not have an enforceable security interest in any of the Collateral securing any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations and/or (z) any intervening security interest exists securing any other obligations (other than another Series of Parity Lien Obligations) on a basis ranking prior to the security interest of such Series of Parity Lien Obligations but junior to the security interest of any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations or the existence of any Collateral for any other Series of Parity Lien Obligations that is not Collateral (any such condition referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) or (ii) with respect to any Series of Parity Lien Obligations, an “Impairment” of such Series).

Additionally, in the event the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series are modified pursuant to applicable law (including, without limitation, pursuant to Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code), any reference to such Parity Lien Obligations or the Parity Lien Documents governing such Parity Lien Obligations shall refer to such obligations or such documents as so modified. None of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may institute in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or other proceeding any claim against the Controlling Collateral Agent or any other holder of Parity Lien Obligations seeking damages from or other relief by way of specific performance, instructions or otherwise with respect to any Collateral. In addition, none of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations may seek to have any Collateral or any part thereof marshaled upon any foreclosure or other disposition of such Collateral. If any holder of Parity Lien Obligations obtains possession of any Collateral or realizes any proceeds or payment in respect thereof pursuant to any Parity Lien Security Document or by the exercise of any rights available to it under applicable law or in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding or through any other exercise of remedies (including pursuant to any intercreditor agreement), at any time prior to the discharge of each of the Parity Lien Obligations, then it must hold such Collateral, proceeds or payment in trust for the other holders of Parity Lien Obligations and promptly transfer such Collateral, proceeds or payment to the Controlling Collateral Agent to be distributed in accordance with the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Under the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement, and subject to the terms of the Base Intercreditor Agreement with respect to Current Asset Collateral, if at any time the Controlling Collateral Agent forecloses upon or otherwise exercises remedies against any Collateral, then (whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding is pending at the time) the Liens in favor of the other authorized representatives for the benefit of the Trustee and the holders of the Notes and each other Series of holders of Parity Lien Obligations upon such Collateral will automatically be released and discharged. However, any proceeds of any Collateral realized therefrom will be applied as described in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement. Each holder of Parity Lien Obligations will acknowledge that the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement is a “subordination agreement” under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (or under any equivalent provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law) and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the commencement of any insolvency or liquidation proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or any other applicable bankruptcy law by or against the Company or any Guarantor.

The holders of Parity Lien Obligations will acknowledge that the Parity Lien Obligations of any Series may, subject to the limitations set forth in the other Parity Lien Documents, be increased, extended, renewed, replaced, restated, supplemented, restructured, repaid, refunded, refinanced or otherwise amended or modified from time to time, all without affecting the priority of claims and application of proceeds of the Collateral set forth in the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement or the other provisions thereof defining the relative rights of the holders of Parity Lien Obligations of any Series.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

So long as neither the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations nor the discharge of obligations under the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations has occurred, whether or not any insolvency or liquidation proceeding has been commenced by or against the Company or any Guarantor, any Collateral or proceeds thereof received by any collateral agent or any holders of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligations or holders of Priority Lien Obligations in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy (including set-off) relating to the Collateral or otherwise received in contravention of the Base Intercreditor Agreement shall be segregated and held in trust and forthwith paid over to the appropriate collateral agent with a senior lien on such Collateral for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the Parity Lien Obligations or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be, in the same form as received, with any necessary endorsements or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct. Each collateral agent will, under the Base Intercreditor Agreement, be authorized by the other collateral agents to make any such endorsements as agent for the other collateral agents or any holders of the Notes or Parity Lien Obligations or holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, as the case may be. This authorization is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations and the discharge of obligations under the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations. _Collateral Access Rights_ The Base Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Senior ABL Collateral Agent will have access to and a rent free right to use the Fixed Asset Collateral for the purpose of arranging for and effecting the sale or disposition of Current Asset Collateral, including the production, completion, packaging and other preparation of such Current Asset Collateral for sale or disposition for a period, after the commencement of an enforcement period, which begins on the day that the Base Collateral Agent provides the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent with the notice of its election to request access to any mortgaged premises pursuant to the Base Intercreditor Agreement and ends on the earliest of (i) the 180[th] day after the Senior ABL Collateral Agent obtains the ability to use, take physical possession of, remove or otherwise control the use or access to the Collateral located on such mortgaged premises following a collateral enforcement action plus such number of days, if any, after the Senior ABL Collateral Agent obtains access to such Collateral that it is stayed or otherwise prohibited by law or court order from exercising remedies with respect to Collateral located on such mortgaged premises, (ii) the date on which all or substantially all of the Current Asset Collateral located on such mortgaged premises is sold, collected or liquidated, (iii) the date on which the discharge of the Priority Lien Obligations occurs and (iv) the date on which the event of default that was the subject of the applicable Enforcement Notice (as defined in the Base Intercreditor Agreement) relating to such 210 ----- enforcement period has been cured to the satisfaction of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent or the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, as applicable, or waived in writing in accordance with the requirements of the Senior ABL Agreement, Senior Cash Flow Credit Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes Indenture or the Indenture, as applicable. Each Parity Lien Representative will grant (to the full extent of its rights and interests) the Senior ABL Collateral Agent and its agents, representatives and designees (a) a royalty free, rent free non-exclusive license and lease to use all of the Fixed Asset Collateral constituting intellectual property, to complete the sale of inventory and (b) a royalty free non-exclusive license (which will be binding on any successor or assignee of the intellectual property) to use any and all intellectual property, in each case, at any time in connection with its collateral enforcement action; provided, however, the royalty free, rent free non-exclusive license and lease granted in clause (a) shall immediately expire upon the sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of all such inventory. _Set Off and Tracing_ The Base Intercreditor Agreement provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, all funds deposited in an account subject to a control agreement that constitute Current Asset Collateral and then applied to the Priority Lien Obligations shall be treated as Current Asset Collateral and, unless the Senior ABL Collateral Agent has actual knowledge to the contrary, any claim that payments made to the Senior ABL Collateral Agent through the Deposit Accounts and Securities Accounts that are subject to such control agreements, are Proceeds of or otherwise constitute Fixed Asset Collateral are waived by the Parity Lien Representatives and the holders of Parity Lien Obligations; provided that after the issuance of an Enforcement Notice by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, all identifiable proceeds of Fixed Asset Collateral shall be deemed Fixed Asset Collateral, whether or not held in an account subject to a control agreement. The Base Intercreditor Agreement further provides that prior to an issuance of an Enforcement Notice, any proceeds of Collateral, whether or not deposited in an account subject to a deposit account control agreement or a securities account control agreement, shall not (as between the Parity Lien Representatives, the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, and the respective secured parties) be treated as proceeds of Collateral for purposes of determining the relative priorities in the Collateral. _Release of Liens_ If in connection with the exercise of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent’s remedies in respect of any Collateral as provided for in the Base Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, then the Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, on the Current Asset Collateral sold or disposed of in connection with such exercise, shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or on behalf of the holders of the Notes and any other Parity Lien Obligations, promptly shall execute and deliver to the Senior ABL Collateral Agent or such Company or Guarantor such termination statements, releases and other documents as the Senior ABL Collateral Agent or such Company or Guarantor may request to effectively confirm such release. The Base Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with an exercise of remedies with respect thereto by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent. In addition, if in connection with any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of any Collateral (collectively, permitted under the terms of the Senior ABL Agreement, the Senior Cash Flow Agreement, the Existing Secured Notes Indenture and the Indenture (other than in connection with the exercise of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent’s rights and remedies in respect of the Collateral as 211 ----- provided for in applicable provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement), the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, for itself or on behalf of any of the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations, releases any of its Liens on any part of the Current Asset Collateral, in each case other than (A) in connection with the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations or (B) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Indenture, then the Liens, if any, of each Parity Lien Representative, for itself or for the benefit of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, on such Collateral shall be automatically, unconditionally and simultaneously released. The Base Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to the release of the Liens of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent on the Fixed Asset Collateral in connection with such a sale or other disposition in which the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent releases its Liens on such Fixed Asset Collateral. _Amendments_ The Indenture and the documents governing any other Parity Lien Obligation may be amended, supplemented, amended and restated, replaced, refinanced or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with their terms and the obligations under the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations may be refinanced, in each case, without notice to, or the consent of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent or the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, all without affecting the lien priorities or other provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that any such refinancing shall comply with the applicable provision of the Base Intercreditor Agreement and shall not contravene any provision of the Base Intercreditor Agreement. The Base Intercreditor Agreement contains a reciprocal provision with respect to any amendment of any Priority Lien Obligations documents or refinancing of the Priority Lien Obligations. _Certain Matters in Connection with Insolvency or Liquidation Proceedings_ Until the discharge of Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, if the Company or any Guarantor shall be subject to any insolvency or liquidation proceeding and the Senior ABL Collateral Agent shall desire to permit the use of “Cash Collateral” (as such term is defined in Section 363(a) of the Bankruptcy Code) constituting Current Asset Collateral on which the Senior ABL Collateral Agent or any other creditor has a Lien or to permit the Company or any Guarantor to obtain financing to be secured at least in part by the Current Asset Collateral, whether from the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations or any other Person under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law (“DIP Financing”), then each Parity Lien Representatives, on behalf of itself and the applicable holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that it will raise no objection to such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing so long as such Cash Collateral use or DIP Financing meets the following requirements: (i) each Parity Lien Representative and the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations retain the right to object to any ancillary agreements or arrangements regarding the Cash Collateral use or the DIP Financing that are materially prejudicial to their interests in the Fixed Asset Collateral, and (ii) the terms of the DIP Financing (A) do not expressly require the liquidation of the Collateral prior to a default under the DIP Financing documentation or Cash Collateral order and (B) do not require that any Lien of the Parity Lien Representatives on the Fixed Asset Collateral be subordinated to or pari passu with any Lien on the Fixed Asset Collateral securing such DIP Financing. To the extent the Liens securing the Priority Lien Obligations are subordinated to or pari passu with such DIP Financing which meets the requirements of clause (ii) above, each Parity Lien Representative will subordinate its Liens in the Current Asset Collateral to (1) the Liens thereon securing such DIP Financing (and all Obligations relating thereto), (2) all adequate protection Liens thereon granted to the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, and (3) to any “carve out” therefrom for professional and United States trustee fees that has been agreed to by the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, and will not request adequate protection or any other relief in connection therewith (except, as expressly agreed by the Senior ABL Collateral Agent or to the extent permitted by the applicable section of the Base Intercreditor Agreement). The 212 ----- Base Intercreditor Agreement provides for a similar restriction on the ability of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations to object to a proposed DIP Financing that would be secured at least in part by the Fixed Asset Collateral or to the use of any Fixed Asset Collateral constituting cash collateral that has been approved by the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent, provided that similar conditions with respect to the Current Asset Collateral and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations would be satisfied in connection therewith. Until the discharge of the Priority Lien Obligations has occurred, each Parity Lien Representative, on behalf of itself and the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, agrees that none of them shall seek (or support any other Person seeking) relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Current Asset Collateral, without the prior written consent of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not seek relief from the automatic stay or any other stay in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding in respect of the Foreign Collateral. The Base Intercreditor Agreement provides for a reciprocal restriction on the ability of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations to seek relief from the automatic stay with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledges and agrees in the Base Intercreditor Agreement that the grants of Liens pursuant to the Security Documents (as defined in the Senior ABL Agreement) and the Fixed Asset Liens constitute separate and distinct grants of Liens, and because of, among other things, their differing rights in the Collateral, the Parity Lien Obligations are fundamentally different from the Priority Lien Obligations and must be separately classified in any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan proposed, confirmed or adopted in an insolvency or liquidation proceeding. To further effectuate the intent of the parties as provided in the foregoing sentence, if it is held that the claims of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations and the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations in respect of the Collateral constitute only one secured claim (rather than separate classes of secured claims subject to the relative Lien priority set forth in the Base Intercreditor Agreement with respect to such Collateral, it being understood that in accordance with the other provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement, the holders of Parity Lien Obligations do not have any secured claim with respect to Foreign Collateral), then each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledge and agree that, subject to the Lien priority and application of proceeds provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement, all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of senior and junior secured claims against the Company and the Guarantors in respect of the Collateral (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Current Asset Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations), the holders of the Priority Lien Obligations shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest, fees, expenses and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of Post-Petition Interest, including any additional interest payable pursuant to the Senior ABL Agreement arising from or related to a default, whether or not a claim therefor is allowed or allowable in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding) before any distribution is made from the Current Asset Collateral in respect of the claims held by the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations, with each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, amounts otherwise received or receivable by them from the Current Asset Collateral to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the claim or recovery of the holders of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations. The Senior ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to a reciprocal provision with respect to distributions from the Fixed 213 ----- Asset Collateral and the potential turn over thereof to the Controlling Fixed Asset Collateral Agent by the holders of Priority Lien Obligations. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, and the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, for itself and on behalf of the holders of Priority Lien Obligations, acknowledge and agree in the Base Intercreditor Agreement that no holder of Priority Lien Obligations nor any holder of the Notes or the other Parity Lien Obligations (whether in the capacity of a secured creditor or an unsecured creditor) shall propose, vote for, or otherwise support directly or indirectly any plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan that is inconsistent with the priorities or other provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, if, in any insolvency or liquidation proceeding involving the Company or a Guarantor, debt obligations of the reorganized debtor secured by Liens upon any property of the reorganized debtor are distributed or reinstated (in whole or in part) pursuant to a plan of reorganization or similar dispositive restructuring plan, both on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and on account of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, then, to the extent the debt obligations distributed on account of the Priority Lien Obligations and on account of the Parity Lien Obligations are secured by Liens upon the same property, the provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement will survive the distribution of such debt obligations pursuant to such plan and will apply with like effect to the Liens securing such debt obligations. Subject to certain designated provisions of the Base Intercreditor Agreement, each Parity Lien Representative agrees that it will consent, and will not object or oppose, or support any party in opposing, a motion to dispose of any Current Asset Collateral free and clear of any Liens or other claims under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law if the requisite holders of the Priority Lien Obligations under the Senior ABL Agreement have consented to such disposition of the Current Asset Collateral, such motion does not impair, subject to the priorities set forth in the Base Intercreditor Agreement, the rights of the Parity Lien Representatives under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law (so long as the right of any holder of the Notes or other Parity Lien Obligation to offset its claim against the purchase price for any Current Asset Collateral exists only after the Priority Lien Obligations have been paid in full in cash and/or in such other form of consideration as may be agreed to by the holders of Priority Lien Obligations), and the terms of any proposed order approving such transaction provide for the respective Liens to attach to the proceeds of the Current Asset Collateral that is the subject of such disposition, subject to the Lien priorities in the Base Intercreditor Agreement and the other terms and conditions thereof. Each Parity Lien Representative further agrees that it will not oppose, or support any party in opposing, the right of the ABL Collateral Agent to credit bid under Section 363(k) of the Bankruptcy Code or any similar provision of any other applicable bankruptcy law with respect to the Current Asset Collateral, subject to the provision of the immediately preceding sentence with respect to the Fixed Asset Collateral. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to reciprocal restrictions on their ability to object to, or credit bid with respect to, any proposed sale of Fixed Asset Collateral. Each Parity Lien Representative, for itself and on behalf of the holders of the Notes and the other Parity Lien Obligations, will also agree to certain limitations of their rights with respect to the Current Asset Collateral in an insolvency and liquidation proceeding, including (1) the right to object to requests for adequate protection by the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations and other limitations on their own rights to seek adequate protection, (2) the right to object to certain requests by the ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations for Post-Petition Interest, and (3) waivers of certain rights under Sections 506(c) and 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The ABL Collateral Agent and the holders of Priority Lien Obligations will agree to reciprocal limitations and waivers. 214 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

On the Effective Date, the Note Collateral Agent will, together with the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent, become party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement to set forth their relative rights in the Collateral, which will provide for the pari passu nature of their Liens, including any Liens that may, in the future, secure additional Parity Lien Indebtedness. In addition, on the Effective Date, the Note Collateral Agent will, together with the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent and the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, enter into the Base Intercreditor Agreement, which will govern the relative rights of the Liens on the Collateral in favor of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent, the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent and the Note Collateral Agent, and will provide for the senior priority of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent in the Current Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent, the Note Collateral Agent and the representative of any other Parity Lien Indebtedness, and also will provide for the senior priority of the Senior Cash Flow Collateral Agent and the Note Collateral Agent in the Fixed Asset Collateral relative to the Liens thereon of the Senior ABL Collateral Agent. If any other Indebtedness is designated as Parity Lien Indebtedness and is permitted by the terms of the Indenture to be secured by the Collateral, the representatives of the holders of such other Indebtedness will also become a party to the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the Base Intercreditor Agreement. The Indenture will provide that such intercreditor agreements may be amended from time to time without the consent of the holders of the Notes to, among other things, add other parties. Holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed and accepted the terms of the Pari Passu Intercreditor Agreement and the Base Intercreditor Agreement and to have authorized and directed the 203 ----- Note Collateral Agent (and Trustee, if applicable) to enter into and perform its obligations under the Intercreditor Agreements, binding the Holders to the terms thereof by their acceptance of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The term “Change of Control” means: (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders or a Parent, becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company; provided that (x) so long as the Company is a Subsidiary of any Parent, no “person” shall be deemed to be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company unless such “person” shall be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such Parent (other than a Parent that is a Subsidiary of another Parent) and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the “beneficial owner” shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such “person” is the “beneficial owner”; or (ii) the Company sells or transfers, in one or a series of related transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, another Person (other than one or more Permitted Holders) and any “person” (as defined in clause (i) above), other than one or more Permitted Holders or any Parent, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the transferee Person in such sale or transfer of assets, as the case may be; provided that (x) so long as such transferee Person is a Subsidiary of a parent Person, no “person” shall be deemed to be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such transferee Person unless such “person” shall be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such parent Person (other than a parent Person that is a Subsidiary of another parent Person) and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the “beneficial owner” shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such “person” is the beneficial owner. For the purpose of this definition, so long as at the time of any Minority Business Disposition or any Minority Business Offering the Minority Business Disposition Condition is met, the Minority Business Assets shall not be deemed at any time to constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and any sale or transfer of all or any part of the Minority Business Assets (whether directly or indirectly, whether by sale or transfer of any such assets, or of any Capital Stock or other interest in any Person holding such assets, or by merger or consolidation or any combination thereof, and whether in one or more transactions, or otherwise, including any Minority Business Offering or any Minority Business Disposition) shall not be deemed at any time to constitute a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In the event that, at the time of such Change of Control, the terms of any Credit Facility Indebtedness constituting Designated Senior Indebtedness restrict or prohibit the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to this covenant, then prior to the sending of the notice to Holders provided for in the 215 ----- immediately following paragraph but in any event not later than 30 days following the date the Company obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, (i) repay in full all such Credit Facility Indebtedness subject to such terms or offer to repay in full all such Credit Facility Indebtedness and repay the Credit Facility Indebtedness of each lender who has accepted such offer or (ii) obtain the requisite consent under the agreements governing such Credit Facility Indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the Notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraph. The Company shall first comply with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence before it shall be required to repurchase Notes pursuant to the provisions described below. The Company’s failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph or the provisions of the immediately following paragraph shall constitute an Event of Default described in clause (iv) and not in clause (ii) under “—Defaults” below. Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company shall, not later than 30 days following the date the Company obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, send a notice (a “Change of _Control Offer”) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has_ occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Company to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date); (2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent, except that such notice may be delivered more than 60 days prior to the purchase date if the purchase date is delayed as provided in clause (4) of this paragraph); (3) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased; and (4) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control and that the purchase date may, in the Company’s discretion, be delayed until such time as the Change of Control has occurred. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, to the extent a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at such time, the Company (or any Affiliate of the Company) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in connection with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes, the Parent Guarantee and/or Subsidiary Guarantees. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer or an Alternate Offer 216 ----- and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer or any Affiliate of the Company making an Alternate Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party or such Affiliate will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such Change of Control Offer or such Alternate Offer, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% in the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn the Notes in an offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled or managed by an Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such offer. The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Company has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Company to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness.” Such restrictions can be waived with only the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control could constitute a default under the Senior ABL Agreement. The Senior Cash Flow Agreement and the Existing Indentures each require that the lenders thereunder or holders of notes, as applicable, be offered the option to have their loans repaid or notes redeemed, as applicable, upon a Change of Control. Agreements governing other Indebtedness of the Company or of its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid (or for holders of such Indebtedness to be offered the option to be repurchased or repaid) upon a Change of Control. Agreements governing other Indebtedness of the Company or of its Restricted Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control unless the Indebtedness governed by such agreements has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s 217 ----- obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company also has the right to redeem the Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Offering and the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control as required by the terms of the indentures that will govern the Notes.” The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Although there is a body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and therefore it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether the Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase such Notes. As noted above, under certain circumstances the Minority Business Assets shall not at any time be deemed to constitute “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence after the Effective Date of a Change of Control (as defined below), each Holder of Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of such Notes at a purchase price in cash (the “Change of Control Payment”) equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of repurchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date); provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to repurchase Notes pursuant to this covenant in the event that it has exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption.” The Transactions shall not constitute or give rise to a Change of Control. The term “Change of Control” means: (i) any “person” (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Issue Date), other than one or more Permitted Holders or a Parent, becomes the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Issue Date), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company; provided that (x) so long as the Company is a Subsidiary of any Parent, no “person” shall be deemed to be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of the Company unless such “person” shall be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such Parent (other than a Parent that is a Subsidiary of another Parent) and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the “beneficial owner” shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such “person” is the “beneficial owner”; or (ii) the Company sells or transfers, in one or a series of related transactions, all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to, another Person (other than one or more Permitted Holders) and any “person” (as defined in clause (i) above), other than one or more Permitted Holders or any Parent, is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock 317 ----- of the transferee Person in such sale or transfer of assets, as the case may be; provided that (x) so long as such transferee Person is a Subsidiary of a parent Person, no “person” shall be deemed to be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such transferee Person unless such “person” shall be or become a “beneficial owner” of more than 50.0% of the total voting power of the Voting Stock of such parent Person (other than a parent Person that is a Subsidiary of another parent Person) and (y) any Voting Stock of which any Permitted Holder is the “beneficial owner” shall not in any case be included in any Voting Stock of which any such “person” is the beneficial owner. For the purpose of this definition, so long as at the time of any Minority Business Disposition or any Minority Business Offering the Minority Business Disposition Condition is met, the Minority Business Assets shall not be deemed at any time to constitute all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries, and any sale or transfer of all or any part of the Minority Business Assets (whether directly or indirectly, whether by sale or transfer of any such assets, or of any Capital Stock or other interest in any Person holding such assets, or by merger or consolidation or any combination thereof, and whether in one or more transactions, or otherwise, including any Minority Business Offering or any Minority Business Disposition) shall not be deemed at any time to constitute a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries. In the event that, at the time of such Change of Control, the terms of any Credit Facility Indebtedness constituting Designated Senior Indebtedness restrict or prohibit the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to this covenant, then prior to the sending of the notice to Holders provided for in the immediately following paragraph but in any event not later than 30 days following the date the Company obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control (unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption”), the Company shall, or shall cause one or more of its Subsidiaries to, (i) repay in full all such Credit Facility Indebtedness subject to such terms or offer to repay in full all such Credit Facility Indebtedness and repay the Credit Facility Indebtedness of each lender who has accepted such offer or (ii) obtain the requisite consent under the agreements governing such Credit Facility Indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the Notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraph. The Company shall first comply with the provisions of the immediately preceding sentence before it shall be required to repurchase Notes pursuant to the provisions described below. The Company’s failure to comply with the provisions of this paragraph or the provisions of the immediately following paragraph shall constitute an Event of Default described in clause (iv) and not in clause (ii) under “—Defaults” below. Unless the Company has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company shall, not later than 30 days following the date the Company obtains actual knowledge of any Change of Control having occurred, send a notice (a “Change of _Control Offer”) to each Holder with a copy to the Trustee stating: (1) that a Change of Control has_ occurred or may occur and that such Holder has, or upon such occurrence will have, the right to require the Company to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101.0% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to but not including the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the purchase date); (2) the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is sent, except that such notice may be delivered more than 60 days prior to the purchase date if the purchase date is delayed as provided in clause (4) of this paragraph); (3) the instructions determined by the Company, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes purchased; and (4) if such notice is sent prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, that such offer is conditioned on the occurrence of such Change of Control and that the purchase date may, in the Company’s discretion, 318 ----- be delayed until such time as the Change of Control has occurred. No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. The Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) in connection with or in contemplation of any Change of Control, to the extent a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at such time, the Company (or any Affiliate of the Company) has made an offer to purchase (an “Alternate Offer”) any and all Notes validly tendered at a cash price equal to or higher than the Change of Control Payment and has purchased all Notes properly tendered in connection with the terms of the Alternate Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer. A Change of Control Offer or Alternate Offer may be made at the same time as consents are solicited with respect to an amendment, supplement or waiver of the Indenture, Notes and/or Subsidiary Guarantees. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes of any series validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer or an Alternate Offer and the Company, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer or any Affiliate of the Company making an Alternate Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company or such third party or such Affiliate will have the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to such Change of Control Offer or such Alternate Offer, to redeem all Notes of such series that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date of such redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date falling prior to or on the Redemption Date). In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% in the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn the Notes in an offer, Notes owned by an Affiliate of the Company or by funds controlled or managed by an Affiliate of the Company, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such offer. The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this covenant, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Company and the Initial Purchasers. The Company has no present plans to engage in a transaction involving a Change of Control, although it is possible that the Company could decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below, the Company could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of Indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Company’s capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of the Company to 319 ----- Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants— Limitation on Indebtedness.” Such restrictions can be waived with only the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenant, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The occurrence of a Change of Control could constitute a default under the Senior ABL Agreement. The Senior Cash Flow Agreement and the Existing Indentures each require that the lenders thereunder or holders of notes, as applicable, be offered the option to have their loans repaid or notes redeemed, as applicable, upon a Change of Control. Agreements governing other Indebtedness of the Company or of its Restricted Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid (or for holders of such Indebtedness to be offered the option to be repurchased or repaid) upon a Change of Control. Agreements governing other Indebtedness of the Company or of its Restricted Subsidiaries may prohibit the Company from repurchasing the Notes upon a Change of Control unless the Indebtedness governed by such agreements has been repurchased or repaid (or an offer made to effect such repurchase or repayment has been made and the Indebtedness of those creditors accepting such offer has been repurchased or repaid) and/or other specified requirements have been met. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Company to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under such agreements, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Company and its Subsidiaries. Finally, the Company’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Company’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. As described above under “—Optional Redemption,” the Company also has the right to redeem the Notes at specified prices, in whole or in part, upon a Change of Control or otherwise. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to the Offering and the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control as required by the terms of the indenture that will govern the Notes.” The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale or other transfer of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

(b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) above, the Company will be required to purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Company for the Notes (the “Offer”) at a purchase price of 100.0% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but not including the date of purchase in accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of oversubscription) set forth in the Indenture. If the aggregate purchase price of the Notes tendered pursuant to the Offer is less than the Net Available Cash allotted to the purchase of Notes, the remaining Net Available Cash will be available to the Company and the Restricted Subsidiaries for use in accordance with clause (iii)(B) of paragraph (a) above (to repay other Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) or clause (iii)(C) of paragraph (a) above. The Company shall not be required to make an Offer for Notes pursuant to this covenant if the Net Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clause (iii)(A) of paragraph (a) above) is less than the greater of $110.0 million and 15.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amounts shall be carried forward for purposes of determining whether an Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any subsequent Asset Disposition). No Note will be repurchased in part if less than the Minimum Denomination in original principal amount of such Note would be left outstanding. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Company’s obligation to make an Offer for Notes pursuant to this covenant may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. (c) The Company will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. However, a Default under clause (iv), (v), (vi) or (xi) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company in writing of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders more than two years prior to such notice of Default, may not be given and any such notice shall be invalid and have no effect. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a “Notice of Default.” When a Default or an Event of Default is cured, it ceases. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, in either case specifying in such notice the respective Event of Default and that such notice is a “notice of acceleration,” may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to institute suit for the enforcement of payment of principal and interest of any Note of such Holder on or after the respective Stated Maturity for such principal or interest payment dates for such interest expressed in such Note, no Holder may pursue any remedy (including, without limitation, taking or instituting any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy or asserting any other cause of action against the Company or any Subsidiary Guarantor (including the exercise of any right of set-off, rights on account of any banker’s lien or similar 247 ----- claim or other rights of self-help), or instituting any actions or proceedings or any other cause of action, or otherwise commencing any remedial procedures) with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity, and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision may be enforced against any Holder by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the Trustee or the Company (or any of its Affiliates) and each Holder expressly acknowledges that this provision shall be available as a defense of the Company (or any of its Affiliates) in any action, proceeding, cause of action or remedial procedure. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after a Trust Officer of the Trustee has obtained actual knowledge thereof. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Noteholders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, (1) within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company ending December 31, 2021 and (2) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending thereafter, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default occurring during the previous year. The Company is also required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have obtained actual knowledge thereof and a written notice of such an event has been received by the Trustee at its corporate trust office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.” An Event of Default will be defined in the Indenture as: (i) a default in any payment of interest on any Note when due, continued for 30 days; (ii) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due, whether at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise; 345 ----- (iii) the failure by the Company to comply with its obligations under the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and Consolidation” above; (iv) the failure by the Company to comply for 30 days after notice with any of its obligations under the covenant described under “—Change of Control” above (other than a failure to purchase Notes); (v) the failure by the Company to comply for (x) 180 days after notice of the failure by the Company to comply with any of its obligations under the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—SEC Reports” or (y) 60 days after notice of the failure by the Company to comply with its other agreements contained in the Notes or the Indenture; (vi) the failure by any Subsidiary Guarantor to comply for 45 days after notice with its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee; (vii) the failure by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness in relation to which the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary is contesting such default in good faith and any Indebtedness arising pursuant to a Special Purpose Financing or a Financing Disposition if and to the extent permitted under the Indenture) within any applicable grace period after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a default, if the total amount of such Indebtedness so unpaid or accelerated exceeds the greater of $150.0 million and 20.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA or its foreign currency equivalent; provided that no Default or Event of Default will be deemed to occur with respect to any such Indebtedness that is paid or otherwise acquired or retired (or for which such failure to pay or acceleration is waived or rescinded) within 20 Business Days after such failure to pay or such acceleration (the “cross acceleration provision”); (viii) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company or a Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”); (ix) the rendering of any judgment or decree for the payment of money in an amount (net of any insurance or indemnity payments actually received in respect thereof prior to or within 90 days from the entry thereof, or to be received in respect thereof in the event of any appeal thereof shall be unsuccessful, or that the Company has determined there exists reasonable evidence that such amount will be reimbursed by the insurer or indemnifying party and such amount is not denied by the applicable insurer or indemnifying party in writing within 180 days and is reimbursed within 365 days of the date of such evidence) in excess of the greater of $150.0 million and 20.0% of Four Quarter Consolidated EBITDA or its foreign currency equivalent against the Company or a Significant Subsidiary that is not discharged, satisfied, supported by a letter of credit or bonded or insured by a third Person, if such judgment or decree remains outstanding for a period of 90 days following such judgment or decree and is not discharged, waived or stayed (the “judgment default provision”); or (x) the failure of any Subsidiary Guarantee by a Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary to be in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof or of the Indenture) or the denial or disaffirmation in writing by any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Significant Subsidiary of its obligations under the Indenture or any Subsidiary Guarantee (other than by reason of the termination of the Indenture or such Subsidiary Guarantee or the release of such Subsidiary Guarantee in accordance with such Subsidiary Guarantee or the Indenture), if such Default continues for 10 days. The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body. 346 ----- However, a Default under clause (iv), (v) or (vi) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Company in writing of the Default and the Company does not cure such Default within the time specified in such clause after receipt of such notice; provided that a notice of Default with respect to any action taken, and reported publicly or to Holders more than two years prior to such notice of Default, may not be given and any such notice shall be invalid and have no effect. Such notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a “Notice of Default.” When a Default or an Event of Default is cured, it ceases. If an Event of Default (other than a Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by written notice to the Company, or the Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, in either case specifying in such notice the respective Event of Default and that such notice is a “notice of acceleration,” may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon the effectiveness of such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Company occurs and is continuing, the principal of and accrued but unpaid interest on all the outstanding Notes will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect to the Notes and its consequences. Any time period in the Indenture to cure any actual or alleged Default or Event of Default may be extended or stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent such actual or alleged Default or Event of Default is the subject of litigation. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered, and if requested, provided to the Trustee indemnity or security satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. Except to institute suit for the enforcement of payment of principal and interest of any Note of such Holder on or after the respective Stated Maturity for such principal or interest payment dates for such interest expressed in such Note, no Holder may pursue any remedy (including, without limitation, taking or instituting any actions or proceedings, judicial or otherwise, for any right or remedy or asserting any other cause of action against the Company or Subsidiary Guarantor (including the exercise of any right of set-off, rights on account of any banker’s lien or similar claim or other rights of self-help), or instituting any actions or proceedings or any other cause of action, or otherwise commencing any remedial procedures) with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless (i) such Holder has previously given the Trustee written notice that an Event of Default is continuing, (ii) Holders of at least 30.0% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in writing to pursue the remedy, (iii) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense, (iv) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity, and (v) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. For the avoidance of doubt, this provision may be enforced against any Holder by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes, the Trustee or the Company (or any of its Affiliates) and each Holder expressly acknowledges that this provision shall be available as a defense of the Company (or any of its Affiliates) in any action, proceeding, cause of action or remedial procedure. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to 347 ----- direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and is actually known to a Trust Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee must send to each Holder notice of the Default within 90 days after a Trust Officer of the Trustee has obtained actual knowledge thereof. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Noteholders. In addition, the Company is required to deliver to the Trustee, (1) within 150 days after the end of the fiscal year of the Company ending December 31, 2021 and (2) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company ending thereafter, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default occurring during the previous year. The Company is also required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any event that would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Company is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Trustee will not be deemed to have knowledge of any Defaults or Events of Default unless a Trust Officer of the Trustee shall have obtained actual knowledge thereof and a written notice of such an event has been received by the Trustee at its corporate trust office specified in the Indenture and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture and states that it is a “Notice of Default.”",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Upon issuance, each of the global notes will be deposited with the trustee as custodian for DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. Ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC, which we refer to as DTC participants, or persons who hold beneficial interests through DTC participants. We expect that under procedures established by DTC: - upon deposit of each global note with DTC’s custodian, DTC will credit portions of the principal amount of the global note to the accounts of the DTC participants designated by the initial purchasers; and - ownership of beneficial interests in each global note will be shown on, and transfer of ownership of those interests will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC (with respect to interests of DTC participants) and the records of DTC participants (with respect to other owners of beneficial interests in the global note). Beneficial interests in the Regulation S global notes will initially be credited within DTC to Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Luxembourg, société anonyme (“Clearstream”) on behalf of the owners of these interests. During the Resale Restriction Period described below, beneficial interests in the Regulation S global notes may be held only through Euroclear and Clearstream unless transferred to a person that takes delivery through a Rule 144A global note in accordance with the certification requirements described below. After the Resale Restriction Period ends, beneficial interests in the temporary Regulation S global notes may be exchanged for beneficial interests in the permanent Regulation S global notes upon certification that those interests are owned either by non-U.S. persons or by U.S. persons who purchased those interests pursuant to an exemption from, or in transactions not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Investors may hold their interests in the permanent Regulation S global note directly through Euroclear or Clearstream, if they are participants in those systems, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. After the Resale Restriction Period ends, investors may also hold their interests in the permanent Regulation S global notes through organizations other than Euroclear or Clearstream that are DTC participants. Each of Euroclear and Clearstream will appoint a DTC participant to act as its depositary for the interests in the Regulation S global notes that are held within DTC for the account of each settlement system on behalf of its participants. 400 ----- Beneficial interests in the global notes may not be exchanged for notes in physical, certificated form except in the limited circumstances described below. Each global note and beneficial interests in each global note will be subject to restrictions on transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” These restrictions on transfer will apply from the issue date until the date that is one year, in the case of Rule 144A notes, or 40 days, in the case of Regulation S notes, after the later of the issue date and the last date that we or any of our affiliates were the owner of the Notes or any predecessor of the Notes, which period we refer to as the “Resale Restriction Period,” and will not apply after the Resale Restriction Period ends.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

518,Offerings 2021.md,59,DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS,59.62,Book-Entry Procedures for the Global Notes,59.62.1,,"All interests in the global notes will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the trustee or the initial purchasers, or any agent of the foregoing parties, is responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised us that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York; - a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law; - a member of the Federal Reserve System; - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code; and - a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between its participants through electronic book-entry changes to the accounts of its participants. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers, including the initial purchasers; banks and trust companies; clearing corporations and other organizations. Indirect access to DTC’s system is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies; these indirect participants clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a DTC participant, either directly or indirectly. Investors who are not DTC participants may beneficially own securities held by or on behalf of DTC only through DTC participants or indirect participants in DTC. 401 ----- So long as DTC’s nominee is the registered owner of a global note, that nominee will be considered the sole owner or holder of the Notes represented by that global note for all purposes under the indentures that will govern the Notes. Except as provided below, owners of beneficial interests in a global note: - will not be entitled to have Notes represented by the global note registered in their names; - will not receive or be entitled to receive physical, certificated notes; and - will not be considered the owners or holders of the Notes under the indentures that will govern the Notes for any purpose, including with respect to the giving of any direction, instruction or approval to the trustee. As a result, each investor who owns a beneficial interest in a global note must rely on the procedures of DTC to exercise any rights of a holder of Notes under the indentures that will govern the Notes (and, if the investor is not a participant or an indirect participant in DTC, on the procedures of the DTC participant through which the investor owns its interest). Payments of principal, premium (if any) and interest with respect to the Notes represented by a global note will be made by the paying agent to DTC’s nominee as the registered holder of the global note. Neither we nor the trustee (nor our or its agents) will have any responsibility or liability for the payment of amounts to owners of beneficial interests in a global note, for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of those interests by DTC, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records of DTC relating to those interests. Payments by participants and indirect participants in DTC to the owners of beneficial interests in a global note will be governed by standing instructions and customary industry practice and will be the responsibility of those participants or indirect participants and DTC. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected under DTC’s procedures and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way under the rules and operating procedures of those systems. Cross market transfers between DTC participants, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be effected within DTC through the DTC participants that are acting as depositaries for Euroclear and Clearstream. To deliver or receive an interest in a global note held in a Euroclear or Clearstream account, an investor must send transfer instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, under the rules and procedures of that system and within the established deadlines of that system. If the transaction meets its settlement requirements, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, will send instructions to its DTC depositary to take action to effect final settlement by delivering or receiving interests in the relevant global notes in DTC, and making or receiving payment under normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Euroclear and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the DTC depositaries that are acting for Euroclear or Clearstream. Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant that purchases an interest in a global note from a DTC participant will be credited on the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream immediately following the DTC settlement date. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream from the sale of an interest in a global note to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following the DTC settlement date. 402 ----- DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the above procedures to facilitate transfers of interests in the global notes among participants in those settlement systems. However, the settlement systems are not obligated to perform these procedures and may discontinue or change these procedures at any time. Neither we nor the trustee (nor our or its agents) will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

In the case of payments made to a “foreign financial institution” (such as a bank, a broker, an investment fund or, in certain cases, a holding company), as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary, this tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such institution (i) has agreed to (and does) comply with the requirements of an agreement with the United States (an “FFI Agreement”) or (ii) is required by (and does comply with) applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign jurisdiction (an “IGA”) to, among other things, collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities or other relevant tax authorities certain information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution and, in either case, such institution provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status. In the case of payments made to a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner), the tax generally will be imposed, subject to certain exceptions, unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification as to its FATCA status and, in certain cases, identifies any “substantial” U.S. owner (generally, any specified U.S. person that directly or indirectly owns more than a specified percentage of such entity). If a Note is held through a foreign financial institution that has agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement or is subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA, such foreign financial institution (or, in certain cases, a person paying amounts to such foreign financial institution) generally will be required, subject to certain exceptions, to withhold tax on payments made to (i) a person (including an individual) that fails to provide any required information or documentation or (ii) a foreign financial institution that has not agreed to comply with the requirements of an FFI Agreement and is not subject to similar requirements under applicable foreign law enacted in connection with an IGA.

518,Offerings 2021.md,1107,U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS,1107.5,,1107.5.1,,"The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes by U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders (each as defined below) that purchase such Notes at their issue price (generally the first price at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold, excluding sales to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) pursuant to this offering and hold such Notes as capital assets. This discussion is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), U.S. Treasury regulations promulgated or proposed thereunder and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, all as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect, or to different interpretation. This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to specific Holders (as defined below) in light of their particular circumstances (including Holders that are directly or indirectly related to us and accrual method Holders that have an “applicable financial statement”) or to Holders subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law (such as banks, insurance companies, dealers in securities or other Holders that generally mark their securities to market for U.S. federal income tax purposes, tax-exempt entities, retirement plans, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, certain former citizens or residents of the United States, Holders that hold a Note as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion or other integrated transaction or U.S. Holders that have a “functional currency” other than the U.S. dollar). This discussion does not address any U.S. state or local or non-U.S. tax considerations or any U.S. federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax considerations. As used in this discussion, the term “U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source or (iv) a trust (x) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (y) that has in effect a valid election under applicable U.S. Treasury regulations to be treated as a U.S. person. As used in this discussion, the term “Non-U.S. Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Note that is neither a U.S. Holder nor a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the term “Holder” means a U.S. Holder or a Non-U.S. Holder. If an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes invests in a Note, the U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to such investment will depend in part upon the status and activities of such entity and the particular partner. Any such entity should consult its own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to it and its partners relating to the purchase, ownership and disposition of a Note. EACH PERSON CONSIDERING AN INVESTMENT IN THE NOTES SHOULD CONSULT ITS OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. INCOME, ESTATE AND OTHER TAX CONSIDERATIONS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE, OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE NOTES IN LIGHT OF ITS PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

If we are a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a Plan (either directly or by reason of our ownership of any subsidiaries), the purchase and holding of the Notes by or on behalf of the Plan may be a prohibited transaction under Section 406(a)(1) of ERISA or Section 4975(c)(1) of the Code, unless exemptive relief were available under an applicable administrative or statutory exemption. Any particular transaction involving a party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, the fiduciary of a Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) are not subject to these “prohibited transaction” rules of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to Similar Laws. Each Plan and other plan subject to Similar Laws should consider the fact that none of the Transaction Parties will act as a fiduciary to any Plan or other plan subject to Similar Laws with respect to the decision to acquire Notes and is not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to such decision. Accordingly, each purchaser or transferee, by its purchase or holding of such Notes or any interest therein, shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that either (i) no portion of the assets used by it to acquire or hold the Notes or any interest therein constitutes assets of any Plan or other plan subject to Similar Laws or (ii)(A) the acquisition, holding and subsequent disposition of the Notes or any interest therein by it will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws and (B) none of the Transaction Parties is its fiduciary with respect to the decision to acquire and hold the Notes. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive. Due to the complexity of the applicable rules, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the Notes on behalf of or with “plan assets” of any Plan or governmental, church or non-U.S. plan consult with their counsel regarding the relevant provisions of ERISA and the Code and any other provision under any Similar Laws and the availability of exemptive relief applicable to the purchase, holding and disposition of the Notes. 412 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the offering price of either series of the Notes and any other selling terms. The initial purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their affiliates. The offering of the Notes by the initial purchasers is subject to receipt and acceptance of orders by the initial purchasers and subject to the initial purchasers’ right to reject any order in whole or in part. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Notes are subject to restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” In the purchase agreement, each of the initial purchasers has agreed that: - the Notes may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons except in accordance with Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act; and - during the initial distribution of the Notes, it will offer or sell Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in compliance with Rule 144A and to non-U.S. persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S. In addition, with respect to the Notes initially sold outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S, until 40 days following the commencement of this offering, an offer or sale of Notes 413 ----- within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act unless the dealer makes the offer or sale in compliance with Rule 144A or another exemption from registration under the Securities Act. In the purchase agreement, the Issuer will agree that, subject to certain exceptions: - during the period of 90 days following the issue date of the Notes, without the prior written consent of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, the Issuer will not, and will not allow any of its subsidiaries or other affiliates over which it exercises management or voting control, to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, any securities of the Issuer that are of the same class as or substantially identical to the Notes or any of the Issuer’s securities convertible or exchangeable for the securities of the Issuer of the same class as or substantially identical to the Notes (other than as contemplated by the purchase agreement); and - the Issuer and the guarantors will indemnify the several initial purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments that the initial purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on or about, 2021, which will be the business day following the date of pricing of the Notes (such settlement cycle being herein referred to as “T+ ”). Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes prior to the date that is two business days preceding the settlement date will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Notes initially will settle T+, to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of Notes who wish to trade Notes during such period should consult their own advisor. The Notes are new issues of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for either series of the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” We do not intend to apply for either series of the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange or to arrange for the inclusion of either series of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. Certain of the initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make markets in the respective series of the Notes, but are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue any market making in either series of the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market for either series of the Notes will develop or be maintained, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our operating performance and financial condition, general economic conditions and other factors. In connection with the offering of the Notes, the initial purchasers may engage in overallotment, stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If the initial purchasers engage in stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, they may discontinue them at any time without notice. Neither we nor any of the initial purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of either series of the Notes. 414 ----- The initial purchasers and their affiliates have in the past engaged, currently engage in and may in the future engage in transactions with and perform services for us, including commercial banking, financial advisory and investment banking services, in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or will receive customary fees and expenses. The initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates are expected to be lenders, agents and/or arrangers under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and, as consideration therefor, have received or will receive customary fees and expenses in connection with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. An affiliate of Barclays Capital Inc. will act as the administrative agent under the Senior Cash Flow Credit Facilities and the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility, and, in each case, the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates act as lender or agent thereunder and, as consideration therefor, have received or will receive customary fees and expenses in connection with the Senior Cash Flow Credit Facilities and the Senior ABL Revolving Credit Facility. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.” In addition, the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates have also agreed to provide interim financing to the Issuer with respect to an unsecured bridge facility to finance a portion of the Transactions under certain circumstances in the event that the offering is not consummated, for which the initial purchasers or such affiliates will be paid customary fees. These bridge commitments will be reduced by an amount equal to the aggregate gross proceeds of this offering. Certain of the initial purchasers or their respective affiliates are lenders under the Existing MCC ABL Revolver and the Existing MCC Term Loans, and as such will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this offering. Additionally, certain initial purchasers are serving as financial advisors to the sponsor or the companies in connection with the Transactions, for which they may receive customary fees. If any of the initial purchasers or their affiliates has a lending relationship with us, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, and certain other of those initial purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. A typical hedging strategy would include these initial purchasers or their affiliates hedging such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the initial purchasers and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the Issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the Issuer. The initial purchasers and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

The Company’s operating segments have historically had similar economic characteristics and are expected to have similar economic characteristics and long-term financial performance in future periods. Use of Estimates in Financial Statements On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions due to among other reasons, the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions due to the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) global pandemic that has impacted, and may continue to impact, our sales channels, supply chain, manufacturing operations, workforce, or other key aspects of our operations. Business Combinations The Company allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The Company utilizes management estimates and an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining these fair values. The excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is adjusted for any changes to acquisition date fair value amounts made within the measurement period. Acquisition-related transaction costs are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred. The Company is required to provide additional disclosures about fair value measurements as part of the consolidated financial statements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (including business acquisitions). The working capital assets and liabilities, as well as the property and equipment acquired, were valued using Level 2 inputs which included data points that are observable, such as definitive sales agreements, appraisals or established market values of comparable assets (market approach). Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets were valued using Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable by nature, and included internal estimates of future cash flows (income approach). Significant increases (decreases) in any of those unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Management used a third-party valuation firm to assist in the determination of the purchase accounting fair values and specifically those considered Level 3 measurements. Management ultimately oversees the third-party valuation firm to ensure that the transaction-specific assumptions are appropriate for the Company. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when either services are performed or the performance obligation under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the performance of the service or transfer of the inventory. See Note 4 Revenue Recognition for additional disclosure. Cost of Revenues Cost of revenues primarily consists of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead F-10 ----- expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of revenues also includes inbound freight costs and costs to distribute products to customers. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) primarily consist of sales and marketing costs, corporate and divisional administrative and other costs and depreciation and amortization expense related to non-manufacturing assets. Advertising costs are charged to expense as incurred and were minimal in all periods presented. Research and Development Costs Our product development group focuses on research and development and product commercialization. The group includes chemical, packaging and field engineers who are responsible for developing and commercializing innovative label and application solutions. Technical service personnel also assist our product development group, customers and manufacturers in improving container and label performance. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

Cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our customers are primarily major consumer product, food & beverage, wine & spirits and container companies. Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities and are carried at sales value less allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history, age, account payment status compared to invoice payment terms and specific individual risks identified. Write-offs are recorded against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all reasonable efforts for collection have been exhausted. Inventories, Net Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value, and the majority is valued based on standard costs that approximate actual costs. The remainder of inventories are valued based on average actual costs. Standard costs are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year. The impact from annually resetting standards, as well as operating variances incurred throughout the year, are allocated to inventories and recognized in cost of revenues as product is sold. The Company adjusts inventory to its estimated net realizable value through a reserve that is an estimate of obsolete and slow-moving inventory, primarily based on the age of the inventory. F-11 ----- Property, Plant and Equipment, Net Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and include equipment under finance lease agreements. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases, is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or the remaining terms of the leases, whichever is shorter, as follows: Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20-39 years Building improvements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 years Machinery and equipment . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-15 years Computers . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-5 years Furniture and fixtures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-10 years Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets Assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the net assets acquired and is assigned to the reporting unit that acquires the business. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280, Segment Reporting, or a business one level below an operating segment if discrete financial information for that business is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. The Company conducts annual impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a reporting unit’s fair value may be less than its carrying value. If an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill may be impaired, it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value. If its carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that recorded goodwill exceeds the fair value of goodwill. Estimated fair values of the reporting unit are Level 3 measures and are developed under an income approach that discounts estimated future cash flows using risk-adjusted interest rates and also the market approach. _Intangible Assets. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over periods of up to_ 26 years based on a number of assumptions including estimated period of economic benefit and utilization. Intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets’ carrying values may be greater than their fair values. We test for impairment by comparing (i) estimates of undiscounted future cash flows, included in our operating plans to (ii) the carrying values of the related assets. Tests are performed over asset groups at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets We review long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired and the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Changes in market conditions and/or losses of a production line could have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations. The determination of whether impairment exists involves various estimates and assumptions, including the determination of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets involved in the review. The cash flow estimates are based upon our historical experience, adjusted to reflect estimated future market and operating conditions. Measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value. We base our estimates of fair values on quoted market prices when available, independent appraisals as appropriate and industry trends or other market knowledge. Tests are performed over asset groups at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. F-12 ----- Income Taxes The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable. Deferred income taxes are recognized at the enacted tax rates for the expected future tax consequences related to temporary differences between amounts reported for income tax purposes and financial reporting purposes as well as any tax attributes. Deferred income taxes are not provided for the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. that have been permanently reinvested in foreign operations. We regularly review our deferred income tax balances for each jurisdiction to estimate whether these deferred income tax balances are more likely than not to be realized based on the information currently available. Projected future taxable income is based on forecasted results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned. The timing of reversals of any existing temporary differences is based on our methods of accounting for income taxes and current tax legislation. Unless the deferred tax balances are more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying values of any deferred tax balances until circumstances indicate that realization becomes more likely than not. The Company establishes reserves for income tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether it is more likely than not that the tax uncertainty would be sustained upon challenge by the appropriate tax authorities. Provisions for and changes to these reserves and any related net interest and penalties are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Judgment is required when evaluating our tax provisions and determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly review our tax positions and we adjust the reserves as circumstances change. Fair Value Measurements The carrying value of financial instruments, which includes certain derivative contracts, approximates fair value. All of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on valuation models which project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign currency rates, futures and basis point spreads, as applicable. The carrying value approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments. The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, the Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs. The three levels are: Level 1 – Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 2 – Observable inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 3 – Unobservable inputs The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment. Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets impairment analyses, the valuation of acquired intangibles and in the valuation of assets held for sale. Goodwill and intangible assets are typically valued using Level 3 inputs. A change in those significant unobservable inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at the reporting date. F-13 ----- Foreign Exchange The functional currency of each of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally the currency of the country in which the subsidiary operates or the U.S. Dollar. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using period end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Translation gains (losses) are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) as a component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains (losses) are reported in other expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Translation and transaction gains (losses) were as follows: Translation gains (losses) . . . . . . . . . . . . **$44,881** $4,241 $(12) $(85) $(41) Transaction gains (losses) . . . . . . . . . . . . **(4,424)** (333) 51 14 (25) Debt Issuance Costs and Discounts Debt issuance costs and discounts are amortized into interest expense over the terms of the related loan agreements using the effective interest method or other methods which approximate the effective interest method. Debt issuance costs related to debt instruments other than lines of credit are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with discounts. Debt issuance costs related to lines of credit are presented as prepaid expenses and other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Commitments and Contingencies Certain conditions may exist as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, which may result in a loss to the Company but will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties, and other sources are recorded when the Company assesses that it is probable that a future liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Recoveries of costs from third parties, which the Company assesses as being probable of realization, are recorded to the extent of related contingent liabilities accrued. Legal costs incurred in connection with matters relating to contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. The Company records gain contingencies when realized. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” as amended. Topic 842 requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. We adopted Topic 842 on January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method which was applied to leases that existed or were entered into on or after January 1, 2020. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020, are presented under Topic 842, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting F-14 |Successor|Predecessor| |---|---| |Twelve Months Twelve Months Six Months February 6, Ended Ended Ended 2018 to December 31, December 31, December 31, June 30, 2020 2019 2018 2018 $44,881 $4,241 $(12) $(85) (4,424) (333) 51 14|July 1, 2017 to February 5, 2018| ||$(41) (25)| ----- treatment. Topic 842 provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition, and we have used certain of these practical expedients. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under Topic 842, which allows a lessee to carryforward their population of existing leases, the classification of each lease, as well as the treatment of initial direct costs as of the period of adoption. Finally, the Company elected the use-of-hindsight practical expedient, which permits a lessee to use hindsight in determining the lease term and assessing impairment. The adoption of Topic 842 resulted in recording ROU assets of $150,602 and lease liabilities of $155,441 as of January 1, 2020. The adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on the consolidated statements of operations or the consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 3 for the Company’s Topic 842 accounting disclosures and policy effective January 1, 2020. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Adoption of Topic 326, on January 1, 2020, required using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained deficit as of the effective date to align existing credit loss methodology with the new standard. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 is part of the FASB’s overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, “Income Taxes” in order to reduce the cost and complexity of its application in the areas of intraperiod tax allocation, deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences, year-to-date losses in interim periods and other areas within ASC 740. ASU 2019-12 is effective for non-public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, which for the Company would be January 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with any adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2019-12 on its consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Many of our lease agreements contain renewal options; however, we do not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for renewal periods unless it is determined that we are reasonably certain of renewing the lease at inception or when a triggering event occurs. Some of our lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses, free-rent periods, or other lease concessions that factored into the calculation of lease payments to the extent they are fixed and determinable at lease inception. Variable lease costs represent amounts that are not fixed in nature and are not tied to an index or rate and are recognized as incurred. Our variable lease costs are not material to the consolidated financial statements. F-15 ----- In determining our ROU assets and lease liabilities, we apply discount rates to the minimum lease payments within each lease agreement. When we cannot readily determine the discount rates implicit in the lease agreement, we utilize our fully collateralized incremental borrowing rates. To estimate our specific incremental borrowing rates, we consider, among other factors, interest rates on our existing credit facilities, risk-free rates, and the terms of the leases. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for all asset classes, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component. In addition, the Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, therefore, we did not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for these leases.

Prices for our products are based on agreed upon rates with customers and do not include financing components or noncash consideration. The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize is variable for certain customers and is impacted by incentives, including rebates, which are generally tied to achievement of certain sales volume levels. We recognize revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the product. Depending on the terms of the F-17 ----- agreement with the customer, we recognize revenue either at a point-in-time (at shipment or delivery depending on agreed upon terms) or over-time when the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations completed to date. Approximately 90% of our revenue is recognized at a point-in-time. Payment terms typically range from 30-90 days, based upon agreed upon terms with the customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that we collect from our customers that are both imposed on and concurrent with our revenue producing activities (such as sales tax, value-added tax, and excise taxes) are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control of the product is transferred to our customers are treated as fulfillment costs and not a separate performance obligation. For revenue recorded on an over-time basis the Company records contract assets when revenue is recognized but we have not yet invoiced the customer. This occurs when costs are incurred for the production of labels for over-time customers but the associated revenues have not been billed to the customer. Contract liabilities are recorded for arrangements where the Company has billed the customer but has not yet shipped the asset and fulfilled the performance obligation identified in the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

The transaction was valued at approximately $2,517,000 and included the purchase of all MCC outstanding shares, repayment of certain existing debt and issuance of new debt. Prior to the acquisition, MCC was a leading global provider of label solutions supporting a number of the world’s most prominent brands, including leading producers of home & personal care, wine & F-18 ----- spirits, food & beverage, healthcare, consumer durables and specialty products. MCC served international brand owners in the North American, South American, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions with a comprehensive range of the latest label technologies in Pressure Sensitive, Cut and Stack, In-Mold, Shrink Sleeve, Heat Transfer, Roll Fed and Aluminum Labels. The Company believes that the acquisition bolsters LABL’s already significant scale and end market, customer and product diversification, and that post-acquisition, LABL has become the largest pure-play label solutions provider, with the largest global market share in food & beverage, wine & spirits, and in-mold and the second largest global market share in home & personal care.

During the twelvemonths ended December 31, 2020, goodwill increased by $49,586 as a result of measurement period adjustments, which primarily consisted of a $85,000 decrease in the valuation of identifiable intangible assets, a $12,637 increase in the valuation of property, plant and equipment and a $28,720 decrease in the valuation of related deferred tax liabilities. In addition, during the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020, a $6,966 reduction of amortization expense and $3,224 increase in depreciation expense related to 2019 were recognized to reflect the effect of these purchase accounting adjustments as of the MCC acquisition date of July 1, 2019.

The fair value of the identifiable intangible assets has been estimated using the income approach through a discounted cash flow analysis. The cash flows are based on estimates used to price the MCC acquisition, and the discount rates applied were benchmarked with reference to the implied rate of return to the Company’s pricing model and weighted-average cost of capital (10.0% to 12.5%). The weighted-average amortization period for all identifiable intangible assets is 18.3 years in total. The goodwill for MCC is attributable to combining MCC’s global footprint with LABL’s strength in North America to enable LABL to become the largest pure-play label solutions provider, with the largest global market share in food & beverage, wine & spirits, and in-mold and the second largest global market share in home & personal care. Goodwill arising from the MCC acquisition is not deductible for income tax purposes. The Company spent $41,137 in acquisition expenses related to the MCC acquisition for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2019, which were recorded in transaction, integration and restructuring costs in the consolidated statements of operations. _Pro Forma Information (Unaudited)_ The following table provides the unaudited pro forma results of operations for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2019 as if MCC had been acquired as of the beginning of calendar year 2018.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed on October 31[st]. In the third quarter of 2020, an interim impairment assessment was performed on the Wine & Spirits (W&S), Food & Beverage (F&B), and Latin America Food & Beverage (LA F&B) reporting units F-21 ----- as a result of certain triggering events and changes in circumstances discussed in detail below. The impairment assessment consisted of determining each reporting unit’s current fair value compared to its current carrying value. Additionally, based on the macroeconomic factors below, the Company performed a qualitative review for all remaining reporting units and determined that those reporting units did not require an interim impairment assessment as it was more likely than not that the current fair value of those reporting units exceeded their carrying value, based on their current and projected financial performance. As it relates to the W&S, F&B, and LA F&B reporting units, an interim impairment assessment was triggered by recent macroeconomic conditions primarily driven by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which were not known or anticipated at the date of the MCC acquisition on July 1, 2019. Subsequent to the Company completing the acquisition of MCC on July 1, 2019, the Company has since revised its forecasts for all reporting units due to the deterioration in the overall global economy as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Company’s revised forecasts, which considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and additional uncertainty related to the achievement of previously anticipated annual revenue growth rates and corresponding profitability and cash flows, were utilized in the interim impairment assessment performed during the third quarter of 2020. In conjunction with our annual impairment tests as of October 31, 2020, the Company performed quantitative assessments for all six of our reporting units. When performing the interim and annual impairment assessments, the Company estimated the fair value of each of the aforementioned reporting units using a combination of: (i) a market approach based on multiples of revenues and earnings before interest depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) from recent comparable transactions and other market data; and (ii) an income approach based on expected future cash flows discounted at rates ranging between 9.00% to 12.75%. The discount rate reflects the risk associated with each respective reporting unit, including the industry and geographies in which they operate. The discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, the ability of the Company to achieve its most recent forecasts, and other factors not known at this time. These assumptions are typically not considered individually because assumptions used to select one variable should also be considered when selecting other variables; however, sensitivity of the overall fair value assessment to each significant variable was also considered. The market and income approaches were weighted evenly based on judgment of the comparability of the recent transactions and the risks inherent in estimating future cash flows. The Company considered recent economic and industry trends, as well as risk in executing current plans from the perspective of a hypothetical buyer in estimating expected future cash flows in the income approach. As a result of the change to expected future cash flows, along with comparable fair value information, when completing the interim and annual impairment assessments, the Company concluded that the carrying values for the F&B and LA F&B reporting units exceeded their fair values, resulting in a cumulative goodwill impairment charge of $39,874 during the twelve-months ended December 31, 2020, which was not deductible for income tax purposes. For the remaining reporting units, the impairment tests did not indicate impairment as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount. The Company is required to provide additional disclosures about fair value measurements as part of the consolidated financial statements for each major category of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (including impairment assessments). Goodwill is valued using F-22 ----- Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable by nature, and include internal estimates of future cash flows (income approach). Significant increases (decreases) in any of those unobservable inputs in isolation would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. The Company continues to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to assess the outlook for demand of its products and the impact on its business and financial performance. The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand, production levels, and its operating results in the short-term is uncertain, but the Company remains committed to the strategic actions necessary to realize long-term revenue and cash flow growth rates. The potential effect of negative demand on revenues is also uncertain given the volatile environment, but demand and production levels are anticipated to recover. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in the impairment testing for goodwill, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. While the Company can implement and has implemented certain strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans, forecasts, or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate each of the Company’s reporting unit fair values and could result in a further decline in fair value that would trigger a future material non-cash impairment charge of the reporting units’ goodwill balance in future periods.

The Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax code by, among other things, lowering U.S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a territorial tax system. The Tax Act reduced the corporate federal tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, which was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The Tax Act eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction and implements certain transitional impacts to the Company, including a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused the Company to adjust the U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21% on January 1, 2018. F-29 ----- The majority of the Company’s earnings from foreign subsidiaries are considered permanently reinvested. The repatriation tax resulted in certain previously untaxed non-U.S. earnings being included in the U.S. federal and state 2017 taxable income. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company analyzed its global working capital requirements and the potential tax liabilities that would be incurred if certain non-U.S. subsidiaries made distributions, which include local country withholding tax and potential U.S. state taxation. As of December 31, 2020, $1,565 of deferred tax was recorded for certain undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries. Historically, no deferred taxes have been provided for any portion of the remaining undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries since these earnings have been, and will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. For many reasons, including the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the Company’s legal entity structure, the complexity of tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions and the impact of projections of income for future years to any calculations, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon the distribution of earnings. Effective January 1, 2018, the Tax Act subjects a U.S. parent to current tax on its “global intangible low-taxed income” (“GILTI”). The Company did not anticipate incurring a GILTI liability in calendar year 2020, however, to the extent that expense is incurred under the GILTI provisions, in future periods, the Company will treat it as a component of income tax expense in the period incurred. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” and all related amendments, which provides revised guidance for revenue recognition. The standard was adopted by applying the modified retrospective method and all applicable deferred tax impacts were recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings on the date of adoption. On March 27, 2020, the President signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferral of employer social security tax payments, allows corporations with net operating losses generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to elect to carryback those losses for a period of five years and relaxes the limitation for business interest deductions from 30% to 50% for 2019 and 2020. The Company carried back the net operating losses generated during the full fiscal year December 31, 2019. As a result of the carryback, the Company recorded a benefit of $5,799 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The income taxes anticipated to be recovered as a result of the carryback will be at a federal tax rate of 35.0%, rather than the current federal statutory tax rate of 21.0%. Additionally, the valuation allowance recorded related to the limitation on the deductibility of interest was less due to the increase in the limitation from 30% to 50%.

F-35 ----- The Company sells to certain other third parties who are also owned by Platinum. These sales are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of the Company. On June 17, 2020, the Company entered into a Promissory Note of $6,769 (the “Note”) with a related party. The Note is recorded within other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The Note accrues interest annually at a fixed rate of 1.50% until the Note is paid in full.

At December 31, 2020, the Company had tax-effected state operating loss carryforwards of $6,798 which will expire between 2021 and 2040 and tax-effected foreign operating loss carryforwards of $29,910 which include losses of $19,883 with no expiration date and the remainder will expire between 2021 and 2040. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had valuation allowances of $44,997 and $26,637, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $25,355 and $26,161, respectively, of the valuation allowances are related to certain deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions due to the uncertainty of the realization of future tax benefits from those assets. The increase in the valuation allowance during the year is primarily caused by an increase in certain U.S. federal and State interest carryforwards which are not more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. At each reporting date, the Company considers both negative and positive evidence that impacts the assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets. The benefits of tax positions are not recorded unless it is more likely than not the tax position would be sustained upon challenge by the appropriate tax authorities. Tax benefits that are more likely than not to be sustained are measured at the largest amount of benefit that is cumulatively greater than a 50% likelihood of being realized. F-31 ----- As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company had liabilities of $7,937 and $5,966, respectively, recorded for unrecognized tax benefits for U.S. federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $1,427 and income tax benefit of $95, respectively, for interest and penalties in the consolidated statements of operations. The liability for the gross amount of interest and penalties at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3,092 and $1,480, respectively. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified in other noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets for the portion of the liability where payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the consolidated balance sheet date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company released $795 of reserves, related to uncertain tax positions for which the statutes of limitations have lapsed or there was a reduction in the tax position related to a prior year. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that $1,024 of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 could be released within the next 12 months due to lapse of statute of limitations and settlements of certain foreign and domestic income tax matters. The unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate are $10,440. A summary of the activity for the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

These costs included $4,648 in non-cash fixed asset impairment charges primarily related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Franklin, PA, Heath, OH, Wilton, NH and one of our facilities in Monterrey, Mexico. As a result of our decision to close these manufacturing facilities, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at these facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their estimated useful lives. The land and building at the Franklin, PA facility were written-down to their estimated fair values, less costs to sell, of $1,504, which were determined based on a third party valuation utilizing prices for similar assets (a Level 2 measurement) and recorded in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining impairment charges relate to fixed assets that were or are anticipated to be scrapped or abandoned upon closure of the related facility; therefore, the net book value of these fixed assets was written-off. In addition, facility closure expenses included $3,177 in severance and other termination benefits, primarily related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Franklin, PA, Heath, OH, Wilton, NH and one of our facilities in Monterrey, Mexico.

LABL serves national and international brand owners in the North American, Latin American, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific regions with a comprehensive range of the latest label technologies in Pressure Sensitive, Cut and Stack, In-Mold, Shrink Sleeve, Heat Transfer, Roll Fed, and Aluminum Labels. In addition, LABL provides other value-added packaging solutions including printed cartons and other packaging products. LABL owns 60% of its foreign subsidiary, W/S Packaging Mexico, S.A. de C.V. The acquisition of Multi-Color Corporation on July 1, 2019 included a 75% controlling interest in the label operations of Spearsystem Packaging (Africa) Proprietary Limited. The remaining 25% interest of Spearsystem Packaging (Africa) Proprietary Limited was acquired during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and LABL owns 100% of the entity as of June 30, 2021. The ownership interest of W/S Packaging Mexico, S.A. de C.V. not held by LABL is presented in “non-controlling interests” in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. Basis of Presentation The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). Although certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. A description of the Company’s significant accounting policies is included in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the December 31, 2020 audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The information furnished in these condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all estimates and adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the results for the interim periods reported. Results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ended December 31, 2021. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period balances in the condensed consolidated statements of operations have been reclassified to conform to current year classifications. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s operations were conducted through the Consumer Product Goods, Wine & Spirits and Food & Beverage operating segments, which are aggregated into one reportable segment in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 280, “Segment Reporting.” The metrics used by management to F-45 ----- assess the performance of the Company’s operating segments include revenue trends, gross profit margin and operating margin. The Company’s operating segments have historically had similar economic characteristics and are expected to have similar economic characteristics and long-term financial performance in future periods. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and such associated measures on management’s estimates and results of operations through June 30, 2021 are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Events and changes in circumstances arising after June 30, 2021, including those resulting from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be reflected in management’s estimates in future periods, as necessary. Use of Estimates in Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions due to among other reasons, the continued uncertainty of general economic conditions due to the COVID-19 global pandemic that has impacted, and may continue to impact, our sales channels, supply chain, manufacturing operations, workforce, or other key aspects of our operations. Fair Value Measurements The Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements, the Company uses a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the use of observable inputs. The three levels are: Level 1—Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 3—Unobservable inputs The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment. The carrying value of financial instruments, which includes certain derivative contracts, approximates fair value. All of the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities are measured at fair value and are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on valuation models which project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign currency rates, futures and basis point spreads, as applicable. The carrying value approximates fair value for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments. Fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities are primarily used in business combinations, goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets impairment analyses, the valuation of acquired intangibles and the valuation of assets held for sale and are typically valued using Level 3 inputs. A change in those significant unobservable inputs to a different amount might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement at the reporting date. F-46 ----- Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our customers are primarily major consumer product, food & beverage, wine & spirits and container companies. Accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers in connection with our normal business activities and are carried at sales value less allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is established to reflect the expected losses of accounts receivable based on past collection history, age, account payment status compared to invoice payment terms and specific individual risks identified. Write-offs are recorded against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all reasonable efforts for collection have been exhausted. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.” ASU 2019-12 is part of the FASB’s overall simplification initiative to reduce costs and complexity of applying accounting standards while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, “Income Taxes,” in order to reduce the cost and complexity of its application in the areas of intraperiod tax allocation, deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences, year-to-date losses in interim periods and other areas within ASC 740. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1, 2021, the adoption of ASU 2019-12 did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. No other new accounting pronouncement recently issued or newly effective had or is expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are classified as operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Many of our lease agreements contain renewal options; however, we do not recognize right-of-use (“ROU”) assets or lease liabilities for renewal periods unless it is determined that we are reasonably certain of renewing the lease at inception or when a triggering event occurs. Some of our lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses, free-rent periods, or other lease concessions that factored into the calculation of lease payments to the extent they are fixed and determinable at lease inception. Variable lease costs represent amounts that are not fixed in nature and are not tied to an index or rate and are recognized as incurred. Our variable lease costs are not material to the condensed consolidated financial statements. In determining our ROU assets and lease liabilities, we apply discount rates to the minimum lease payments within each lease agreement. When we cannot readily determine the discount rates implicit in the lease agreement, we utilize our fully collateralized incremental borrowing rates. To estimate our specific incremental borrowing rates, we consider, among other factors, interest rates on our existing credit facilities, risk-free rates, and the terms of the leases. The Company also elected the practical expedient related to lease and non-lease components, as an accounting policy election for all asset classes, which allows a lessee to not separate non-lease from lease components and instead account for consideration paid in a contract as a single lease component. In addition, the Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases with a term of 12 months or less, therefore, we did not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for these leases.

Revenue is recorded in an amount that reflects the net consideration that we expect to receive. Prices for our products are based on agreed upon rates with customers and do not include financing components or noncash consideration. The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize is variable for certain customers and is impacted by incentives, including rebates, which are generally tied to achievement of certain sales volume levels. We recognize revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the product. The performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. Depending on the terms of the agreement with the customer, we recognize revenue either at a point-in-time (at shipment or delivery depending on agreed upon terms) or over-time when the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance obligations completed to date. Payment terms typically range from 30-90 days, based on agreed upon terms with the customer. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that we collect from our customers that are both imposed on and concurrent with our revenue producing activities (such as sales tax, value-added tax, and excise taxes) are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control of the product is transferred to our customers are treated as fulfillment costs and not a separate performance obligation. For revenue recorded on an over-time basis the Company records contract assets when revenue is recognized but we have not yet invoiced the customer. This occurs when costs are incurred for the production of labels for over-time customers but the associated revenues have not been billed to the customer. Contract liabilities are recorded for arrangements where the Company has billed the customer but has not yet shipped the asset and fulfilled the performance obligation identified in the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

During the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $4,856 and $5,861 in facility closure expenses in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The current year costs primarily consisted of costs related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Franklin, PA, Heath, OH, Wilton, NH, Fulton, KY, Vittel, France, one of our facilities in Monterrey, Mexico, the former Tyson Print Shop business located in Springdale, AR and the merger of our facilities in Rawang, Balakong and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia into one facility. These costs consist of costs to dismantle, transport and reassemble manufacturing equipment that was moved to other facilities, costs to maintain facilities until the building is sold or lease terminated and additional costs incurred as a result of the plant closure. The prior year costs primarily consisted of non-cash fixed asset impairment charges related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Franklin, PA, Heath, OH and Rochester, NY of $3,616 and $3,668, which were recorded during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. As a result of our decision to close these manufacturing facilities, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that certain fixed assets at these facilities would be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of their estimated useful lives. The land and building at the Franklin, PA facility were written down to their estimated fair values, less costs to sell, of $1,504, which were determined based on a third-party valuation (a Level 2 measurement). The remaining impairment charges related to fixed assets that were scrapped or abandoned upon closure of the related facility; therefore, the net book values of these fixed assets were written-off. The remaining facility closure costs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, primarily consisted of severance and other termination benefits related to the closure of our manufacturing facilities in Franklin, PA, Heath, OH and Rochester, NY.",N/A,as_expected,2021,539

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditors’ judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. KPMG LLP, a Delaware limited liability partnership and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee. F-60 ----- We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. _Opinion_ In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fort Dearborn Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. _Emphasis of Matter_ As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2019, the Company adopted new accounting guidance ASU 2014-09 (Topic 606): Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

The Company writes off trade accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had an allowance for doubtful accounts of $3,660 and $1,368, respectively. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 severity, insurance retention levels, the number of incurred but not reported claims, and other factors can materially affect the estimates for these liabilities. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 On March 27, 2020 and December 27, 2020, the President of the United States signed and enacted into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (CAA). Among other provisions, the CARES Act and the CAA provide relief to U.S. federal corporate taxpayers through temporary adjustments to net operating loss rules, changes to limitations on interest expense deductibility, and the acceleration of available refunds for minimum tax credit carryforwards. The CARES Act and the CAA did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 application on January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. The Company sells products that do not have an alternative use, and, under Topic 606, revenue associated with these products is required to be recognized earlier than under prior revenue recognition standards if there is enforceable right to payment in contract. Utilizing the cumulative effect method, the cumulative impact of adopting the new standard resulted in an increase of approximately $1,297 to net sales, $26,603 to receivable, $534 to cost of sales, $352 to accrued expenses and decrease of approximately $14,869 to inventories for the year ended 2019, and $8,117 to opening retained deficit as of January 1, 2019. For the year ending December 31, 2020, the result of adopting Topic 606 was a decrease of approximately $599 to net sales and accounts receivable and a decrease of $905 to cost of sales and increase to inventory, and $150 decrease to accrued expenses as compared with what would have been recognized under Topic 605. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Our revenue earning activities primarily involve manufacturing products customized for the customer. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized using a five-step model consisting of the following: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue for its products when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer are satisfied at a point in time. Revenue is recognized when the product is shipped from our manufacturing facility to our customer. Certain customers may receive volume-based incentives, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenue recognized. Certain customers receive a portion of their products as consigned inventories with revenue recognized once the customer uses or consumes the products. Some contracts with customers contain enforceable right of payment terms that include a reasonable profit throughout the duration of the contract for manufacturing of products that do not have an alternative use, which trigger recognition of revenue over time. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services upon completion of manufacturing, including the expected value of variable consideration, based on the completion percentage of products as of the year end. For all sales with an enforceable right to payment and where the products sold have no alternative use, revenue is recognized over time.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company elected to withdraw from both of its U.S. multiemployer pension plans, the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Pension Fund (GCC IBTNPF), and the Graphic Arts Industry Joint Pension Fund (GAIJPF). As a result, the Company recorded a withdrawal liability calculated from its average contributions over the most recent five years compared to the total contributions to the fund from all employers over the same time period, multiplied by the current unfunded liability. The annual payments required for the GCC IBTNPF and GAIJPF are $345 and $48, respectively, for 20 years. Using a discount rate of 7%, the Company has estimated withdrawal liabilities for the GCC IBTNPF and GAIJPF of $2,868 and $401, respectively as of December 31, 2020. The Company had estimated withdrawal liabilities for the GCC IBTNPF and GAIJPF of $3,007 and $420, respectively as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. As part of the AC Label, LLC acquisition in 2013, the Company assumed a pension withdrawal obligation for a U.S. multiemployer pension plan, the GCC IBTNPF. As a result, the Company recorded a withdrawal liability in purchase accounting that requires annual payments of $128 for 20 years. Using a discount rate of 7%, the Company has estimated withdrawal liabilities for the GCC IBTNPF of $1,062 and $1,114, respectively as of December 31, 2020. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 to benefit the Company by creating increased incentives to attract, motivate and aid in the retention of employees who will contribute to the growth and profitability of the organization. The Plan provides long term incentive compensation to the Company’s officers and certain key employees. One half of the granted Incentive Units vest upon the passage of time over five years at a rate of 20% upon each of the first five anniversaries of the original grant date, or upon a change in control. The other half of the granted Incentive Units vest upon the achievement of a predefined return on invested capital achieved by the initial investors. No compensation expense was recognized in 2020 and 2019 from these Units due to the inherent uncertainty in the conditions required to realize such a return as of the financial statement date. The grant date value of all granted Incentive Units was determined by an independent valuation specialist utilizing a Black-Scholes Option Valuation model. Since the Company’s shares are not publicly traded, expected volatility (50%) is estimated based on the average historical volatility of similar entities with publicly traded shares. The risk-free rate of return is based on 5-year U.S. Treasury note yields. Total compensation expense related to the incentive plans was $628 and $866, respectively in 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unrecorded compensation cost for the unit awards was $1,338 and $1,744, respectively, and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for each grant which ranges between 2021 and 2023. These awards are considered equity-based awards and are therefore classified as a component of additional paid-in capital.

(2) **Business Combinations _Oak Printing Company_ On February 2, 2020 the Company purchased the majority of the assets of Oak Printing Company (“seller”), a producer of printed labels principally for the food, beverage, and household product industries for $5,000 thousand in cash. Oak Printing operated one facility located in Strongsville, OH. The acquisition was partially financed via the company’s Revolving Line of Credit. Subsequent to closing, the seller paid the Company a $23 thousand working capital adjustment in accordance with the agreement. The purchase accounting was finalized as of November 30, 2020. The components of the consideration transferred and the amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for each major class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows (in thousands): utilizes innovative technological solutions through its robust research and development resources. Hammer operates two production facilities located in West Henrietta, NY and Rochester, NY. Total cash paid at acquisition was $100,484 thousand ($101,000 thousand base purchase price). The Hammer transaction is subject to customary representations and warranties, holdbacks, and net working capital adjustment. The acquisition of Hammer was funded through the issuance of new term debt of $90,000 thousand (see note 7) and a capital contribution of $20,000 thousand from the Company’s shareholder. _Preliminary Purchase Consideration Allocation_ The Hammer transaction is accounted for under the acquisition method, which requires the Company to perform an allocation of the preliminary purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the preliminary purchase consideration over the estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill. The following table summarizes the Company’s preliminary allocation of the preliminary purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Hammer transaction closing date (in thousands): the loan to Hammer under the PPP was forgiven by the lender. The Company did not recognize any gain on extinguishment of this debt, as the seller of Hammer had agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to any portion of this loan which was not forgiven. The Company has excluded the assumed debt as part of purchase consideration allocation. The identifiable intangible assets include Hammer customer relationships of $28,000 thousand and its trademark of $1,800 thousand and have been estimated based on a preliminary valuation and will be amortized over the estimated useful lives of 12 and 0.8 years, respectively. The Company also recognized a preliminary deferred tax liability of $10,977 thousand associated with the transaction, resulting in an increase in goodwill equal to that amount. Preliminary goodwill recognized from the Hammer acquisition is estimated to be attributable, but not limited to, the acquired workforce and expected synergies with the Company. The tax basis of the acquired intangibles and goodwill will not be deductible for income tax purposes. (3) **Inventories Inventories consisted of the following (in thousands): amount of impairment recorded, if necessary, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. There have been no impairments recorded for periods ending June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. (5) **Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets The following is a summary of intangibles (in thousands): (7) **Revolving Line of Credit and Long-Term Debt On October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a secured credit facility that provides the company and its subsidiaries with a First and Second Lien loan and revolving line of credit that, when taken together, are referred to as the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of the company’s assets including inventory and fixed assets. (a) **_Long-Term Debt Long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands): acquisitions, sell assets and make restricted payments. The credit facilities do not include any ongoing requirements that the Company maintain specific financial performance covenants. If utilization of the revolving credit facility exceeds 35% of the $75,000 thousand commitments, the Company is required to maintain the ratio of Consolidated First Lien debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) to less than 7.25:1. FDC, Inc. was in compliance with these covenants for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. The first lien credit facility requires quarterly payments of principal totaling $1,320 thousand that commenced in March 2017 with the balance due in 2023. Required principal payments are adjusted as additional loan borrowings are made. The second lien credit facility does not have scheduled quarterly principal repayments and comes due in 2024. In addition, FDC, Inc. is required annually to pay a percentage of Excess Cash Flow (as defined by the agreements). The percentage of Excess Cash Flow required to be remitted ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the company’s first lien leverage ratio. FDC, Inc. was not required to make an Excess Cash Flow payment for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 and the year ended December 31, 2020. (8) **Leases (a) **_Operating Leases The Company leases buildings, machinery and equipment, and computer and office equipment under operating leases expiring in various years through 2032. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the operating lease. Rental expense incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 was $4,057 thousand and $3,304 thousand, respectively. Certain operating leases provide for renewal options for periods from one month to one year at their current rental value. In the normal course of business, operating leases are generally renewed or replaced by other leases. The following is a schedule by years of future minimum lease payments classified as capital leases with the present value of the net minimum lease payments as of June 30, 2021 (in thousands): approximately 9.4% and 8.5%, respectively, of the Company’s total revenues. Accounts receivable balances (in thousands) from this customer were $9,849 thousand and $10,470 thousand, respectively, as of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. (b) **_Commitments and Contingencies From time to time, the Company is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that there are currently no legal matters that would have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The Company maintains insurance coverage against claims in an amount believed to be adequate. (11) Stock Option Plan Total compensation expense related to the incentive plans was $336 thousand during the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 the unrecorded compensation cost for the unit awards was $1,183 thousand and $1,338 thousand, respectively, and will be recognized over the remaining vesting period for each grant which ranges between 2021 and 2025. These awards are considered equity-based awards and are therefore classified as a component of additional paid-in capital. (12) Related-Party Transactions The Company reimburses Advent International, the Company’s sole shareholder, for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the business. Total reimbursable expenses paid to Advent International were $55 thousand and $138 thousand, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. These amounts are included in administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On March 1, 2021, Advent International contributed $20,000 thousand as equity financing for the Hammer acquisition (see note 2). From time to time the Company may enter into commercial agreements with subsidiary portfolio companies of Advent International. During the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 revenue associated with these agreements were approximately $1,204 thousand and $1,203 thousand, respectively. (13) Subsequent Events On July 1, 2021, Fortress Parent, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and the parent of FDC, Inc., entered into a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate (“Buyer”) of investment management firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”) whereby the Company and its affiliates would be acquired and will become an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer upon closing of the transaction (the “Proposed Transaction”). The Proposed Transaction is expected to be consummated in late 2021, subject to customary closing conditions, as well as the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

As of June 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $30,265 thousand and $63,515 thousand available on this credit line, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, the Company had $42,550 thousand drawn borrowings and $2,185 thousand letters of credit outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $9,400 thousand drawn borrowings and $2,085 thousand letters of credit outstanding. The letters of credit support the Company’s self-insured workers compensation program. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit bear interest at the prime rate plus a borrowing margin. Given the Company’s ability to re borrow, any outstanding amounts are classified as long-term debt. Commitments on the revolving credit facility expire on July 20, 2023. (c) **_Term Debt Facilities FDC Inc. has a $593,803 thousand first lien term loan credit facility and a $145,000 thousand second lien term loan credit facility. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, the first lien term loan was increased by $90,000 thousand, via amendments to the first lien credit agreement to fund the Hammer Packaging Corporation. Borrowings for term loans under these credit facilities bear interest that is calculated based on either the prime rate or London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a borrowing margin.

(9) **Income Taxes The Company is taxed as a corporation for income tax purposes and is subject to federal, state, and local taxes. Additionally, certain wholly owned entities taxed as corporations are subject to federal, state, and foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, and accruals for such taxes are included in the consolidated financial statements. For the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the Company has utilized the discrete effective tax rate method, as allowed by ASC 740-270-30-18, “Income Taxes—Interim Reporting,” to calculate its interim income tax provision. The discrete method is applied when the application of the estimated annual effective tax rate is impractical because it is not possible to reliably estimate the annual effective tax rate. The discrete method treats the year-to-date period as if it was the annual period and determines the income tax expense or benefit on that basis. The Company believes that, at this time, the use of the discrete method is more appropriate than the annual effective tax rate method because small changes in the projected ordinary annual income would result in significant changes in the estimated annual effective rate. Our effective tax rate was 9.4% and 4.5% for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate differed from the federal and state statutory rates primarily due to permanent income tax differences related to goodwill amortization, certain recurring permanent tax differences, and differences in allocable income for the Company’s state tax filings.
