We caution readers not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein, to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, or any other change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Where, in any forward-looking statement, the Group expresses an expectation or belief as to future results or events, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis, but there can be no assurance that the expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forwardlooking statements included in this Offering Memorandum include those described under “Risk Factors”. The following are some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from anticipated results or events: - our substantial leverage and debt service obligations; - our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to control and finance our capital expenditures and operations; - restrictions and limitations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness; - our ability to raise additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness; - fluctuations in currency exchange rates, inflation and interest rates; - negative changes to our credit rating; - risks associated with our structure, this offering, and our other indebtedness; - the competitive environment and downward price pressure in the broadband internet communications, television sector, fixed line telephony, mobile telephony and B2B sectors in France or in countries in which we may operate in the future; - economic and business conditions and trends in the industries in which we and the entities in which we have interests operate; - changes in the political, judicial, economic or security environment in France or in countries in which we may operate in the future; ----- - changes in consumer demand for cable-based, mobile and media products as well as the demand for bundled services and offerings; - development of telecommunications networks and services and dependence on third-parties for access to certain parts of our network; - our ability to introduce new technologies or services and our ability to respond to technological developments; - deployment of fiber and/or VDSL2 networks and/or new generation mobile networks by our competitors; - perceived or actual health risks and other environmental requirements relating to our mobile operations; - our ability to maintain favorable roaming or network sharing agreements; - our ability to achieve cost savings from network sharing agreements for our mobile services; - the ability of telecommunications providers to provide consistent services without disruption; - the ability of third party suppliers and vendors to timely deliver products, network infrastructure, equipment, software and services; - the availability of attractive content for our digital video services or necessary equipment at reasonable costs; - risks related to royalties payments and our licenses; - technical failures, equipment defects, physical or electronic break-ins to the services, computer viruses and similar description problems; - any negative impact on our reputation, including due to product quality issues; - customer churn; - our ability to integrate acquired businesses and realize planned synergy benefits from past or future acquisitions; - our ability to maintain adequate managerial controls and procedures as the business grows; - our inability to provide high levels of customer service; - the declining revenue from certain of our services and our ability to offset such declines; - any disruptions in the credit and equity markets which could affect our credit instruments and cash investments; - our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and avoid any infringement of any third party’s intellectual property rights; - our ability to maintain subscriber data and comply with data privacy laws; - the outcome of any pending legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings; - our significant post retirement and healthcare benefit obligations (both funded and unfunded); - changes in laws or treaties relating to taxation in the countries in which we operate, or the interpretation thereof; ----- - the regulatory environment in France or in countries in which we may operate in the future and changes in, or a failure or an inability to comply with, government regulations and adverse outcomes from regulatory proceedings; - local business risks in the jurisdictions in which we operate; - our ability to manage our brands; - our inability to completely control the prices we charge to customers or the programming we provide; - our ability to obtain building and environmental permits for the building and upgrading of our networks and to comply generally with city planning laws; - the loss of key employees and the availability of qualified personnel and a deterioration of the relationship with employee representatives; - our ultimate parent’s interests, which may conflict with our interests; - the impact from the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic; - events that are outside of our control, such as political unrest in international markets, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, pandemics and other similar events; and - other factors described in more detail under “Risk Factors”. The cable television, broadband internet access, fixed line telephony, mobile services, ISP services, business services and wholesale industries are changing rapidly and, therefore, the forward-looking statements of expectations, plans and intent in this Offering Memorandum are subject to a significant degree of risk. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Offering Memorandum. The Group discloses important factors that could cause the Group’s actual results to differ materially from its expectations in this Offering Memorandum.

This list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive, and should be read in conjunction with other factors that are included in this Offering Memorandum.

All forwardlooking statements should be evaluated in light of their inherent uncertainty. The Group operates in a competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks, uncertainties and other factors may emerge that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Except as required by law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange on which its securities are listed, we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertakings to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Offering Memorandum to reflect any change in its expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any forwardlooking statement contained in this Offering Memorandum is based. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,120,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION,120.6,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,120.6.2,,"This Offering Memorandum contains measures and ratios (the “Non-IFRS Measures”), including Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA less accrued capital expenditures (also referred to as “operating free cash flow” in the Historical Consolidated Financial Information) and accrued capital expenditures, that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting standards. We present Non-IFRS Measures because we believe that they are of interest to the investors and similar measures are widely used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of performance and liquidity. The Non-IFRS Measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, operating results as reported under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting standards. The Non-IFRS Measures may also be defined differently than the corresponding terms governing our indebtedness, including the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement or the Existing Term Loans Agreement (each as defined herein). Non-IFRS Measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA less accrued capital expenditures (also referred to as “operating free cash flow” in the Historical Consolidated Financial Information), are not measurements of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, performance or liquidity under IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles. In particular, you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less accrued capital expenditures (also referred to as “operating free cash flow” in the Historical Consolidated Financial Information) as an alternative to (i) operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS) or as a measure of our, or any of our operating entities’, operating performance, (ii) cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of our, or any of our subsidiaries’, ability to meet our cash needs or (iii) any other measures of performance under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting standards. Adjusted EBITDA, _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less accrued capital expenditures (also referred to as “operating free cash flow” in the Historical Consolidated Financial Information) have certain limitations as analytical tools, including but not limited to: - they do not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments; - although depreciation, amortization and impairment are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will generally need to be replaced in the future; - Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less accrued capital expenditures do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - some of the non-recurring items that we or our operating entities eliminate in calculating Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA less accrued capital expenditures reflect cash payments that were made, or will in the future be made. In addition, as a result of certain acquisitions and disposals that have been consummated by the Group during the periods presented in this Offering Memorandum, and the intra-year timing of such acquisitions and disposals, the comparability of the Historical Consolidated Financial Information over each of such periods may be limited. Pro _forma financial information has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X under_ ----- the U.S. Securities Act, the Prospectus Regulation, IFRS or any generally accepted accounting standards. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Discussion and _Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017—Significant Events Affecting_ Historical Results”_ and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results” for more_ information. Unless otherwise specified, the Historical Consolidated Financial Information does not give _pro _forma effect to the acquisitions and disposals that have been consummated by the Group during the periods_ presented in this Offering Memorandum, or to any acquisitions and disposals occurring after June 30, 2020, and may therefore differ from the financial information relating to the Group publicly reported by Altice Europe (as defined herein) and its consolidated subsidiaries for the same periods which does give pro forma effect to certain of such acquisitions and disposals.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,The Group,9.1.1,Residential - Mobile,"We are the second-largest operator of mobile telephony in France by number of subscribers, with approximately 15,877,000 residential mobile subscribers as of June 30, 2020. We believe that we are also the leader in terms of 4G mobile antennas in service in France with 46,176 antennas as of June 30, 2020. Due to our strong market position in the mobile telephony market, we are one of the primary convergence operators in France with an attractive “4P” offer (consisting of pay-TV products, broadband internet, fixed telephony and mobile services). We accelerated the build-out of our 4G network over the last two years to have a market-leading mobile network (with a 4G population coverage of 99% as of June 30, 2020). We are already preparing for the introduction of the next generation of mobile telephony with 5G technology. After the first tests carried out in 2016 and 2017, we conducted further tests in different cities in France in 2019, and we, with one of our partners, Nokia, were the first in France to make a 5G New Radio connection using the 3.5 GHz frequency band in 2018. In 2020, the French Government initiated the 5G spectrum auction and the process for such auction includes (i) the allocation of four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each) at a price of €350 million each to qualifying operators; and (ii) a competitive auction process for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz. We have qualified and will be able to obtain five blocks of 10 MHz each. In addition, we intend to bid in the competitive auction for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz each. The allocation of the 11 blocks of 10MHz is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. In December 2018, we completed the Towers Transaction through which we monetized the value of our passive mobile infrastructure assets. Hivory, the tower company in which we own a 50.01% interest, is a high-quality telecommunications infrastructure provider with a nationwide presence. It is the largest independent telecommunications tower company in France and the third largest European tower company, benefiting from ----- more than 10,000 strategically located sites with a diversified portfolio of ground-based towers and rooftops. Through Hivory, we and our joint venture partner, KKR, seek to proactively partner with third party mobile operators to develop their coverage and densification objectives, including through the build-to-suit of 1,200 new sites by 2022. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Hivory” for more information. In the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, our mobile residential activity (excluding equipment) generated €1,767 million and €1,748 million of revenue, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,The Group,9.1.2,Residential - Fixed,"As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately 6,401,000 total residential fixed unique customers and our fiber/cable network passed approximately 17,457,000 homes. Over the past four years, we have increased our fiber/cable deployment and upgraded a substantial part of our fiber/cable networks. For example, as of June 30, 2020, our fiber/cable networks are largely DOCSIS 3.0 enabled, which allows us to offer customers high broadband internet access speeds and better HDTV services across our footprint. We believe that we are also France’s leading fiber/cable provider, with approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes passed as of June 30, 2020, including fiber/cable homes passed by SFR FTTH. We intend to continue the expansion of our fiber network in France through engagement with local communities and government and capitalize on our past investments in improved fiber/cable infrastructure. Moreover, SFR FTTH plans to expand its network in low density areas with more than 5.6 million homes expected to be passed by 2023 (including 2.5 million homes passed as of June 30, 2020), which will be further supplemented following the combination of Covage and SFR FTTH with approximately 2.4 million homes expected to be passed (including 0.9 million homes already built and 0.3 million homes in very dense areas). We are able to upsell our existing DSL subscribers with fiber/cable broadband offers due to the overlapping fiber/cable and DSL networks and, moreover, the natural churn rate of broadband subscribers draws existing DSL subscribers to our cable and fiber products. This shift of subscribers from DSL has allowed, and is expected to continue to allow, us to reallocate investment expenses previously earmarked for DSL infrastructure to accelerating the rollout of our fiber/cable network. In the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, our residential fixed activity generated €1,274 million and €1,245 million of revenue, respectively.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

We offer data services, including IP VPN services (virtual private network on IP), LAN to LAN (local network), internet, security services, hosting and “cloud computing” and voice services, in particular voice call services, VoIP and Centrex. We are the largest national alternative wholesale services player to the incumbent provider by revenues and number of subscribers. We offer a broad portfolio of wholesale products across the entire spectrum of the wholesale market including wholesale connectivity services for fixed-line and mobile voice calls, wholesale connectivity services for data, wholesale fiber infrastructure services as well as triple-play DSL white label packages and very-high-speed offers to a significant base of local, virtual, national and international operators. In addition, Hivory plans to utilize its passive mobile infrastructure to provide hosting, site development and ancillary services to operators in France, including the Group. Moreover, the combination of Covage and SFR FTTH will create a robust FTTH wholesale provider in Europe.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,The Group,9.1.5,Media,"In furtherance of our convergence strategy, we are focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement our fixed and mobile services, including producing proprietary content. This strategy is evidenced by our investment in NextRadioTV S.A. (“NextRadio TV”), through which the Group produces high quality television channels such as BFM TV and RMC Sport. In addition, we are focused on supplementing our own content offerings with premium content produced by third parties, including high quality local content and exclusive premium content. Altice Europe and the Group have recently reorganized the corporate organizational structure relating to premium sports content activities and we now hold the rights to broadcast and/or distribute various premium sporting events through our Unrestricted Subsidiary SportCoTV (which was previously held by a subsidiary of Altice Europe outside the Group), including the French Athletics Federation, English Premier League (through an agreement with Canal+), French Basketball League, English Rugby Premiership, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europe League, which are commercialized in France via exclusive SFR branded channels. See “—Recent Developments—Transfer of sports _rights” for more information. In July 2020, we entered into certain arrangements with Mediapro which further_ enhances our offering of premium sports content to our subscribers, by allowing us to broadcast Mediapro’s channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2). The arrangements with Mediapro are subject to UEFA approval. See “Business of the Group—Media” for more information. In order to accommodate the Mediapro arrangements, we are currently in the process of finalizing an amended distribution agreement with SportCoTV, which will be on an arm’s length basis, pursuant to which the Group will broadcast premium sports content. The distribution agreement will provide for, inter alia, a minimum guarantee amount payable by the Group to SportCoTV and a revenue share mechanism over and above such minimum guarantee amount. We also launched a single brand in July 2018 for all of our sports content: RMC Sport, which replaced the SFR Sport channel. At the end of 2016, Altice Europe and the Group also announced strategic agreements with NBCUniversal International and Discovery which confer certain exclusive distribution rights in France. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to enrich our differentiated and convergent communication services from those of our competitors. In the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, our media activity (which comprises revenues generated by the proprietary content produced by us, as described above) generated €158 million and €233 million of revenue, respectively. Media business revenues were significantly impacted by the loss of advertising revenues as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in March, after a strong start to the year in January and February. See “—Recent _Developments—COVID-19 Pandemic”. Media business revenues were also impacted by the disposal of the_ L’express magazine in July 2019 (as revenues of L’express were included for the six months ended June 30, 2019).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

We believe we are the leader in terms of 4G mobile antennas in service in France, with 46,176 antennas and covering 99% of the population with 4G, as of June 30, 2020. The Group has a state-of-theart fiber/cable infrastructure, consisting of 80,000 km of fiber optic cable and more than 165 metropolitan loops as of June 30, 2020, passing approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes as of June 30, 2020, including fiber/cable homes passed by SFR FTTH, an associate in which we own a 50.01% interest (with the remaining held by the JV Consortium), which we believe is the largest alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator in France. We track the performance of our business and further analyze our revenues by activity, which, with effect from January 1, 2019, includes “residential – mobile,” “residential – fixed,” “business services,” “equipment sales,” and “media”.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,We are a leading alternative operator with strong market positions in all segments of an attractive telecommunications market.,"France is the third largest telecommunications market in Europe, with revenues of approximately €35.2 billion for the twelve months ended March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). We have a significant market share across all main segments of the French telecommunications market, acting as the main competitor of the incumbent operator, and ----- are a leading alternative telecommunications operator in Europe. Despite growth in market size, the French telecommunications market has recently declined in value primarily due to price pressure in the mobile market following the arrival of a fourth player in 2012 and the decline in regulated call termination rates. The Group, however, believes that it is the largest operator in the fiber/cable market, with approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes passed as of June 30, 2020, including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH. We are also the second largest mobile telephony operator in France, with approximately 15,877,000 residential mobile subscribers as of June 30, 2020, and a leading operator in the wholesale telephony segment due to our significant wholesale capabilities in the fiber sector. _Mobile. We are the second largest mobile telephony operator in France, with approximately 15,877,000 residential_ mobile subscribers as of June 30, 2020. The French B2C mobile telephony market was disrupted by the entry of a fourth mobile operator in January 2012, which increased the overall level of competition in the market. After strong price decreases in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in mobile post-paid prices in France being among the lowest in Europe, price pressure eased in 2015 and 2016 but intensified again in 2017, weakened slightly in 2018, increased again in 2019 and remained relatively stable in 2020. The French B2C mobile telephony market is divided between (i) premium offers targeting subscribers seeking access to subsidized handsets, physical distribution, customer care, data services, value added services and content, (ii) no-frills offers targeting more cost-conscious, SIM-only, self-care subscribers and (iii) a decreasing proportion of prepaid subscribers. We target the premium post-paid subscription market with our “SFR” offers, the basic subscription mobile telephony market with our “RED” offers and the prepaid market with an offer of a prepaid range at attractive prices, under the “SFR _La Carte” offering. We continued to add new mobile post-paid subscribers in 2019 and in the first half of 2020,_ which enabled us to maintain our market position. The combination of our very-high-speed fiber/cable network and our 4G networks allow us to offer attractive flat rate 4P packages, which meet the growing demand for speed and bandwidth coming from multi-screen households, for usage both in and outside the home. Furthermore, following the French government’s announcement of the 5G spectrum auction, we and our peer competitors have each qualified to obtain one block of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each) and we intend to also bid competitively for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz in order to reinforce our market position. _Fixed. As at March 31, 2019, France had a relatively low penetration rate in the fast growing very-high-speed_ segment (which includes fiber/cable), with just 17% of total households being very-high-speed connections of over 100 Mbps (Source: European Commission DESI Report 2020). This compares to an average of 26% of consumer households in the European Union, 45% in Belgium and 40% in The Netherlands (Source: European _Commission DESI Report 2020). However, the fiber/cable fixed-line market in France has experienced strong_ growth in recent years due to an increasing household coverage, which has led to a 34% increase in very-high speed subscribers (over 100Mbps) between March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). The fiber/cable fixed-line market has also experienced intense price pressure over the past three years, as certain of our competitors have decreased prices for their fixed-line offers. We estimate that we are the largest operator in the fiber/cable market, with approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes passed as of June 30, 2020. The recent growth has been primarily driven by the increasing penetration of FTTB/FTTH. We believe that we are well positioned to benefit from further growth. We take advantage of our extensive and high-quality fiber/cable network, brand image and distribution capacities, to meet the growing demand for speed and bandwidth, with “multi-play” offers at competitive prices in the fixed-line B2C market. The French B2B telecommunications market has undergone a structural change in recent years, with traditional switched voice services decreasing and VoIP and data services increasing in number and complexity. In particular, the data service needs of medium-sized businesses have changed and are now more bandwidth-intensive and complex. Subscribers’ need for high speeds favors players with strong network coverage, such as the Group, due to our dense capillary network comprised of more than 165 metropolitan loops and our direct fiber/cable connection from our network to the main sites of our subscribers, which provides them with symmetrical high speeds and reliable service. In line with evolving market needs, we have also developed leading data solutions, among others “infrastructure as a service” and IP VPN services. We are also a strong challenger to the incumbent operator in the B2B market and, in recent years, have been able to strategically redeploy our French sales force to fully address, and compete effectively against, the incumbent operator in all B2B market sub-segments. We continue to take advantage of our commercial network and sales force to increase our market share in this segment and target adjacent market segments such as cloud computing services and machine-to-machine (“M2M”) communications. _Wholesale. In the wholesale telecommunications market, we are able to provide solutions at attractive prices for_ the short-term needs of operators through our extensive network and can obtain attractive margins by leveraging our cost structure. These solutions include selling fiber connections and circuits to international or local operators ----- with sub-networks in France, leasing indefeasible rights of use (“IRUs”) and bandwidth capacity on our network and selling point-to-point connections to other national operators including radio transit sites for the roll-out of 3G and 4G. We expect growth in the wholesale segment due to increasing worldwide data traffic, the migration of existing technologies towards Ethernet and fiber technologies, increasing demand for greater bandwidth and building of more antennas in connection with the roll-out of 4G coverage by operators. We believe we are a leading operator in the wholesale telephony segment due to our significant wholesale capabilities in the fiber sector. We have relationships with incumbent operators of French mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”) and fixed-line voice network operators (such as Bouygues Telecom), as well as with leading international players. We also intend to continue to promote our reactive and adapted wholesale offers in order to fully take advantage of our network infrastructure and maximize return on our network assets. _Media. The French television market is one of the largest in Europe. We have strategically developed our content_ capabilities to complement our fixed and mobile services and provide our subscribers with premium, high-quality content, including a large choice of high-definition channels, catch-up TV channels, the largest catalog of VOD content in France (through our “SFR Play” service), integrated OTT video services and innovative social media applications. Moreover, we offer subscribers leading 24-hour news through our TV news hub bundle, BFM. We believe that our high-quality pay-TV content programming is an important differentiating factor in our offering of bundled and convergent products.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,"We believe that we benefit from a network advantage, combining highly complementary state-of-the-art fixed and mobile networks.","We believe that we benefit from a fixed network advantage in the French market. Based on the current infrastructure of operators in the telecommunication industry, our network is the only end-to-end alternative central network in France to have a local loop infrastructure and is supplemented by our DSL presence and interurban fiber/cable network. This highly advanced fiber/cable network provides high download speeds and is supported by a powerful backbone. We have the largest fiber/cable network in France, passing approximately 17,457,000 homes (which provides broadband speeds of 100 Mbps and higher), including fiber/cable homes passed by SFR FTTH, as of June 30, 2020, and we have significantly increased our fiber/cable penetration, in particular through cross-selling fiber/cable offers to existing DSL subscribers. We are also expanding our existing fiber/cable network, having rolled out over 1,600,000 new fiber/cable homes passed in each of 2016 and 2017, and approximately a further 1,344,000 and 2,897,000 fiber/cable homes passed in 2018 and 2019, respectively (including homes passed by SFR FTTH). We will continue to focus on rolling out our fiber/cable network through engagement with local communities and governments. Additionally, as the first French operator to offer 4G technology to residential and business subscribers, we believe that we have one of the most expansive and advanced mobile networks of the alternative French players, offering 4G services to 99% of the French population as of June 30, 2020. We believe that we are also the leader in terms of 4G mobile antennas in service in France, with 46,176 antennas as of June 30, 2020. Furthermore, we expect to offer 5G technology to customers once the allocation process for the 5G spectrum auction is completed by the French government. We are also updating a large number of our antennas by equipping them with single radio access network (“Single-RAN”) technology (that supports 2G, 3G and 4G standards on one network) and fiber transmission, which we believe will reduce maintenance and infrastructure investment costs and ensure the quality of our infrastructure over time. The combination of our extensive, state-of-the-art fixed network and high-quality 4G mobile network allows us to respond to the rapidly increasing demand for data on mobile phones by providing high bandwidth fiber backhaul connections to connect the mobile Single-RAN. Our high level of prior investment and ownership of local networks, metropolitan loops and backbone in France provides us with a cost advantage compared to our alternative operator competitors, who must rely partially on the networks or technology of other operators to provide their services. For three years running, we have incurred significant capital expenditure (between 22-23% of total consolidated revenues) in order to improve our mobile network and to roll out new fiber homes. This also gives us a greater ability to control costs compared to our alternative operator competitors, determine the most accurate incremental capital expenditures and generate higher margins. We believe that we will be able to maintain this cost advantage in France so long as alternative competitors do not undertake significant investment and build their own networks. We also capitalized on our passive mobile infrastructure by consummating the Towers Transaction. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Hivory” for more information.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

We believe that the strength of our fixed and mobile businesses, and our ability to complement these services with premium content offerings, provide an opportunity to increase the penetration of our multi-play and premium packages. The demand for high-speed internet, fixed mobile convergence and high-quality content are key drivers of our cross-sell and up-sell strategy. _Very-high-speed broadband. We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the expected growth for very_ high speed broadband services as our network has been built and upgraded specifically to address the increasing speed and bandwidth requirements of our subscribers. We also continue to offer our existing DSL subscribers the option to subscribe to a fiber/cable offering, which provides an opportunity to significantly grow penetration on our network and to create upselling opportunities. Migrating existing DSL subscribers to our fiber/cable network also reduces the costs associated with renting the last mile and enables funds to be reallocated to accelerate the rollout of our fiber/cable network. We offer our fiber/cable subscribers very-high-speed broadband internet at speeds from 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps. We also provide our subscribers with access to one of the most advanced 4G mobile networks in France, offering high speeds and latency benefits. The combination of our extensive fixed network and high-quality 3G and 4G mobile networks allows us to capture the rapidly increasing demand for data on mobile phones driven by the digitization of everyday life, and in turn to upsell premium data and content services to new and existing mobile customers. _Comprehensive premium content. We are also focused on delivering high quality content offerings to complement_ our fixed and mobile services. We have direct long-term relationships with major content providers and television channel suppliers, enabling us to offer bundles that include an extensive array of HD channels as well as the largest VOD catalog in the market, with over 30,000 programs available, and an extensive catalog of HD and 4K/UHD content. We also benefit from our experience in sourcing media content from the largest French and international production companies (including NBCUniversal and Discovery) and our acquisition of NextRadioTV, which enable us to expand our catalog of media partners and premium content offerings. For example, we, through our Unrestricted Subsidiary SportCoTV, hold the rights to broadcast and/or distribute various premium sporting events, including the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, French Athletics Federation, English Premier League (through an agreement with Canal+), French Basketball League and English Rugby Premiership, which are commercialized in France via exclusive RMC branded channels. Furthermore, in July 2020, we entered into certain arrangements with Mediapro which further enhances our offering of premium sports content to our subscribers, by allowing us to broadcast Mediapro’s channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2). We will be the only operator in France to offer subscribers key French (Ligue 1, Ligue 2) and European (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, English Premier League, Spanish and Italian championships) football. For the seasons 2021/22, 2022/23 and 2023/24, Altice France has entered into a distribution agreement with Mediapro to distribute Mediapro’s channel TELEFOOT channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2) with a revenue share mechanism.

As per the document, the Group intends to introduce a voluntary departure plan aimed at reducing the workforce by around 228 full time employees and by limiting the use of part time workers, freelancers and consultants. The plan is expected to start at the end of 2020 or in early 2021. The management of the Group has also committed not to undertake a compulsory employee redundancy plan before November 2021 in the event that the targeted redundancies are not met.

In connection with this transfer, the Issuer will make an initial donation to FDPI, which will be invested by FDPI into _Presse Indépendante SAS, which in turn will acquire the shares in_ _Libération and consequently repay _Libération’s debts and finance its future operations. This will help ensure the editorial, economic and financial_ independence of Libération in the long term. The transfer is expected to be completed in September 2020. Following the closing of the transaction, the Group will no longer exercise control over Libération and therefore the assets and associated liabilities of Libération were classified as held for sale as per the provisions of IFRS 5 (Non-currents assets held for sale and discontinued _operations) in the “Consolidated Statement of Financial Position” as of June 30, 2020._",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Prior to such acquisition, a reorganization of Altice Europe’s structure relating to content activities was carried out, including the transfer of activities performed by Altice Entertainment News and Sport (“AENS”), an affiliate of the Group that previously provided the premium sports channels to the Issuer, to Altice Pictures, thereby ensuring that the entire value chain would subsequently be transferred to the Issuer, which is the entity that benefits the most from the marketing of the associated channels. Altice Pictures is expected to be merged into SportCoTV. SportCoTV has been designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary under the agreements, instruments and indentures governing the Group’s indebtedness, including the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement, the Existing Term Loans Agreement and the Indenture (and therefore will not be subject to any of the covenants set forth therein).

Following the restructuring, Altice France Holding holds 100% minus one share of the Issuer, with Altice Lux holding one share in the Issuer. See “Corporate and Financing Structure”. As part of such reorganization, certain upstream loans made by the Issuer to shareholders and affiliates of the Group were assigned to Altice France Holding. As of June 30, 2020, the aggregate principal amount of loans owed by the Group to its direct or indirect shareholders amounted to €2 million and the aggregate principal amount of loans owed to the Group by its direct or indirect shareholders amounted to €547 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,Recent Developments,9.4.6,COVID-19 Pandemic,"On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared by the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as a global pandemic. There have also been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by national, regional and local governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus. In response, we have complied with the guidelines provided by the French government and taken measures in order to ensure the health and safety of, and minimize the impact of the pandemic on, our employees, customers, business and operations. In addition, as part of economic measures intended to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses, the French government announced a series of measures, certain of which we were entitled to benefit from, including a partial unemployment benefit for employee salaries. We decided to apply for such government benefit with respect to around 4,600 employees whose jobs were directly impacted by the mandatory lockdown imposed by the French government. Under such measure, the French government paid the relevant employees the equivalent of 84% of their fixed and variable pay per month for the period between March 2020 and May 2020 and the Group paid the remaining 16%. There were no restrictions on the Group’s business associated with subscribing to such measure. ----- We have continued to provide our telecommunications services to our customers during this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a limited impact on the financial results of the Group as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 demonstrating a resilient telecom business, although we have been adversely impacted by a decline in handsets sales due to store closures, a decrease in roaming revenue, some delays in the construction of FTTH homes and a decline in advertising revenue. We expect that our future results may be impacted, including if residential or business customers discontinue their service or are unable to pay for our products and services, if roaming revenue continues to decline due to reduced international travel or if advertising revenue continues to decline. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business, we may continue to delay certain capital investments. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and duration of business and economic impacts relating to COVID-19 pandemic, including the effort to contain and combat the spread of the virus, and business impacts of government actions, we currently cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The Group has taken into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its accounting estimates, notably those related to the valuation of non-current and current assets (including goodwill). The carrying value of the non-current and current assets has not been adjusted as of June 30, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(2) Prior to adoption of IFRS 16 Adjusted EBITDA was defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, nonrecurring items (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses. Following the application of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, non-recurring items (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs) and share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IAS 17 (Leases) for operating leases) allowing comparability for each of the periods presented. The Group believes that this measure is useful to investors as it provides them with a measure that excludes certain items that the Group considers to be outside its recurring operating activities or that are non-cash, making trends more easily observable and providing information regarding the Group’s earnings and cash-flow generation that allows investors to identify trends in its financial performance. It should not be considered as a substitute measure for operating profit or profit for the period (as determined in accordance with IFRS), cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities or any ----- other measures of performance under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",13.1.1,The Group faces significant competition in each of the industries in which the Group operates and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The French telecommunications market is a mature market, marked by very active competition between the main operators and very strong pressure on prices. Despite growth in market size, the French telecommunications market has recently declined in value primarily due to price pressure in the mobile market following the arrival of a fourth player in 2012 and the decline in regulated call termination rates. The Group faces significant competition from established and more recent competitors and may face competition from new entrants and market concentrations in the future. While the nature and level of competition to which the Group is subject vary according to the products and services that it offers, in each case the Group generally competes on the basis of prices, marketing, products, network coverage, characteristics of services, and customer service. The main competitor of the Group in the residential and business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France, that has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group’s and that is unlikely to be duplicated or matched by the Group in the near future. Bouygues Telecom Enterprises (“Bouygues Telecom”) and Iliad are the Group’s major competitors in the residential market. In the premium pay-TV market, Groupe Canal+ products are available throughout the French territory via satellite, cable, and DTT and DSL technologies. The Group’s main competitor in business services markets overall is Orange, the incumbent telecommunications operator in France. Orange has greater financial resources and owns a more extensive network than the Group which the Group is unlikely to duplicate or match in the near future. In the residential market, in addition to Orange and Bouygues Telecom, the Group also competes with international telecommunications operators such as Colt, Verizon, AT&T, and BT, which offer multinationals access to their international networks while the Group’s network is available only in France. The Group also has operations in the French Overseas Territories that face competition and competitive pressure risks similar to those described herein. The Group’s products and services are also subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. New players from sectors that are either unregulated or subject to different regulations (including internet players such as Yahoo!, Google, Disney+, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other audiovisual players, media players and “over the top” (“OTT”) (of an existing broadband internet network) players) have also emerged as competitors to the Group’s video content offering. These players are taking advantage of improved connectivity and platform agnostic technologies to offer OTT and cloud-based services. Telecommunications operators are expected to maintain traditional access services and billing relationships over which users access services from adjacent players such as well-known companies offering music, video, photos, apps and retail. The rapid success of audiovisual content streamed through the telecommunications network and insufficient innovation could lead to the emergence of other content or service providers as well as the saturation of the market, which would put pressure on the revenues and margins of operators like the Group, while simultaneously requiring them to increase capital expenditures to remain competitive, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition or results of operations. ----- Moreover, the Group is also facing competition from non-traditional mobile voice and data services based on new mobile internet technologies, in particular OTT applications, such as Skype, Google Talk, Facetime, Viber and WhatsApp. These OTT applications are often free of charge, accessible via smartphones and allow their users to have access to potentially unlimited messaging and voice services over the internet, thus bypassing more expensive traditional voice and messaging services, such as SMS and MMS, provided by mobile network operators, who are only able to charge the internet data usage for such services. All telecommunications operators are currently competing with OTT service providers who leverage existing infrastructures and operate capitallight business models, enhancing their ability to compete with businesses, such as the Group’s, which operate capital-intensive business models. OTT service providers have over the past years become more sophisticated and technological developments have led to a significant improvement in the quality of service, particularly in speech quality. In addition, players with strong brand capability and financial strength, such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, have turned their attention to the provision of OTT audio and data services. In the long term, if nontraditional mobile voice and data services or similar services continue to increase in popularity and if the Group, or more generally all of the telecommunications operators, are not able to address this competition, this could cause declines in subscriber base and profitability across all of the Group’s products and services, among other material adverse effects. In addition, the Group may face increasing competition from the large-scale roll-out of public Wifi networks by local governments and utilities and transportation service providers, new and existing Wifi telecommunications operators and others, which particularly benefits OTT service providers. Due to their ability to leverage existing infrastructure and to roll out public Wifi in a cost-efficient way, the Group’s competitors may be better positioned to offer their customers public Wifi access at attractive terms and conditions or as part of their current mobile and landline offerings, which may affect the Group’s ability to retain or acquire customers. Furthermore, the Group’s competitors may realize cost savings by off-loading mobile data traffic onto their own Wifi networks or those of their partners in order to reduce costs and increase bandwidth more quickly or efficiently than the Group can. An increase in public Wifi networks could also cause declines in profitability as demand for the Group’s network and services decreases. The following is an overview of the competitive landscape in France: _1. Residential—Mobile_ The Group competes with service providers that use alternative technologies for internet access, such as satellite technologies or mobile standards such as universal mobile telecommunications system (“UMTS”) and 3G/4G mobile technologies. These mobile broadband high speed internet access technologies may enable both incumbent and new broadband access providers to provide high bandwidth connection services for voice and data. Furthermore, additional access technologies may be launched in the future that will further increase competition or lead the Group to increase capital expenditure for additional upgrades. Providers of mobile broadband internet access may be able to offer fast internet access speeds at a competitive cost, with the additional possibility of allowing subscribers to access the internet remotely. The French mobile telephony market is characterized by competition among well-established mobile network operators such as Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free and other operators without their own mobile networks. Competition has intensified, particularly as to price, since Free entered the market in early 2012 with a low-priced unlimited calling package. The mobile telephony market in France is currently undergoing a transformation because of competitive pricing, bundled packages no longer including subsidized handsets and the development of “low cost” brands. After strong price decreases in 2013 and 2014, which resulted in mobile post-paid prices in France being among the lowest in Europe, price pressure eased in 2015 and 2016 but intensified again in 2017, weakened slightly in 2018, increased again in 2019, and remained stable in 2020. If price pressure continues to intensify, the Group’s results of operations and financial condition in future periods may be materially adversely affected. _2. Residential—Fixed_ In the French pay-TV market, the Group competes with providers of premium television packages such as CanalSat, DSL triple-play and/or quadruple-play operators such as Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which provide IPTV, and providers of pay DTT (such as Canal+, which operates across multiple formats: including IPTV, pay DTT, satellite and cable). The growth of IPTV, which is the most popular pay-TV distribution platform followed by satellite and DTT, has changed the market, opening up the provision of pay-TV services beyond the ----- traditional methods of cable and satellite, which is limited by the inability to install a satellite dish on the façade of buildings in certain areas, such as central Paris. The Group also competes with satellite television services that may be able to offer a greater range of channels to a larger audience, reaching wider geographic areas (especially in rural areas) for lower prices than the prices of the Group’s cable pay-TV services. Any increase in market share of satellite distribution may have a negative impact on the success of the Group’s digital cable television services. The Group also faces competition from satellite distribution of free to air television programming. While pay DTT’s share of the pay-TV market is currently low, providers of pay DTT may in the future be able to offer a wider range of channels to a larger audience for lower prices than the Group charges. In the broadband market, the Group provides high speed internet through its cable, FTTH and xDSL networks and it competes primarily with xDSL and FTTH providers, with FTTH currently being the most widespread technology used to access very high speed internet in France. Orange is the leading DSL provider in France, followed by Free, the Group and Bouygues Telecom. While the Group believes that it has the network advantage in terms of its fiber optic/cable network compared to its competitors’ xDSL networks, and better coverage of fiber networks as compared to its competitors, which currently places the Group at a competitive advantage to exploit the increased demand in France for very-high-speed internet in the areas covered by the Group’s fiber optic/cable network, such competitive advantage may be diminished to the extent that competitors increase the roll out their FTTH networks. For further information see “The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by _competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.” In addition, the_ Group’s xDSL competitors’ networks cover more French households than the Group’s network and pricing is very competitive. _3. Business Services—B2B_ In the B2B segment the Group’s main competitors are Orange (Orange Business Services) and Colt. Bouygues Telecom is also a competitor in the SME segment. The French B2B market for voice services is extremely price sensitive, with sophisticated customers, relatively short term (typically one year) contracts, and vulnerability to cuts in mobile termination rates. The ability to compete effectively is partially a function of network capillarity, and certain of the Group’s competitors have a more extensive and denser network than us. In the data market, customers also often seek combined infrastructure and software solutions. As a result, the Group also competes with software and other IT providers of data and network solutions, which may decrease the value customers place on its infrastructure solutions, leading to a reduction in its prices and margins. IT providers may also partner with the Group’s infrastructure telecommunications competitors. _4. Business Services—Wholesale_ The French wholesale telecommunications market is dominated by Orange and the Group, although Orange’s and the Group’s market shares vary depending on the segment. The Group also faces competition from consortiums of telecommunications operators and construction companies, such as Covage, Vinci, Eiffage and Axiom (who may lay down fiber in construction sites and then lease them on the wholesale market). The wholesale market for data services in France is less volatile than the voice market. Competition is based primarily, in addition to price, on service quality and technological advancement. The wholesale market for dark fiber infrastructure in France is more open than for wholesale voice and data carriage, as providing it does not require having a dense, national network and does not include any services would require technical expertise. The Group expects competition in the French telecommunications industry to remain intense and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be negatively impacted by any future consolidation of the Group’s competitors or similar developments in one or more of the markets in which the Group competes.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",13.1.2,The deployment of fiber optic networks and/or VDSL2 by competitors of the Group could reduce and ultimately eliminate the gap between the speed and the power of the fiber optic/cable network of the Group compared to the DSL networks of its main competitors.,"The Group believes that one of its major competitive advantages is the power and speed of its fiber optic/cable network. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s network passed approximately 17,457,000 fiber/cable homes, including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH. However, competitors of the Group are also deploying fiber and/or VDSL2 networks enabling download speeds and bandwidths that could rival those reached by the Group’s network, and thus strongly reduce the Group’s competitive advantage. The Group’s main competitors (Orange, ----- Free and Bouygues Telecom) have begun to introduce FTTH networks to increase and harmonize their network speed. On December 4, 2019, Orange unveiled its strategic plan through 2025 indicating its objectives for FTTH lines to include the deployment of approximately 19 million lines in private areas (compared to 10.4 million already rolled-out as of June 2019) and approximately 4 million lines in investment areas (compared to 0.4 million as of June 2019) in addition of approximately 13 million lines deployed by a third party and co-financed by Orange by 2023 (Source: _Orange press release). Furthermore, other operators may obtain access to the infrastructure deployed by an operator, through joint projects for financing. All of the DSL operators have announced various agreements on sharing the deployment of FTTH in given areas. For example, Orange and Free entered into a contract in July 2013 providing for the deployment by Free of a fiber network using Orange’s infrastructure in approximately 20 French cities, which allows for open access to all competing operators. In addition, in 2013 the French government announced a FTTH deployment plan of €20 billion (invested by private operators and local authorities) with the objective of providing very-high-speed internet access to the entire territory in 2022. The government will provide a subsidy package of approximately €3,300 million, partly from funding from the Investments for the Future Program managed by the Office of the General Commissioner of Investment under the 2015 Budget Act. The rollout has been divided in three zones: very dense areas (approximately six million households) and low-density areas (approximately 13 million households), that are already covered or will be covered by FTTH with privately-funded networks; and low-density areas (approximately 15 million households), where private operators will co-invest with public partners. Orange and the Group will lead the deployment of the very-high speed network in privately-funded, low density areas, with the Group being in charge of approximately 20% of the network deployment. Various local and regional authorities have already extended subsidies to network operators, including the Group, to install FTTH connections. This trend should continue, as certain departments, municipalities and regions, such as Hauts-deSeine, Amiens and Louvin, for example, have entered into public-private partnerships to encourage such investments. In such areas, various operators will have access to the network and will be able to compete. In addition, in accordance with the conditions established by ARCEP, third-party operators may have access to the infrastructure used by an operator, including by co-financing projects, for their own very-high-speed internet offers. As a result, FTTH deployment by the Group’s competitors could accelerate and the share of FTTH on the highspeed internet market could grow significantly, thereby eliminating or reducing the Group’s fixed network advantage. VDSL2 technology has also been implemented in some areas by competitors of the Group. Deployment of VDSL2 only requires adding VDSL2 cards in already deployed digital subscriber line access multiplexers (“DSLAMs”) and does not involve physical intervention at the subscriber’s premises. Moreover, the deployment of this technology has accelerated since October 2014 given the favorable opinion of the copper experts committee that has allowed the marketing, starting from that date, of VDSL2 in indirect distribution on all lines from a main distribution frame (“MDF”) on Orange’s local copper loop. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 5,950,000 households were eligible for VDSL2 (source: ARCEP). If the competitors of the Group continue to deploy or significantly increase their fiber optic networks they could be able to compete with the Group in terms of the offering of high-speed internet and television services of a quality and speed greater than or equal to those of the Group, thus potentially eliminating the Group’s current competitive advantage, increasing the pressure upon prices and margins and leading the Group to make significant investments in order to match the services they offer. Deployment of VDSL2 and/or fiber optic networks by competitors also represents a risk for the business services activity of the Group, particularly with regard to medium-sized, small-to-medium-sized and very-small-sized businesses to which the Group’s DSL and fiber/cable networks network presently represent an advantage. Although the Group is preparing for this deployment by improving its product range and building out its fiber/cable network, such deployment could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video, sports and other content. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the content market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage the Group’s business, as its fundamental proposition of virtually all content being offered for ----- free to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of content, including broadcasters, as well as internet based e-commerce or content providers are increasing their internetbased offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market, or existing providers may adjust their services, with unique offerings or approaches to providing content. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.

The Group may continue to grow its business through acquisitions of broadband and mobile communications businesses, content companies and ancillary services that we believe will present opportunities to create value by generating strong cash flows and operational synergies. In addition, we have recently entered into certain strategic transactions, such as the Towers Transactions and the sale of the Group’s Voice Carrier Business, to monetize the value of certain of our non-core assets in France, and the sale of a 49.99% interest in SFR FTTH to create an alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator. Moreover, SFR FTTH (an associate of the Group) has entered into agreement to acquire all of the equity interests in Covage, which transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020. In the future, the Group may enter into similar transactions. Any acquisition, disposal or other strategic transaction the Group may undertake in the future could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in interest expenses, amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or in the use by us of available cash on hand to finance any such acquisitions. The Group may experience difficulties in integrating acquired operations into the Group’s business, incur higher than expected costs or fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of these acquisitions, if any. Such transactions may also disrupt the Group’s relationships with current and new employees, customers and suppliers. In addition, the Group’s management may be distracted by such acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses. Thus, if the Group consummates any further acquisitions or fail to integrate any previous acquisitions, there could be a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing business acquisitions or integrating previously acquired companies. In addition, the Group’s debt burden may increase if we borrow funds to finance any future transactions, which could have a negative impact on the Group’s cash flows and the Group’s ability to finance our overall operations. Acquisitions or disposals of additional telecommunications companies may require the approval of governmental authorities (either domestically or, in the case of the EU, at the EU level), which can block, impose conditions on, or delay the process which could result in a failure on our part to proceed with announced transactions on a timely basis or at all, thus hampering our opportunities for growth. In the event conditions are imposed and we fail to meet them in a timely manner, the relevant governmental authority may impose fines and, if in connection with a merger transaction, may require restorative measures, such as mandatory disposition of assets or divestiture of operations. Although we analyze and conduct due diligence on acquisition targets, our assessments are subject to a number of assumptions concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations and our inquiries may fail to uncover relevant information. There can be no assurance that our assessments or due diligence of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments may differ significantly from our expectations. Moreover, our plans to acquire additional businesses in the future are subject to the availability of suitable opportunities. The Group’s competitors may also follow similar acquisition strategies and may have greater financial resources available for investments or may be willing to accept less favorable terms than we can accept, which may prevent us from acquiring businesses that we target to the benefit of our competitors. ----- The operating complexity of the Group’s business and the responsibilities of management have increased significantly as a result of the growth of our business through acquisitions, which may place significant strain on our managerial and operational resources. The Group may be unable to allocate sufficient managerial and operational resources to meet our needs as our business grows, and our current operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures may become inadequate. Although the Group considers the operational and financial systems and managerial controls and procedures that we currently have in place to be adequate for the Group’s purposes, we recognize that the effectiveness of these systems, controls and procedures needs to be kept under regular review as the Group’s business grows. The Group will have to maintain close coordination among our logistical, technical, accounting, finance, marketing and sales personnel. Management of growth will also require, among other things, continued development of financial and management controls and information technology systems. The constant growth may strain our managerial resources which may require the Group to hire additional managerial resources. The Group may be unable to hire managers with the relevant expertise or the hiring process may require significant time and resources, all of which could result in a disruption in the Group’s management, growth, operational and financial systems, managerial controls and procedures and, accordingly, the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group periodically evaluates, and has engaged in, the disposition of certain non-core assets and businesses. Divestitures could involve difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, the diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. After reaching an agreement with a buyer for the disposition of a business, the transaction may be subject to the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to obtaining necessary regulatory and government approvals, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction. Divestitures may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested assets and businesses, such as indemnities or other financial obligations, in which the performance of the divested assets or businesses could impact our results of operations. Any divestiture the Group undertakes could adversely affect the Group’s financial condition and results of operations. In certain cases, the Group has entered into or may enter into joint venture arrangements with a majority or minority interest in such joint ventures. Even in cases where the Group has retained a majority interest, the joint venture partner may have significant influence over policies, including consent rights with respect to certain specified matters. The Group has a lesser degree of control over the business operations of the joint ventures and businesses in which it has made minority investments.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",13.1.5,The Group might not be able to effectively implement or adapt its business strategy.,"The Group has based its strategy on its vision of the market, especially the importance of very-high-speed fiber/cable and mobile networks and of fixed-mobile convergence. At the core of the Group’s strategy has been revenue, profitability and cash flow growth. Key elements of this strategy have included: (i) operational and financial turnaround under the leadership of a new management team; (ii) optimizing commercial performance with a particular focus on customer services; (iii) continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with its market position; and (iv) monetizing content investments through various pay-TV models and growing advertising revenue. However, the Group is evolving in a market affected by economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainty and the Group must regularly adapt its business model to take into account market changes such as changes in consumer behavior, introduction of new technology, products or services, competition and the development of specific pricing policies, the adaptation of its structural costs, the streamlining of its operational organization, and the adaptation of its sales strategy. If the measures taken by the Group do not meet the demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer, it will have an adverse effect on the return on investments, financial targets, market share, and revenues generated. Consequently, any development of the Group’s business strategy that proves not to be sufficiently adapted to the actual trends and demands, expectations, or habits of the consumer in the telecommunications market may not achieve its desired goals and/or have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position and results of operations. Moreover, the transformation of the Group following the execution of certain strategic transactions, including non-core asset disposals, strategic acquisitions and investments or entry into joint venture arrangements, could create operational difficulties and unforeseen expenses and could give rise to significant administrative, financial, and managerial challenges involving the activity of the Group. Such strategic transactions may also disrupt its ongoing business, cause management’s attention to be diverted and result in legal, regulatory, contractual, labor, or other difficulties that have not been foreseen or disclosed. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

While the Group’s total revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31 2018, there was a decrease in revenues in the residential-fixed and media segments. Similarly, while the Group’s total revenue increased for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019, there was a decrease in revenues in the equipment sales and media segments. The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to June 30, 2019, but increased for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. While the Group is focused on achieving an operational financial turnaround, there can be no assurance that this trend of declines in revenue will not continue in future periods. The Group expects its DSL business with Bouygues Telecom to continue to decline. In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers. If the revenue and profitability loss from such businesses is not offset by revenue and profitability growth in other Group businesses, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business activities, the results of its operation and financial condition. In addition, the Group could experience further decreases in customers on its DSL network in the future due to their migration to fiber/cable networks providing them with access to greater internet speeds compared with those available on DSL networks.

Customer churn is a measure of the number of customers who stop subscribing for one or more of our products or services. Churn arises mainly as a result of the contractual subscription period (generally 12 months in the residential segments and between one and three years in the business services market), competitive influences, the relocation of clients outside of the Group’s network area (which is less extensive than our competitors), introduction of new products and technologies, deterioration of personal financial circumstances, price increases and regulatory developments. Customer churn may also increase if the Group is unable to deliver satisfactory services over its network, or if it modifies the types of services it makes available in a certain region. In addition, customer churn also arises upon the cancellation of services to customers who are delinquent in their payments to the Group. In addition, the Group outsources many of its customer service functions to third party contractors over which the Group has less control than if it were performing those tasks itself. The Group has experienced significant churn in mobile and fixed customers in recent years due to intense competition. Moreover, the churn rate in the Group’s white label business may increase for reasons outside the Group’s control (as it is not involved in client services and retention). In particular, churn in Bouygues Telecom’s DSL white label customers has already led to a decrease in white label subscribers, which is expected to continue in the long term. See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—White Label Agreements”. If the Group fails to effectively communicate the benefits of the Group’s networks through its marketing advertising efforts, it may not be able to attract new customers and our efforts to attract and retain customers may prove unsuccessful. In addition, any interruption of the Group’s services or the removal or unavailability of programming, which may not be under our control, could contribute to increased customer churn. Further the Group’s competitors may improve their ability to attract new customers, for example by offering new product bundles or product offerings at lower prices than the Group, which would make it difficult for the Group to retain its current subscribers, and the cost of retaining and acquiring new subscribers could increase. In addition, the Group’s business services operations are also subject to tariff churn (i.e. an existing customer negotiating tariff decreases). Large corporate customers in particular are highly sophisticated and often aggressive in seeking to renegotiate the pricing of their contracts, which tends to result in margin pressure. Increased customer or tariff churn may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

For example, the ability to provide movies, sports and other popular programming, including videoon-demand (“VOD”) content, is a major factor that attracts subscribers to pay-TV services, especially premium services. The Group relies on digital programming suppliers for a significant portion of the Group’s programming content and VOD services. The Group may not be able to obtain sufficient high quality programming, sports and other content from third party producers for the Group’s digital cable television and other services on satisfactory terms or at all in order to offer compelling digital cable television services. The Group also relies on certain of its competitors for the provision of certain content offerings. In addition, to the extent that the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain content providers on terms that the Group believes is reasonable, the Group may be forced, or may determine for strategic or business reasons, to remove such content from its line-up and may decide to replace it with other programming, which may not be available on acceptable terms or be as attractive to customers. There can be no assurance that the Group’s expiring programming and other content contracts will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms or at all, or that the rights the Group negotiates will be adequate for it to execute the Group’s business strategy. The inability to obtain high quality content, may also limit the Group’s ability to migrate customers from lower tier programming to higher tier products, thereby inhibiting the Group’s ability to execute its business strategy. Any or all of these factors could result in reduced demand for, and lower revenue and profitability from, the Group’s digital cable television and other content services. Programming and content-related costs are one of the Group’s largest categories of expenses. In recent years, the cost of programming in the cable and satellite video industries has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase, particularly with respect to costs for sports programming and broadcast networks. The Group may not be able to pass these increased programming costs on to the Group’s subscribers due to the increasingly competitive environment that the Group operates in. If the Group is unable to pass these increased programming costs on to its subscribers, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Moreover, programming costs typically include a minimum guaranteed amount and a variable amount related directly to the number of subscribers to whom the programming is provided, which may affect the Group’s ability to negotiate lower per-subscriber programming costs and which could impact the Group’s operating margins. The expiration dates of the Group’s various programming contracts are staggered, which results in the expiration of a portion of its programming contracts throughout each year. The Group may not be able to renegotiate these agreements on terms as favorable as those of the current agreements, or at all, which could result in a decline in the revenue generated or an increase in the Group’s costs deriving from broadcaster licences. The Group attempts to control its programming costs and, therefore, the cost of the video services it charges to its customers, by negotiating favorable terms for the renewal of its affiliation agreements with programmers. To the ----- extent the Group is unable to reach agreements with certain programmers on terms it believes are reasonable, the Group may be forced to, or determine for strategic reasons to, remove certain programming from its line-up and may decide to replace such programming with alternatives which may not be as attractive to consumers or available on acceptable terms. Such negotiations have in the past and may in the future affect the Group’s carriage of particular programming services. Some of the Group’s programming contracts require it to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed minimum number of subscribers, even if that number is larger than the number of actual subscribers, whereas some of the Group’s programming contracts are based on a flat fee irrespective of the popularity of the content purchased under such contract. As a result, if the Group misjudges anticipated demand for the programming or if the programming it acquires does not attract the number of viewers anticipated, the profitability of the Group’s television services may be impaired. Furthermore, as the Group purchases a significant portion of its content from various content providers under relatively short term contracts, the prices the Group pays to purchase such content is subject to change and may increase significantly in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s results of operations. Furthermore, program providers and broadcasters may elect to distribute their programming through other distribution platforms, such as satellite platforms, digital terrestrial broadcasting or IPTV, or may enter into exclusive arrangements with other distributors. Such actions may inconvenience some of the Group’s subscribers and can lead to customer dissatisfaction and, in certain cases, the loss of customers, which may have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, as long as the Group continues to develop its VOD and other interactive services, its ability to acquire programs for its free VOD offerings (replay), VOD by subscription, and one-time VOD will become more and more crucial and will depend on the ability of the Group to maintain a relationship and cooperation with content providers and broadcasters, for both standard-definition as well as HD content. If the Group cannot obtain and keep competitive programs at attractive prices on its networks, demand for its services could decline, thus limiting its ability to maintain or increase the revenue.

In particular, the Group incurs significant capital expenses for the deployment of new technologies such as 4G and 5G (for the purchase of frequencies and the deployment of network infrastructures) for its mobile operations and fiber optics (for the deployment of the fiber infrastructure) and for its fixed operations. Moreover, as spectrum auctions are infrequent and the Group may need additional spectrum in the future, the Group will likely participate in future spectrum auctions even though it might not, at the time of auction, require additional spectrum capacity. Such participation would require significant capital expenditures in the near term as acquiring spectrum is expensive, due in part to the fact that spectrum availability is limited. Furthermore, new technologies and the use of multiple applications increasing customers’ bandwidth requirements could lead to saturation of the networks and require telecommunications operators to make additional investments to increase the capacity of their infrastructures. Moreover, the Group regularly invests in the content that we offer in order to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming and other content options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content, in order to reduce churn. For example, the structure of the French telecommunications market does not allow telecommunications operators to pass along their investment costs to the end consumer in proportion to the volume of data consumed. Accordingly, telecommunications operators may not benefit from increased revenues from the growing demand for data and content even though they incur the costs of such demand through their investments in infrastructure. The Group is also bound by certain obligations of access and/or coverage for its fiber/cable and/or mobile network, particularly under its mobile licences, such as obligations to allow roaming or sharing of networks in certain deployment zones. This requires the Group to make significant and frequent investments and the conditions for ----- the implementation of these obligations, including some prices (such as roaming rates), may be regulated within the EU. Given such constraints, the Group may not be able to operate its network under economically favorable conditions, which could affect the profitability of its investments.

A flood, fire, other natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, power failure, cyber-attack, computer virus or other catastrophe affecting a portion of the Group’s network could have a material adverse impact on its business and its relations with customers.

Measures with the aim of remedying such disasters, safety and security measures, or measures for protecting service continuity that have been undertaken or may be undertaken in the future by the Group, as well as the effects thereof on the performance of its network, could be insufficient to avoid losses. The Group is insured against operating losses only up to a capped amount, any disaster or other damage affecting the network of the Group could result in significant uninsured losses. The Group’s network may be subjected to disruptions and to significant technological problems, and such difficulties could escalate over time. For example, although the Group’s cable networks are generally built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network availability in the event of any damage to its underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations, transmission signals will not be able to pass through, which could cause significant damage to the Group’s business. In the event of a power outage or other shortage, we do not have a back up or alternative supply source for all of the Group’s network components. The occurrence of any such event could cause interruptions in service or reduce capacity for customers, either of which could reduce the Group’s revenue or cause the Group to incur additional expenses. In addition, the occurrence of any such event may subject us to penalties and other sanctions imposed by regulators. Further, the Group may incur costs and revenue losses associated with the unauthorized use of the Group’s networks, including administrative and capital costs associated with the unpaid use of the Group’s networks as well as with detecting, monitoring and reducing the incidences of fraud. Fraud also impacts interconnection costs, capacity costs, administrative costs and payments to other carriers for unbillable fraudulent roaming charges. In addition, the Group’s business depends on certain crucial systems, particularly its network operations center and its billing and customer service systems. In particular, the support for a large number of systems critical to the network of the Group is located at a relatively limited number of sites. While the Group has extensive backup systems, the risk that these systems may not be sufficient to handle a spike in activity cannot be ruled out, which could lead to a slowdown or unavailability of IT systems for a period of time and, when involving the business ----- services customers of the Group, to financial penalties. Moreover, the Group may incur legal penalties and reputational damages to the extent that any accident or security breach results in a loss of or damage to customers’ data or applications or the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information. Moreover, the technical projects of the Group that are in progress, involving both information systems and networks, and the plans for migrations planned in the short and medium terms for certain pieces of mobile network equipment, may generate an increased risk of failures of networks and information systems. In particular, the quality of the networks could be impacted by the deployment of the 4G network as well as by the concurrent work of renovating 2G and 3G networks, requiring, among other things, frequent technical interventions. Such work could also result in breakdowns or interruptions in services for the customers of the Group. Furthermore, the development of the resources used by consumers (for example, videoconferencing, telepresence, and cloud computing for business services customers), of the “Internet of Things”, and of new terminals (smartphones, tablets, etc.) may generate risks of saturating the networks due to the large volumes of data that such resources generate or promote the use of. The end-of-year period is an extremely sensitive sales period. A major failure of the information systems or of any component of the chain of production and logistics during that period would have negative consequences on revenues. To reduce the likelihood of this type of risk occurring, the Group avoids changes to the network and information systems during this period of the year (starting in mid-November until the end of the year), however, there can be no assurance that there will be no failure of the Group’s network and information systems during the end-of-year period. Should all or some of the risks described above materialize, this could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In certain cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making it difficult for the Group to quickly change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses to offer favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that the Group requires. For example, while we continue to promote a rapid take up of our premium multi-play services using a single set-top box, the Group faces potential risks in securing the required customer set-top box equipment to maintain this roll out as the Group currently relies on a single provider. Currently, the Group has a sufficient supply of these boxes available, but any future shortages may involve significant delays in seeking alternative supplies, may constrain its ability to meet customer demand and may result in increased customer churn. Further, in the event that hardware or software products or related services are defective, it may be difficult or impossible to enforce recourse claims against suppliers, especially if warranties included in contracts with suppliers have expired or are exceeded by those in our contracts with the Group’s subscribers, in individual cases, or if the suppliers are insolvent, in whole or in part. In addition, there can be no assurances that the Group will be able to obtain the hardware, software and services it needs for the operation of the Group’s business in a timely manner, at competitive terms and in adequate amounts. In particular, in the case of an industry wide cyclical upturn or high demand for a particular product, the Group’s suppliers of software, hardware and other services may receive customer orders beyond the capacity of their operations, which could result in delivery delays, particularly where suppliers elect to prioritize other customer accounts. The Group has, from time to time, experienced extensions of lead times or limited supplies due to capacity constraints and other supply-related factors as well as quality control problems with service providers. The Group may also not be able to recover monies paid to such suppliers or obtain contractual damages to which the Group may be entitled (if any) in the event our suppliers fail to comply with their obligations in a timely manner. The Group also outsources some of its support services, including parts of its subscriber services, information technology support, technical services, and maintenance operations. Should any of these arrangements be terminated by either contract party, this could result in delays or disruptions to the Group’s operations and could result in it incurring additional costs, including if the outsourcing counterparty increases pricing or if the Group is required to locate alternative service providers or in-source previously outsourced services. ----- The Group is dependent on various third parties in order to provide commercially viable services. For example, the Group depends on Orange to access a portion of its network infrastructure and on Bouygues Telecom for access to certain mobile networks. The Group is generally dependent on access to sites and network infrastructure owned by third parties, including duct space and antennas used for our networks and facility space (colocation). In addition, the Group’s telephony services are reliant on its ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks of other fixed-line, mobile and international operators globally. The Group has limited or no control over the quality and consistency of the services that are supplied to us by third parties. Any deterioration in the provision of such services may affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The Group’s ability to renew its existing contracts with suppliers of products or services or enter into new contractual relationships with these or other suppliers upon the expiration of existing agreements, either on commercially attractive terms, or at all, depends on a range of commercial and operational factors and events which may be beyond its control. The occurrence of any of these risks or a significant disruption in the Group’s supply of equipment and services from key sourcing partners could create technical problems, damage its reputation, result in the loss of customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The introduction of new product offerings can initially place significant pressure on the Group’s customer service personnel. Increased pressure on such functions is generally associated with decreased satisfaction of customers. In the business services market, customers require service to be extremely reliable and to be re-established within short timeframes if there is any disruption. Penalties are often payable in the case of failure to meet expected service quality. In addition, product installation can be complex, requiring specialized knowledge and expensive equipment. Delays and service problems may result in both penalties and the potential loss of customers. In these segments, the Group relies on its experienced customer relations personnel to handle any customer issues or requests, and the loss of such personnel can result in the loss of customers. The Group has, in the past, experienced significant levels of customer dissatisfaction as a result of operational difficulties. Improvements to customer service functions may be necessary to achieve desired growth levels, and, if the Group fails to manage such improvements effectively and achieve such growth, the Group may in the future experience customer service problems and damage its reputation, contribute to increased churn and/or limit or slow the Group’s future growth.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Even though the Group requires its conditional access system providers to provide state of the art security for the conditional access systems, the security of the Group’s conditional access systems may be compromised by illegal piracy and other means. In addition, the Group’s set-top boxes require smart cards before subscribers can receive programming and its smart cards have been and may continue to be illegally duplicated, providing unlawful access to our television signals. While the Group works diligently to reduce the effect of piracy, there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to successfully eliminate the piracy it currently faces. In addition, there can be no assurance that any new conditional access system security that the Group may put in place will not be circumvented. Encryption failures could result in lower revenue, higher costs and increased basic cable subscriber churn or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,"Risks Relating to the Group’s Business, Technology and Competition",13.1.17,"If the Group fails to successfully introduce new technologies or services, or to respond to technological developments, its business and level of revenue may be adversely affected and it may not be able to recover the cost of investments that it has made.","The Group’s business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services, and it is difficult to forecast the impact such technological innovations will have on our business. If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that the Group introduces fail to achieve broad market acceptance or experience technical difficulties, the Group’s revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be ----- adversely affected. As a result, the Group may not recover investments that it makes in order to deploy these technologies and services. Enhanced fixed service infrastructure access and mobile services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers, and new technologies may enable the Group’s competitors to offer not only new services, but to also offer existing standard services at lower prices. The Group may not be able to fund the capital expenditures necessary to keep pace with technological developments. It is possible that alternative technologies that are more advanced than those the Group currently provides may be developed. The Group may not obtain the expected benefits of its investments if more advanced technology is adopted by the market. While the Group attempts to stay ahead of the market, closely following technological developments and making investments implementing such developments, it is difficult to forecast the effect that technical innovations will have on the Group’s business. The Group may also be unable to adapt to new or existing technologies to meet customer needs within an appropriate time frame, or a competitor may do so before us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if the Group adopts new technologies in a timely manner as they are developed, the cost of such technology may exceed their benefits. The Group’s inability to obtain the funding or other resources necessary to expand or further upgrade its systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could adversely affect the Group’s ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue. Furthermore, given the pace of at which the Group launches new offers into the market and the multitude of its bundled service offerings, it may experience vulnerability to revenue leakage as a result of the dynamic changes in networks and IT systems. The Group’s revenue chain consists of a complex set of inter-related technologies and processes providing a seamless set of services to the end customer. Although the Group closely monitors the risks related to revenue loss and continuously improves controls in its revenue assurance processes in order to prevent and/or detect cases of revenue leakage, as the set of technologies and business processes grows bigger and more complex, the chance of failure increases in each connection of the revenue chain. Revenue leakage may have an impact on the Group’s ability to bill customers correctly for a given service or to receive the correct payment, which may adversely affect the Group’s margins and profitability. The Group anticipates that, over time, new products and services it may introduce will require upgraded or new customer premises equipment, which may constrain the Group’s ability to market and distribute such new products and services. For example, the Group does not expect that previously installed internet modems or set-top boxes will be able to support all the enhancements the Group may introduce to our broadband internet or pay-TV services over time. A portion of the Group’s subscribers will therefore require some form of upgrade or potentially a replacement of their customer premises equipment. Implementing such upgrades may entail additional costs to us and could delay the introduction of enhanced services and therefore reduce our cash flow and profitability, particularly where customers rent such customer premise equipment from us. In addition, we will need to expend significant capital expenditure to fulfil universal service obligations and to upgrade the parts of our networks that are xDSL. In particular, the Group must also continue to increase and improve the functionality, availability, and characteristics of its network, particularly by improving its bandwidth capacity and its 4G coverage, as well as the introduction of 5G technology, to meet the growing demand for the services that require very-high-speed telephony and internet services as the telecommunications industry in each of the markets in which the Group operates is facing challenges relating to: (i) rapid, significant technological evolution; (ii) frequent improvement of existing products or services resulting from the emergence of new technologies; and (iii) the establishment of new industry practices and standards that make current systems and technologies obsolete. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital to finance such upgrades or that such upgrades will generate a positive return. The Group may also be required to incur additional marketing and customer service costs in order to retain and attract existing customers to any upgraded products and services we offer, as well as to respond to competitors’ advertising pressure, and potentially more extensive marketing campaigns, which may adversely affect our margins.

Generally, fixed-line telephony, mobile and international operators in France are obliged by law to provide interconnection to, and not to discriminate against, any other licensed telecommunications operator. The Group has no control over the quality and timing of the investment and maintenance activities that are necessary for these entities to provide us with interconnection to their respective telecommunications networks. The failure of these or other telecommunications providers to provide reliable interconnections to us on a consistent basis and under terms that are favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of our operations.

See “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Wireless Network _Agreements—Bouygues Telecom Agreement”. This agreement aims to allow the two operators to offer their_ respective customers better geographic coverage and better quality of service, while optimizing costs and investments. The first deliveries of cellular plans occurred on April 30, 2014. It was at that time that each operator first became aware of the deployment plans and technical characteristics of its partner’s sites. The French Competition Authority had prohibited the exchange of technical information prior to the signing of the agreement, and the engineering guidelines had been established on the basis of assumptions that proved to be incorrect in some cases. The discussions that followed upon the initial deliveries of cellular plans led, on October 24, 2014, to adaptation of the agreement and, more specifically, of some engineering choices that had been made at the time when the initial agreement was signed. Prior to its completion, the target date for completing the network was delayed by one year, to account for the time needed to make these adjustments in the target network engineering. The target network is now expected to be completed in 2021. The Group could be exposed to various risks related to the implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement as it will be dependent upon Bouygues Telecom for the part of its network that it is to be responsible for operating. In particular, it will not have any direct operational control over the portion of the network managed by Bouygues Telecom that is to be shared. Therefore, we will not be able to control the quality of the network provided to the customers involved or to implement corrective measures necessary in the event of defect and will be exposed to the risk of failure on the part of Bouygues Telecom. In addition, the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement implemented could also fail to generate the expected synergies, especially in terms of geographic coverage or quality of service. Any delay in its implementation may affect the ability of the Group to achieve the aforementioned objectives of geographic coverage and quality of service. The implementation of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement will also require significant capital expenditures and there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to make a return on such investment or recoup such investment. Further, in the event of partial or total cessation and/or failure of the joint arrangement, the Group would have to redeploy a network in the zones covered up to that time by the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement so as to maintain its geographic coverage and the quality of its services. Such redeployment could represent a major expense for the Group. Moreover, the Group cannot guarantee that it will be able, in such a scenario, to implement coverage equivalent to that enjoyed by customers under the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. The competent authorities may, in the future, make decisions jeopardizing the overall economics and/or validity of the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement. Third parties may also seek to have access to the shared network and take action against the Group and its partner. On April 29, 2014, Orange filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority with regard to the Bouygues Network Sharing Agreement, alleging that it constituted an anti-competitive practice. Investigations on the merits are currently underway. For more information on these ----- proceedings, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings—Civil and Commercial Disputes—Wholesale _Disputes—Orange v. SFR and Bouygues Telecom (Network Sharing Agreement)”. Contract relating to the GSM-R mobile telecommunications network_ The Group holds a 30% minority stake in the company Synérail, which has entered into an agreement for a joint agreement with Réseau Ferré de France (“RFF”) for the design, construction, deployment, operation, maintenance and financing of the GSM-R mobile telecommunications network. See _“Business of the Group—Material _Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements—Agreement Related to the GSM-R Wireless Telecommunications Network”. The GSM-R project aims to set up a private telecommunications network dedicated to the needs of_ professionals in rail transport. It enables a European network to be created having a single communications system that is compatible and harmonized among the rail networks, replacing the existing national radio systems. This contract, with a term of 15 years starting March 24, 2010 and for a total amount of €1 billion, provides for the gradual deployment of this network. The Group is also involved as service provider in the operating phase of the GSM-R network.

Within the framework of our B2C activity, such distribution occurs mainly through our spaces. For indirect distribution of our services, we rely on independent partners, in which we directly or indirectly hold minority stakes. In particular, the French telecommunications market is characterized by rapid change in the habits and needs of customers. Therefore, the Group is committed to adapting its distribution network accordingly in order to respond to new market characteristics. This evolution of the distribution network involves regular adaptation of indirect distribution and thus on the part of all of its independent partners. However, some of them might not have the ability or might not wish to implement the necessary adaptations. In addition, the Group is engaged in significant disputes with former or current partners, particularly demands to re-characterize agreements for joint arrangements as commercial agent agreements, to obtain compensation due to breakdowns in commercial relations, and to invoke the status of management employee, as well as demands from its own employees for recognition of the Group’s status as employer and for application of the employment status applicable inside of the “SFR Social and Economic Unit” (“UES”) convention. The Group has already implemented policies for adapting its contractual tools in order to prevent such risks and manage tailored protective policies, however it cannot guarantee that such claims will not increase or that the factual or legal arguments put forward by the Group to rebut these claims will be received favorably by the courts. In particular, the Group may be obligated to apply its employment status outside its current UES convention.

The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency of electromagnetic fields, linked particularly with the use of cordless phones, as “possibly carcinogenic to humans”, but, to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use. Several lawsuits have been filed against mobile operators and other participants in the mobile industry alleging adverse health effects and other claims relating to radio frequency transmissions to and from sites, handsets and other mobile telecommunications devices. The perception of increased health risks related to mobile network sites may also cause the Group increased difficulty in obtaining leases for new mobile network site locations or renewing leases for existing locations or otherwise in installing mobile telecommunication devices. The fears generated by the potential health risks connected with electromagnetic waves could also lead third parties to act against the Group by, for example, bringing actions demanding the withdrawal of antennas or towers, which could ----- affect the Group’s conduct of operations and the deployment of our network, and could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations. If it is ever determined that health risks existed or that there was a deviation from radiation standards which would result in a health risk from sites, other mobile technology or handsets, this would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including through exposure to potential liability, a reduction in subscribers and reduced usage per subscriber. Furthermore, the Group does not expect to be able to obtain insurance with respect to such liability.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The Group has developed the brands it uses through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions, customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. For a description of the Group’s brands and offers, see “Business of _the Group—Suppliers”._ These brands have been developed through extensive marketing campaigns, website promotions and customer referrals, and the use of a dedicated sales force and dealer networks. The Group’s success depends on its ability to maintain and enhance the image and reputation of its existing products and services and to develop a favorable image and reputation for new products and services. The image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be adversely affected by several factors, including if concerns arise about (i) the quality, reliability and benefit/cost balance of its products and services, (ii) the quality of its support centers or (iii) its ability to deliver the level of service advertised. An event or series of events that threatens the reputation of one or more of the Group’s brands, or one or more of the Group’s products could have an adverse effect on the value of that brand or product and subsequent revenues therefrom. Restoring the image and reputation of the Group’s products and services may be costly and not always possible. The Group relies upon copyright, trademark and patent laws to establish and protect its intellectual property rights, but no assurance can be given that the actions they have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent violation of our intellectual property rights. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of the Group’s brand, which could lead to decreased consumer demand and have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, results of operations or financial condition and prospects. Although we try to manage the Group’s brands, it cannot guarantee that its brands will not be damaged by circumstances that are outside the Group’s control or by third parties such as hackers, sponsorees, or interfaces with its clients, such as subcontractors’ employees or sales forces, with a resulting negative impact on our activities. In particular, the Group’s image is increasingly tied to LaBox and its associated technology, an innovative set-top box which it sources from a third party supplier. A failure on the Group’s part to protect its image, reputation and the brands under which the Group markets our products and services may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

High levels of sovereign debt in the U.S. and certain European countries combined with weak growth and high unemployment could lead to fiscal reforms (including austerity measures), sovereign debt restructurings, currency instability, increased counterparty credit risk, high levels of volatility and, potentially, disruptions in the credit and equity markets as well as other outcomes that might adversely impact our business and financial operations. In Europe, future developments are dependent upon a number of political and economic factors, including the effectiveness of measures by the EU Commission to address debt burdens of certain countries in Europe and the overall stability of the Eurozone. The current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile, and continuing instability in global markets, including instability related to international trade, tariffs, sovereign debt issues, the risk of deflation and the stability of the euro, has contributed to a challenging global economic environment. As France seeks to recover from any natural disasters and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or the French government seeks new sources of revenue due to high fiscal deficit, the government may impose new or increased taxes and levies. Accordingly, ----- our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain or declines further or the government increases taxes or levies as a result of fiscal deficits, pandemics or natural disasters. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors for the equipment (including customer premises equipment, telecommunications equipment, network infrastructure and mobile handsets), software and services that we require in order to provide services to our customers. Our suppliers often conduct business worldwide and their ability to meet our needs is subject to various risks, including political and economic instability, international regulations or sanctions, natural calamities, interruptions in transportation systems or power supplies, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and labor issues. With regard to currency instability issues, concerns exist in the Eurozone with respect to individual macro fundamentals on a country-by-country basis, as well as with respect to the overall stability of the European monetary union and the suitability of a single currency to appropriately deal with specific fiscal management and sovereign debt issues in individual Eurozone countries. Following Brexit on January 31, 2020, the U.K. entered into a transition period set to terminate on December 31, 2020 during which it will continue to apply European Union law. Thereafter, the effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on agreements the U.K negotiates during the transitional period to retain access to markets in the European Union, including current trade and finance agreements. Brexit has created substantial political uncertainty within the European Union, uncertainty in international financial markets and reduced economic growth in certain jurisdictions. It is possible that other members of the European monetary union could hold similar referendums regarding their membership within the Eurozone in the future. The realization of these concerns could lead to the exit of one or more countries from the European monetary union and the re-introduction of individual currencies in these countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro entirely, which could result in the redenomination of a portion or, in the extreme case, all of the Group’s euro-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows to the new currency of the country in which they originated. This could result in a mismatch in the currencies of the Group’s assets, liabilities and cash flows. Any such mismatch, together with the capital market disruption that would likely accompany any such redenomination event, could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s liquidity and financial condition. Furthermore, any redenomination event would likely be accompanied by significant economic dislocation, particularly within the Eurozone countries, which in turn could have an adverse impact on demand for our products and, accordingly, on our revenue and cash flows. Moreover, any changes from euro to non-euro currencies in countries would require the Group to modify its billing and other financial systems. No assurance can be given that any required modifications could be made within a timeframe that would allow the Group to timely bill its customers or prepare and file required financial reports. In light of the significant exposure that the Group has to the euro through its euro-denominated borrowings, derivative instruments, cash balances and cash flows, a redenomination event could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s business. On November 8, 2013, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services downgraded France’s sovereign debt rating by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On December 13, 2014, France was downgraded by Fitch by one notch to AA, where it currently stands. On September 18, 2015, France was downgraded by Moody’s by one notch to Aa2, where it currently stands. There can be no guarantee that there will not be a downgrade of France’s sovereign debt rating in the future. Poor performance of the French economy, particularly due to a possible resurgence of the Eurozone debt crisis, could have a direct negative impact on consumer spending habits and on businesses in relation to products and their usage levels. Such poor performance could (i) make it more difficult for the Group to capture new subscribers and customers, (ii) increase the likelihood that some subscribers or customers of the Group might reduce the level of subscribed services or terminate their subscriptions and (iii) make it more difficult for the Group to keep its prices at current levels. Negative macroeconomic developments in France, in particular increasing levels of unemployment, may have a direct negative impact on the spending patterns of retail consumers, both in terms of the products they subscribe for and usage levels. Because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from residential subscribers who may be impacted by these conditions, it may be more difficult to attract new subscribers and more likely that certain of the Group’s subscribers will downgrade or disconnect their services. In addition, we can provide no assurances that a deterioration of any of these economies will not lead to a higher number of non-paying customers or generally result in service disconnections. Similarly, a deterioration in economic conditions would be likely to adversely affect the demand for, and pricing of, our business services as a result of businesses and governments reducing spending. Therefore, a weak economy and negative economic development in the French markets may jeopardize our growth targets and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and ----- results of operations. In addition, adverse economic conditions (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) may lead to a rise in the number of our customers who are not able to pay for our services.

The severity and timing of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the level and rapidity of infection, duration of the pandemic and related containment measures, changes in consumer spending patterns, measures imposed or taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, macroeconomic conditions in our markets, and negative effects on the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and vendors. Under difficult economic conditions, including prolonged unemployment and employment furloughs, demand for our products and services could decline and some customers may be unable or unwilling to pay for our products and services. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business and/or depending on any restrictions that may be imposed by the French government on deployment of new infrastructure, we may, or may be required to, delay certain capital investments, such as FTTH or in other new initiatives, products or services, which may adversely affect our business in the future. If these events occur and were to continue, our revenue may be reduced materially which could result in reduced operating margins and a reduction in cash flows. Governmental and non-governmental initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of restrictions on work and public gatherings and the promotion of social distancing, along with certain temporary regulations concerning collections, or changes in consumer behaviour, have impacted and could continue to impact our operations and financial results. Even though the strict lockdown in France was lifted on May 11, 2020, significant restrictions and social distancing measures remain in place, which continue to adversely affect the overall French economy and, in turn, our operations. If a significant portion of our workforce is unable to work effectively due to prolonged illness, quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government actions, facility closures or other reasons in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations could be further materially impacted. Our suppliers and vendors also may be affected by such measures in their ability to provide products and services to us and these measures could also make it more difficult for us to serve our customers. It is unclear whether measures taken by the French government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in France are adequate and will be effective in achieving their goals. It is unclear when, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic will be contained. We have implemented enhanced health and safety measures in our operations in line with public health rules and guidelines and industry practices to combat the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the increase in costs associated with the implementation of such measures, we are also exposed to the risk of an increase in the number of workplace and third-party claims arising from actual or alleged failures to implement such measures adequately, or at all, and a potential increase in legal, advisory and other costs as a result of any COVID-19 pandemic related claims from workers or third party customers and suppliers that may come into contact with our operations. Financial markets have been experiencing extreme fluctuations that may cause a contraction in available liquidity globally as important segments of the markets react to the development. The pandemic may lead to a decline in business and consumer confidence and presents the risk of an economic recession in France and around the globe, which could adversely impact our results. Further, political repercussions of responses to the COVID-19 pandemic by European Union institutions as well as by other countries in the European Union could have complex and hard-to-predict consequences for the future, including a destabilization of the European Union or its institutions or a slow-down or reversal of European integration.

These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered by our management to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time. These estimates and assumptions form the basis of judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. Areas requiring more complex judgments may shift over time based on changes business mix and industry practice which could affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. In addition, management’s judgments, estimates and assumptions and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses may be affected by changes in accounting policy. In January 2016, the IASB issued a new standard coming into effect on January 1, 2019, IFRS 16 (Leases), which has superseded the current standard (IAS 17) and its current interpretations. IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a sufficiently low value. IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method, with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of the initial application. IFRS 16 had a significant impact on our consolidated statement of financial position from periods beginning on January 1, 2019, due to the recognition of rights-of-use related to leased assets and corresponding lease liabilities. Moreover, our consolidated statement of profit or loss was impacted as operating lease expenses no longer comprise a part of operating expenses, but instead fall under depreciation and interest expenses. The Group’s consolidated statement of cash flows was also impacted given that payment for lease liabilities is now presented within financing activities. The principal effects of the application of IFRS 16 on our consolidated statement of financial position and results of operations as of January 1, 2019, were a recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of €3,233 million which include the lease assets in the amount of €121 million previously recognized under finance leases and reclassified from the property, plant and equipment and intangible assets line items, and an increase in lease liabilities by €3,214 million, of which the current and non-current liabilities increased by €663 million and €2,551 million, respectively. The Group has completed its assessment of IFRS 16 with respect to subsurfacing rights and has concluded that in its relevant contracts, the suppliers have a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use and therefore, such contracts do not constitute a lease. For further details on new accounting standards that may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements, see note 1.2 to the 2019 Financial Statements and note 1.2 to the Unaudited Financial Statements, in each case, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of daily EURIBOR or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of ongoing national and international regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the “FCA Announcement”). The FCA Announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021.

See “Description of Other Indebtedness—Term _Loans” and “Description of Other Indebtedness—Revolving Credit Facilities”. Various interest rate benchmarks_ (including LIBOR) are the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. Some reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented, including the EU Benchmark Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/1011). In addition, the sustainability of LIBOR has been questioned by the FCA as a result of the absence of relevant active underlying markets and possible disincentives (including possibly as a result of regulatory reforms) for market participants to continue contributing to such benchmarks. On November 29, 2017, the Bank of England and the FCA announced that the market Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Rates would have an extended mandate to catalyze a broad transition to the Sterling Over Night Index Average rate (“SONIA”) across sterling bond, loan and derivatives markets so that SONIA is established as the primary sterling interest rate benchmark by the end of 2021. The Bank of England and FCA have stated that a key near-term priority for the Working Group will be to make recommendations relating to the potential development of term SONIA reference rates. These reforms and other pressures may cause such benchmarks to disappear entirely, to perform differently than in the past (as a result of a change in methodology or otherwise), create disincentives for market participants to continue to administer or participate in certain benchmarks or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Based on the foregoing, investors should in particular be aware that: - any of the reforms or pressures described above or any other changes to a relevant interest rate benchmark (including LIBOR) could affect the level of the published rate, including to cause it to be lower and/or more volatile than it would otherwise be; and - if LIBOR is discontinued, then the rate of interest applicable to the Group’s sources of funding may be determined for a period by applicable fall-back provisions, although such provisions, often being dependent in part upon the provision by reference banks of offered quotations for the LIBOR rate, may not operate as intended (depending on market circumstances and the availability of rates information at the relevant time) and may in certain circumstances result in the effective application of a fixed rate based on the rate which applied in the previous period when LIBOR was available. More generally, any of the above matters or any other significant change to the setting or existence of LIBOR could affect the Group’s ability to meet our obligations under the Group’s sources of funding and/or could have a material adverse effect on the liquidity of, and the amount payable under, the Group’s sources of funding. See also “—The Group is exposed to interest rate risks. Shifts in such rates may adversely affect the Group’s debt _service obligations.” Changes in the manner of administration of LIBOR could result in adjustments to the_ conditions applicable to the Group’s sources of funding or other consequences relevant to the Group’s sources of funding. No assurance can be provided that changes will not be made to LIBOR or any other relevant benchmark rate and/or that such benchmarks will continue to exist.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The primary transactional currency of the Group is euro and most of the Group’s revenues and operating cash flows are in euro. The Group conducts, and will continue to conduct, transactions in currencies other than such primary transactional currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar. A significant portion of the Group’s existing debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. The Group has historically covered a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed obligations through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Further, while we manage the risk of certain currency fluctuations in respect of a portion of our existing debt and to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes in respect of indebtedness linked to interest rates, these arrangements may be costly and may not insulate us completely from such exposure. There can be no ----- guarantee that our hedging strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuation or changes in interest rates, or that these hedges will not limit any benefit that we might otherwise receive from favorable movements in exchange rates or interest rates.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

It is not possible to predict how disruptions in the credit and equity markets and the associated difficult economic conditions could impact our future financial position. In this regard, (i) the financial failures of any of the Group’s counterparties could (a) reduce amounts available under committed credit facilities and (b) adversely impact the Group’s ability to access cash deposited with any failed financial institution and (ii) sustained or further tightening of the credit markets could adversely impact the Group’s ability to access debt financing on favorable terms, or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed herein and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes. A downgrade in our credit rating may negatively affect the Group’s ability to obtain future financing to fund our operations and capital needs, which may affect our liquidity. It may also increase our financing costs by increasing the interest rates of our outstanding debt or the interest rates at which it is able to refinance existing debt or incur additional debt. There can be no assurance that the Group’s corporate rating, or the instrument rating with respect to the Notes, will be maintained at existing levels. See “—Risks Relating to the Notes—Credit ratings may not _reflect all risks”._ Because the financial condition, revenues and profitability of our operating subsidiaries are closely linked to the economies of their countries of operations, we expect that the Group as a whole will also be impacted by any downgrading in the sovereign debt rating of such countries.

Such regulation and supervision, as well as future changes in laws or regulations or in their interpretation or enforcement that affect us, our competitors or our industry, strongly influence how we operate our business. Complying with existing and future law and regulations may increase our operational and administrative expenses, restrict the Group’s ability or make it more difficult to implement price increases, affect the Group’s ability to introduce new services, force us to change our marketing and other business practices, and/or otherwise limit our revenues. In particular, our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable conditions for other operators or increasing competition. There can be no assurance to you that the provision of our services will not be subject to greater regulation in the future. Furthermore, a failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations could result in penalties, restrictions on our business or loss of required licenses or other adverse consequences. Although the regulations applicable to our business vary, such regulations may include, amongst other things: - price regulation for certain of the services we offer, exit fees and cancellation charges; - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection rates that we can charge and that we pay; - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or obtain consent to carry a broadcast station; - rules for authorizations, licensing, acquisitions, renewals and transfers of licenses and franchises; - requirements that we provide or contribute to the provision of certain universal services; - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy and data protection; ----- - rules and regulations relating to our networks, including universal access obligations imposed on us, coinstallation and co-location obligations (including our submarine cable landing stations), right of way and ownership considerations; - rules governing the copyright royalties; requirements on portability; and - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as equal employment opportunity, emergency alert systems, disability access, technical standards, environmental standards, city planning rules and customer service and consumer protection requirements. The regulations applicable to our operations within the EU often derive from EU Directives. The various Directives require EU Member States to harmonize their laws on communications and cover such issues as access, user rights, privacy and competition. These Directives are reviewed by the EU from time to time and any changes to them could lead to substantial changes in the way in which our business is regulated and to which we would have to adapt. In addition, the Group is subject to antitrust rules and regulations and are, from time to time, subject to review by authorities concerning whether we exhibit monopoly power in any of the market in which we operate. To the extent that the Group is deemed by relevant authorities to exhibit significant market power, we can be subject to various regulatory obligations adversely affecting our results of operations and profitability. Regulatory authorities may also require the Group to grant third parties access to our bandwidth, frequency capacity, facilities or services to distribute their own services or resell our services to end customers. Currently, the Group is considered to have significant market power in France. No assurance can be given that we will not be identified as having significant market power in the future and we will not be subject to additional regulatory requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,13.3.2,Future regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business.,"The Group is subject to the provisions of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (“CPCE”), which imposes certain general obligations on all operators and certain specific obligations on mobile operators. The French regulatory framework applicable to operators is also subject to the analysis of the relevant markets carried out by the French telecom regulator (“ARCEP”) which is charged with (i) defining the relevant markets in France, (ii) analyzing the markets or identifying the companies reputed for exercising significant influence on these markets and (iii) deciding whether or not to impose on these companies regulatory obligations to remedy the effects of such influence. The Group is not considered by ARCEP to be an operator deemed to have significant influence over a relevant market, except over the markets for voice-call termination on its fixed and mobile networks. Nevertheless, it cannot be guaranteed that the Group, in the future, will not be identified by ARCEP as an operator deemed to exercise significant power in one or more relevant markets, and that ARCEP will not therefore impose additional regulatory obligations in this regard. For example, the possibility cannot be excluded that, in the future, particularly in the context of a growth in FTTH networks, the Group may be required to grant competitors some access to its fiber optic network, under conditions to be determined. At the request of the French Competition Authority, ARCEP has recently issued an opinion addressing the issues raised by the digital revolution currently affecting the audiovisual sector (ARCEP opinion dated October 11, 2018). In this document, ARCEP provided an overview of audiovisual content broadcasting techniques (DTT, copper and fiber networks, satellite, OTT and cable networks) before detailing the sector’s recent evolutions at both the operator and consumer ends, emphasizing the necessity to determine a common technical framework for these new services. ARCEP has not provided a timeline for the determination of such framework and has recommended the implementation of a horizontal regulation for all devices allowing access to audiovisual content. As the technical framework develops, the Group may be subject to ongoing obligations. The Group is also subject to other individual obligations resulting from the approvals to use frequencies. See “— _The Group can only operate its business for as long as it has licenses from the relevant authorities and it may not be able to obtain, retain or review the licenses and authorizations necessary for conducting its activities.”_ In September 2017, the French government asked ARCEP to begin work on the binding commitments that mobile operators were likely to make, above and beyond their existing rollout plans. Based on ARCEP’s proposals, and as part of a dialogue with mobile network operators, the French Government reached an agreement that aims to ----- ensure the availability of a high standard of mobile coverage for every person in France. With respect to these elements, mobile operators have committed to: - improving reception quality across the entire country, and particularly in rural areas. The new baseline quality standard applied to operators’ obligations will be that of “good coverage”; - increasing the pace of targeted programmes for improving coverage, with each operator deploying at least 5,000 new cell sites across the country to this end, some of which will be shared, which will henceforth go beyond so-called “white areas” and for which operators will now be fully responsible. Over the next three years, we will bring coverage to as many areas as the total number covered by government programmes over the past fifteen years. Government authorities will work closely with local authorities to identify the areas that need to be covered; - achieving ubiquitous 4G coverage, which will mean bringing it to more than a million additional people in 10,000 municipalities in France, by making every cell site 4G-capable; - accelerating the coverage of transportation routes, so that all of the major roads and railways have 4G coverage. The agreement also provides for coverage on regional railway lines; and - achieving ubiquitous indoor telephone coverage, notably by using voice over Wi-Fi. Facilitated by an increase of network sharing which ensures more efficient rollouts, along with a planned simplification of the measures contained in the new housing bill, stepping up the pace of deployment for new mobile phone equipment will significantly improve the user experience of mobile coverage in every part of the country. On July 3, 2018, ARCEP handed down a decision (decision no. 2018-0684) setting out the conditions under which licenses for 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2100 GHz-band frequencies may be granted in 2021, 2022 and 2024. One of these conditions is that operators are required to take actions to achieve the goals set out in Articles L. 32 et seq. of the CPCE (digital development of the French territory, fair and effective competition between operators on the mobile market and effective management and use of the frequency spectrum). Mobile operator frequency licences granted in July 2018 are now binding and a failure to meet these new obligations will result in sanctions from ARCEP. On June 4, 2019, ARCEP updated its mobile new deal roadmap underlining the priority of deploying and/or enhancing the quality of mobile coverage on highways and other strategic transport networks. On July 12, 2019, a new decree regarding network coverage obligations was passed. This decree identifies specific interests locations (strategic sites) that must be covered by mobile networks or in which the quality of the services provided must be improved by the operators. The decree no. 2019-1592 of December 31, 2019, initiated the 5G public tender and the ministerial decree of December 30, 2019 determined modalities and conditions for the tender. 31 frequencies in the 10 MHz band will be allocated as follows: - Four blocks of 50 MHz are expected to be allocated at a set price provided the operators agree on several commitments detailed in the tender specifications; and - The remaining frequencies will be allocated through an auction process, per blocks of 10 MHz. SFR, Orange, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom have agreed to obtain one of the four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each). On April 2, 2020, ARCEP announced that: - the four candidates were qualified; ----- - the four candidates had made the commitments set out in the specifications, and each will be able to obtain a block of 50 MHz at the end of this procedure, for the sum of €350 million. The four candidates are now authorised to participate in the auction stage, during which the 11 blocks of 10 MHz that remain available in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band will be awarded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main auction to award the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz have been postponed. Their allocation is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. The Group monitors the regulations to which it is subject; however, the weight of the regulatory burden on “electronic” telecommunications operators, including the Group, may change and may lead to the application of different obligations in their regard depending on the level of ownership of direct access networks and the level of market power that may be more or less significant to or constrictive upon certain operators by virtue of changes in the technology used for providing services. If the Group becomes subject to regulations relatively more constrictive than its competitors, this could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position. Furthermore, as an “electronic” telecommunications operator and a distributor of television services, the Group is subject to special taxes. The burden of such taxes could increase in the future due to changes in legislation. In addition, the Group cannot guarantee that additional taxes will not be instituted in the telecommunications industry. Any future restrictions on the Group’s ability to market its products or services in the way it wishes could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial position.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,13.3.3,The European Commission’s “Digital Single Market” legislation could adversely affect the Group’s businesses.,"The EU Regulation 531/2012, which initially set a rate for roaming, was further amended through the regulation 2015/2120 of 25/11/2015 to establish the conditions and the viability of a removal of retail roaming charges from June 15, 2017 (“roam like at home” subject to fair-usage). Moreover, the regulation introduces measures relating to “net neutrality”. Furthermore, the roaming regulation was completed by other pieces of legislation: - Implementing regulation EU 2016/2286 of 15/12/2016 laying down detailed rules on the application of fair use policy and on the methodology for assessing the sustainability of the abolition of retail roaming surcharges and on the application to be submitted by a roaming provider for the purposes of that assessment; and - Regulation UE 2017/920 of 17/05/2017 amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 with respect to rules for wholesale roaming markets. The Commission’s proposals on telecommunications markets presented in September 2016 intends to fix rules to support the creation of Gigabit Society. The electronic communications code proposal aims to make investment in very high capacity networks a binding objective and it also aims to promote sustainable long term competition. It was adopted through Directive 2018/1972 of December 11, 2018 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”), which entered into force on December 20, 2018. This legislation is expected to have both a positive and adverse effect on revenue generated from the Group’s operations due to anticipated price decreases, higher operational costs and increased competition. All of these factors may adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (i) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (ii) associated facilities and services, (iii) the authorisation of networks and services, (iv) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (v) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (vi) the protection of end-users. It aims to: - Promote connectivity, access to and take-up of very high capacity networks by all citizens and businesses of the EU; - Promote competition in the provision of electronic communication networks and services; ----- - Contribute to the development of the internal market in the field of electronic communications networks and services, radio spectrum, and connectivity; and - Promote the interests of European citizens. The EECC has singled out citizen connectivity as a key objective for the EU, since it is instrumental in guaranteeing freedom of expression, pluralism, democracy, culture, social cohesion, and even safety. The EECC also adopts a broader definition of ECS to regulate services delivered via internet (known as “over-the-top” or “OTT” services). ECS now includes internet access services, interpersonal communications services (“ICS”), and services consisting wholly or mainly in the conveyance of signals. The EECC also provides for strategic planning and coordination of a radio spectrum policy, as well as for effective management of radio spectrum by Member States. Finally, national regulation authorities are responsible for ensuring access, interconnection, and the interoperability of services. Consequently, and under certain circumstances, they can impose on undertakings obligations such as interconnecting networks, ensuring the interoperability of their services and granting physical access to their infrastructure. A public concertation was initiated on December 2019 with regard to the transposition into French national law of the EECC. The concertation covers the following topics: - the maximum duration of the contracts between customers and service providers, - framing the conditions under which bundled offers (mobile phone and plan) can be offered to the customers, - the regulation of added value services, - the termination conditions (to ensure that termination provisions do not carry any deterrent effect), and - the conditions under which service providers who refuse to respect the provisions of the EECC (number portability, change of operator, etc.) can be sanctioned. Member States must enact the EECC into their national laws by December 21, 2020. As of the date hereof, France has not yet enacted EECC into its national laws.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,13.3.4,The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals.,"The legal status of the Group’s network is complex and the network is mainly governed by public law, which could affect the predictability of the Group’s rights over its network. For a description of the legal status of the Group’s cable network see “Regulation—Legal Status of Networks”. The Group’s telecommunications network is essentially composed of the physical infrastructure (conduits, network head-ends, switches and radio frequency stations) in which telecommunications (mainly cable) equipment is installed. These components of the Group’s network are subject to different legal regimes. As the Group does not own certain land where such physical infrastructures are located and infrastructure is established on public or private property, it has entered into concessions, rights-of-way, leases or even IRUs with the owners of the land. In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly, from 3 to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. ----- If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved. If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

These authorizations generally require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations, meet certain solvency requirements and maintain minimum levels of service. Should the Group fail to comply with these, it may be subject to financial penalties from the relevant authorities and there may also be a risk that licenses could be partially or totally withdrawn. The imposition of fines and/or the withdrawal of licenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and prevent us from conducting the Group’s business. In addition, such authorizations are generally granted for fixed terms and must be periodically renewed. The procedure for obtaining or renewing these licenses can be long and costly and authorities often demand concessions or other commitments as a condition for renewal. In addition, these licenses may not be obtainable or renewable in a timely manner or at all. In some instances, such authorizations have not been renewed at expiration, and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreements or without an authorization while negotiating renewal terms with the local franchising authorities. Should we not be able to obtain or renew the licenses needed to operate or develop our business in a timely fashion, the Group’s ability to realize our strategic objectives may be compromised. In certain cases the Group’s mobile licenses require it to comply with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in certain areas, national roaming) and the Group may suffer adverse consequences if is not able to comply with these obligations. In certain countries, we have provided significant bank guarantees to guarantee our performance under our licenses. If the Group is found to be in material breach of our licenses, the guarantees may be forfeited and our licenses may be revoked. Some of the Group’s activities depend on obtaining or renewing licences issued by regulatory authorities, particularly ARCEP in the telecommunications field and CSA in the audiovisual field. Under the licences allocated to the Group’s subsidiaries, the latter have committed themselves to complying with certain obligations (population coverage, sharing in some areas, roaming allowance). The Group is required to deploy a 3G and 4G generation radio network adhering to certain rates of coverage for the metropolitan population according to a given timetable. Within the framework of its 4G licences, if certain conditions are met, the Group will eventually have to allow Free Mobile roaming on a portion of its 4G network. The Group will also have to provide coverage, in conjunction with other 800 MHz band holders and under its 2G licence, for the city centers identified under the “white zones” plan, and accede to reasonable requests for network sharing in a priority deployment zone. The Group will also have to accede to reasonable requests to allow MVNOs throughout its very-high-speed mobile network open to the public in Metropolitan France. A failure to adhere to any one of these commitments could put the Group at risk under its regulatory obligations and possibly expose it to penalties (fines, total or partial suspension or withdrawal of licence). This could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group. To provide the Group’s various stakeholders with certainty over the future of some spectrum resources and with a view to issuing a call for applications that will enable a reallocation of longstanding 2G and 3G frequency bands for a period of 10 years (the licences relating to which will begin to expire in 2021), ARCEP has laid the ground rules for public consultation on the terms and conditions for such reallocation in its decision no. 2018-0684. The frequencies concerned are the frequencies in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands that were allocated to Orange, the Group and Bouygues Telecom in 2006 and 2009 for 15 years, and the 2.1 GHz band frequencies allocated to these same three operators in 2001 and 2002 for 20 years. Some of the existing 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz frequency licences for Metropolitan France are set to expire in 2021, 2022 and 2024. The terms for allocating frequencies seek to satisfy two main goals: digital regional development and achieving fair and effective competition between operators. The call for applications procedures for the allocation of 900, 1800 and 2100 MHz band frequencies took into account the goal of ensuring fair and effective competition in the mobile market by implementing the conditions needed to ensure that all mobile operators have fair and equal access to spectrum. It has been approved by the Minister responsible for electronic communications who launched the allocation procedure in early August 2018. The licences were awarded by ARCEP on November 15, 2018, and the frequencies will be made available starting in 2021. ----- The acquisition of licences also represents a high cost, the timing of which varies depending on when the frequencies involved are auctioned. Furthermore, this cost could rise due to strong competitive pressure in the telecommunications field. If we fail to obtain or retain, in a timely manner, the licences necessary for performing, continuing or developing our activities, the Group’s ability to achieve our strategic objectives could be subjected to alteration. In addition, the Group may fail to be awarded the desired licences, which could have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial position, results of operations or outlook.

Significant portions of those physical facilities occupy public rights of way and are subject to governmental regulations. Other portions occupy private property under express or implied easements or pursuant to leases, and many miles of the cable are attached to utility poles governed by pole attachment agreements or other commercial arrangements. No assurances can be given that we will be able to maintain and use our facilities in their current locations and at their current costs. Changes in governmental regulations or changes in these relationships could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s business and results of operations. In particular, the legal status of the Group’s network is complex, mainly governed by public and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals.

In order to establish a substantial part of its telecommunications network and of its wireless network, the Group has thus entered into public and private property occupancy agreements with public and private entities or holds public property occupancy permits. Under these agreements or permits, the Group may install its network equipment along roads, highways, railways or canals, for example. No transfer of ownership takes place within this framework. Such agreements are entered into for terms that vary greatly in duration from three to 25 years. The Group does not have any right to renewal of such agreements, although the agreements with the shortest terms generally provide for tacit renewal. The Group’s occupancy of public property, as is the case for all occupants of public property, is always precarious and subject to considerations beyond the Group’s control. The public entities with which the Group has entered into these agreements or that have issued permits to it can thus at any time terminate these public property occupancy agreements for misconduct or for reasons of public interest and some of the agreements even exclude any compensation in such case. If the Group fails to obtain such renewal, the company involved would be obliged, upon expiration of these agreements, (i) to return the site to its original condition upon the demand of the manager or owner of the public property involved and/or (ii) to transfer to the latter, in certain cases for the payment of compensation and in certain cases free of charge, ownership of the facilities established on the property involved. If the Group loses all or part of the rights relating to its network, it could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial position, results of operations or outlook of the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,13.3.7,The Group is subject to requirements in terms of protection of personal data and data security.,"Within the context of our business activities, we must collect and process personal data. In the EU, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted the regulation on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation, the “GDPR”) on April 27, 2016. The GDPR has been directly applicable in all EU member states since May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC and current national data protection legislation in member states, and was implemented in the EEA countries with effect from the same date. The GDPR significantly changes the EU/EEA data protection landscape, including strengthening of individuals’ rights, stricter requirements on companies processing personal data and stricter sanctions with substantial administrative fines. The GDPR also offers data subjects the option to let a privacy organization litigate on their behalf, including collecting the potential damages. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined ----- €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), British Airways and Marriott were provisionally fined £183 million and £99 million, respectively by the UK authority (ICO), and many cases are currently under investigation). The Group does business in the hosting of data relating to the health of individuals, which subjects us to the specific obligations provided for by the Public Health Code such as obtaining and maintaining authorization or certification for the hosting of such data. If we breach our obligations or fail to adhere to the requirements applicable to sensitive data processing, the Group may be subjected to criminal and financial penalties likely to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. In its judgment on October 6, 2015 (known as the “Schrems Judgment”), the European Court of Justice overturned the decision by the European Commission that the transfer of European personal data to the United States under the “Safe Harbor” framework provides an adequate level of protection. The successor “Privacy Shield” agreement negotiated by representatives of the EU and the United States have been overturned by a judgment of the European Court of Justice of July 16, 2020 (case C-311/18, known as “Schrems II”) which could impact our business and results. In 2016, the CJEU further clarified what safeguards are required for data retention to be lawful. In the case of Tele2 Sverige and Home Secretary v. Watson, the court concluded that Member States cannot impose a general obligation on providers of electronic telecommunications services to retain data, but did not ban data retention altogether. Such retention is compatible with EU law if deployed against specific targets to fight serious crime. Retention measures must be necessary and proportionate regarding the categories of data to be retained, the means of communication affected, the persons concerned and the chosen duration of retention. Furthermore, national authorities’ access to the retained data must be conditional and meet certain data protection safeguards. New data retention rules are currently being discussed at an EU level in response to this decision. In the case of Breyer, the CJEU concluded that Internet Protocol addresses may constitute personal data where the individual concerned can be identified, even where a third party must obtain additional data for the identification to take place. The CJEU also held that website operators may rely on a legitimate interest as a legal basis when retaining and using their visitors’ personal data. This is of major importance for data retention rules; it follows that online media service providers can lawfully store their visitors’ personal data to pursue a legitimate interest, rather than just for the purposes previously outlined in the invalidated Data Retention Directive. Thus, the grounds justifying data retention have become broader. The French legal framework for data protection has been gradually brought in line with the GDPR and the Police and Justice Directive. The French Data Protection Law of January 6, 1978 (Law no. 78-17), was amended by Law no. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018 and its implementing decree, and by decree no. 2018-687 of August 1, 2018. Such Law was rewritten and made consistent with GDPR by Order no. 2018-1225 of December 12, 2018. Finally, a new decree implementing the Law, no. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019 came into force on June 1, 2019. The French legal framework for data protection has now been stabilised. It imposes obligations on companies processing personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment in France concerning the conditions in which such a company may process personal data of individuals, the obtaining of their consent with respect to such processing (especially for the use of cookies) and carrying out the necessary measures for disclosure and transfer of data outside of the EU. Any breach of these obligations may lead to criminal and administrative financial penalties against us and damage to our reputation. On June 28, 2019, the French data protection authority (CNIL) announced new guidelines on the use of cookies for direct marketing purposes (online targeted advertisement), ruling out the use of implied or “soft” consent to place cookies on users’ devices. To assist companies in complying with these new rules, the CNIL published a draft recommendation on cookies on January 14, 2020 and the new legal regime applicable in France regarding cookies should be stabilised by the end of 2020. Regardless of the measures we adopt to protect the confidentiality, security of data and respect the rights of the people whose data we process, there remains the risk of possible attacks or breaches of data processing systems, which could give rise to penalties and damage our reputation. The Group could be compelled to incur additional costs in order to protect against these risks or to mitigate the consequences thereof, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations or outlook. Furthermore, any loss of confidence on the part of our customers as a result of such events could lead to a significant decline in sales and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

However, our intellectual property rights or those of our licensors could be challenged or invalidated, we could have difficulty protecting or obtaining such rights or the rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of business opportunities, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive harm. The Group has received, and may receive in the future, claims of infringement or misappropriation of other parties’ proprietary rights, particularly creative rights with respect to broadcasted programs. In addition to claims relating to broadcasts on channels which the Group owns, it may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims with respect to programs broadcast on the other channels, including foreign channels that it carries. Moreover, the telecommunications industry is characterized by a high concentration of intellectual property rights, which increases the risk of litigation resulting from our activities upon the grounds of prior rights of third parties. Therefore, the Group is particularly exposed to the risk of proceedings initiated by patent trolls. See “—The Group _may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims by “patent trolls”.”_ Any such claims may require the Group to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Successful challenges to our rights to intellectual property or claims of infringement of a third party’s intellectual property could require the Group to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be temporarily or permanently prohibited from further use of the intellectual property in question. This could require the Group to change our business practices and limit the Group’s ability to provide our customers with the content that they expect. Even if we believe that the claims of intellectual property infringement are without merit, defending against the claims can be time consuming and costly and may divert management’s attention and resources away from our business. An inability on our part to effectively protect certain important elements of our intellectual property rights and of our technology could have a material adverse effect on our activities, financial position, results of operations or outlook.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Some of the proceedings against us may involve claims for considerable amounts and may require that our general management devote time to addressing such issues, to the detriment of managing the business. In addition, such proceedings may result in substantial damages and/or may impair our reputation, which may result in a decline in the demand for our services which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The outcome of these proceedings and claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, our results of operations or our cash flows during the years when such disputes are decided or the sums potentially involved in them are paid. The Group may also be exposed to proceedings that could involve our independent distributor partners, as well as other telecommunications operators which are so exposed. The Group is currently involved in number of disputes and proceedings referred to in “Business of the Group— _Legal Proceedings”. The costs that may result from these lawsuits are only accrued when it is more likely than_ not that a liability, resulting from past events, will be incurred and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of the provisions recorded in the Unaudited Financial Statements of the Group as of June 30, 2020 in respect of lawsuits amounted to €85 million in the aggregate, based on a case by case assessment of the risk level of each individual lawsuit, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. The Group’s assessment of risk is based both on the advice of legal counsel and on our estimate of the probable settlement amounts that are expected to be incurred, ----- if such a settlement would be agreed by both parties.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,13.3.11,The Group is subject to risk or litigation in the event of defective software or a claim by a third party as to software ownership.,"In contrast to more traditional licences of standard (so-called “proprietary”) software, users of open source software (“OSS”) are generally permitted by the licensor to access, copy, modify and distribute the underlying source code. Such broad rights (such as in the GNU General Public Licence) are usually subject to the requirement that users not place any additional restrictions on access to the source code in any onward distribution of the software, and that such onward licensing be on the original licence terms. OSS is commonly viewed as having two major risks. First, the OSS licence usually also covers onward distributions of derivative works (based on the original OSS), with the result that proprietary software integrated with the OSS becomes “infected” and the entire integrated software program (OSS and proprietary software components) is covered by the OSS licence. One notable result of this is that the publisher or distributor of the derivative work would have to make available the source code of the entire work, including the proprietary software portions. The second commonly viewed risk is that OSS software is usually licenced “as is” without any contractual warranties. As a result, the Group would bear the risks in the event of defects with any OSS that the Group utilizes in its products and services without necessarily having any contractual recourse. Further, if the Group integrates OSS into any of the software that it publishes or distributes, then the use by the Group of OSS could have an impact on the ownership of the intellectual property in such software, particularly in terms of exclusivity, as the refusal to disclose any modifications made could be characterized as an infringement of the OSS licence. Moreover, the Group cannot rule out any risk of a request for disclosure or the request by a third party to access the modifications of the source code performed on such software.

As a result, the Group may face increases in taxes payable if tax rates increase, or if tax laws and regulations are modified by the competent authorities in an adverse manner. In addition, the tax authorities in France periodically examine our activities. Any change in local or international tax rules, for example prompted by the implementation of the OECD’s recommendations on Base Erosion and Profits Shifting (a global initiative to improve the fairness and integrity of tax systems), or new challenges by tax authorities, may have an adverse effect on the Group’s tax positions and its financial results. Any changes may also affect the return on an investors’ investment in the Group and result in changes in personal tax rates and tax relief. The Group has structured its commercial and financial activities in compliance with various regulatory obligations to which it is subject, as well as in line with our commercial and financial objectives. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax positions, including, amongst others, corporate income tax and value added tax (“VAT”). In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. To the extent that the laws and regulations of the various countries in which our companies are located or operate do not establish clear or definitive provisions, the tax treatment applied to our activities or our intra ----- group reorganizations is sometimes based on interpretations of the applicable tax regulations. The Group cannot guarantee that such interpretations will not be called into question by the competent tax administrations, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of our operations More generally, any breach of the tax regulations and laws of the countries in which our companies are located or operate could result in adjustments or the payment of late fees, fines or penalties. The French tax authorities have reassessed the application of VAT rates on certain multi-play offerings for fiscal years 2011 to 2016. The Group is disputing all of the proposed reassessments and has initiated appeals and dispute proceedings, which are at different stages for each of the years subject to reassessments. For more details, see “Business of the Group—Legal Proceedings— _Tax Audits”._ In addition, tax laws and regulations could change and could be subject to changes in their interpretation and in the application thereof. In particular, in the current macroeconomic environment, governmental authorities could decide to increase tax rates, to eliminate existing tax exemptions, to expand tax bases, or to introduce new taxes. As a result, we could undergo an increase in our tax burden if tax rates rise or if legislation or the interpretation thereof by the administration changes. In particular, the Group is exposed to the risk of a further increase in the VAT (and / or sectorial taxes such as turnover taxes on electronic communications operators) and might not be able to pass along such increase, in full or in part, through subscription prices, and this would then have a negative impact on overall revenue. Furthermore, any such increase in subscription prices would expose the Group to a risk of an increased churn rate from of its existing subscribers and could limit the recruitment of new subscribers.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters,13.3.15,"French tax rules could limit the ability of the Group to deduct interest for tax purposes, thus reducing the net cash position of the Group.","As a general rule, pursuant to Article 39,1-1° of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts) (“FTC”), expenses incurred by a French company are deductible provided, among other conditions, that (i) they are incurred in its direct corporate interest and (ii) they correspond to actual and justified expenses. In this respect, French case law has developed the concept of “abnormal act of management”, according to which the expenses incurred by a French company in relation with transactions that are not aligned with its direct corporate interest are not tax deductible. Given the complex intragroup transactions within the Group, the risk that the French Tax Authorities might try to challenge the deductibility of interest expenses resulting from intragroup financings (e.g., interest expenses on an intragroup loan), considering that such transactions (i) are not performed in the direct corporate interest of the French company of the Group at the level of which these interest expenses are incurred or (ii) have not been set at arm’s length conditions, cannot be excluded. Under Article 39.1.3° of the FTC, the deduction of interest paid by a French company to lenders who are direct shareholders of such company but are not related parties to such company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC, is subject to the conditions that (i) the share capital of the borrowing company is fully paid-in and (ii) the interest rate on the corresponding loans does not exceed a rate equal to the annual average rate of floating rate loans granted by financial establishments for a minimum term of two years (1.32% with respect to fiscal years closed on December 31, 2019). By exception, pursuant to Article 212, I-(a) of the FTC, the deductibility of interest ----- paid on loans granted by a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC is deductible within the limit of the interest that would have resulted from the application of the maximum tax rate computed as per Article 39, 1-3° of the FTC, or, if higher, from the rate that the borrower could have obtained from independent financial establishments in similar conditions. Pursuant to Article 39.12 of the FTC, two entities will be regarded as related if (i) one of the entities holds directly or indirectly the majority of the other entity’s share capital or actually exercises the power of decision in that entity or (ii) both entities are placed under the conditions defined in (i) to the control of a same third entity. In both of the above mentioned cases of interest and deductibility limitation, non-deductible expenses might be recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the FTC, which may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC, at a rate of (i) 28% (such rate will be lowered to 26,5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and to 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022 in order to be aligned on the French standard corporate income tax rate) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents or (ii) 75% for payments made in non-cooperative jurisdictions within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the FTC other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of the same Article 238-0 A, subject in any case to the more favorable provisions of an applicable double tax treaty. The French Finance Law for 2020 introduced new Articles 205 B, 205 C and 205 D in the FTC in order to implement under French tax law the provisions of the Council Directive (EU) 2017/952 of May 29, 2017 (the “ATAD 2”) on hybrid mismatches. These new rules aim at challenging hybrid and residency mismatches (the “Hybrid Mismatch Rules”) and replace the former anti-hybrid limitation that was set out by Article 212 I, b) of the FTC (pursuant to which the deductibility of interest paid on loans granted by a related party – within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC – was subject to the requirement that the lender was, for the current year and with respect to concerned interest, subject to an income tax in an amount which was at least equal to 25% of the corporate income tax determined under standard French tax rules). Most of the Hybrid Mismatch Rules apply as from fiscal years starting on or after January 1, 2020 (consequently, Article 212 I-b of the FTC has been repealed from January 1, 2020). In substance, hybrid mismatches may result from the difference in the CIT tax treatment of (i) financial instruments, (ii) entities or (iii) payment attribution rules between two countries. Such differences may result in either: i A deduction for tax purposes in one country (the payer’s jurisdiction) without corresponding inclusion in the other (the payee’s jurisdiction); or ii A deduction in both countries (i.e., in the jurisdiction in which the payment has its source and in the investor’s jurisdiction). The new Hybrid Mismatch Rules provide for neutralization mechanisms of these mismatches which broadly lead to either (i) a non-deduction of payments or (ii) an inclusion in the taxable income of these payments. In practice, the Hybrid Mismatch Rules may concern any type of expenditure (including financial expenses) but shall only apply if a mismatch outcome arises either (i) between associated enterprises or (ii) under a structured arrangement (i.e., an arrangement involving a hybrid mismatch where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangement or an arrangement that has been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch outcome). For the purposes of these rules, an associated enterprise is different from a related party within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC and means: - an entity in which the taxpayer (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of that entity; - a person which (i) holds directly or indirectly a participation in terms of voting rights or capital ownership in a taxpayer of 50% or more or (ii) is entitled to receive 50% or more of the profits of the taxpayer; - a taxpayer in which a person, who holds directly or indirectly a participation of 50% or more of the taxpayer’s voting rights or capital, also holds an interest of 50% or more of the voting rights or capital; ----- - an entity that is part of the same consolidated group for financial accounting purposes as the taxpayer; An enterprise in which the taxpayer has a significant influence in the management or an enterprise that has a significant influence in the management of the taxpayer. Pursuant to Article 212 bis of the FTC, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, net financial charges, which are defined as the portion of financial charges exceeding financial income, accrued by companies that are subject to French corporate income tax, without distinction between third-party debts and related-party debts are deductible from their taxable result only up to a maximum amount equal to the higher of: (i) €3 million (to be adjusted on a _prorata temporis basis for fiscal years which do no last twelve months) and (ii) 30% of the company’s result before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization adjusted for tax purposes (“Tax EBITDA”) generated in the same fiscal year (the “30% EBITDA Limitation”). By exception, subject to certain exceptions and safeharbour clauses, where the average amount of the relatedparty debts of a company within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC during a fiscal year exceeds in respect of that fiscal year one and a half times the amount of its equity (fonds propres), net financial expenses borne by such company are deductible for a portion of their amount up to the higher of (i) 30% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €3 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of non-related party debts increased by 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said year. The balance of net financial expenses is deductible for a portion of their amount up to the highest of (i) 10% of its Tax EBITDA and (ii) €1 million multiplied by a ratio equal to (A) the average amount of related-party debt exceeding 1.5x the company’s equity (assessed either at the beginning or at the closing date of the fiscal year) divided by (B) the average amount of all sums borrowed by or made available to the company during said fiscal year Under Article 223 B bis of the FTC, the above mentioned limitations apply, mutatis mutandis, to companies that belong to French tax-consolidated groups with respect to amounts made available by lenders outside such group. Finally, pursuant to Article 223 B of the FTC (generally referred to as the “Amendement Charasse”), when the shares of a target company are purchased from a seller by a company controlled directly or indirectly by such seller (or placed under common control with the seller), and the target company and the acquiring company become members of the same French tax-consolidated group, a portion of the interest incurred by the French taxconsolidated group in respect of a fiscal year is considered as non-deductible and is therefore added back to the tax-consolidated income. This add-back of financial costs is applicable over a maximum period of nine fiscal years (including the acquisition’s fiscal year) unless the target company leaves the French tax consolidated group (other than as a result of a merger with a company of the tax group to which the acquiring company belongs). If the limitation applies, the amount to be added back for each fiscal year is computed as follows: Purchase price of the shares Non-deductible interest Interest expenses deducted from the tax = x expenses group’s taxable income Average amount of the tax group’s debts The above mentioned tax rules may limit the Group’s ability to deduct interest accrued on the Group’s indebtedness incurred in France and, as a consequence, may increase the Group’s tax burden, which could adversely affect the Group’s business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service the Group’s indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining their services or that we would be successful in hiring and training suitable replacements without undue costs or delays. As a result, the loss of the support of our founder and controlling shareholder (including the allocation of his time to any other business interests) or any of these key executives and employees could cause disruptions in our business operations, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure to apply the necessary managerial and operational resources to our growing business and any weaknesses in our operational and financial systems or managerial controls and procedures may impact the Group’s ability to produce reliable financial statements and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In our business, we rely on sales forces and call center employees to interface with the major part of our customers. Their reliability is key, as is our relationship with employee representatives. Some of our employees currently belong to organized unions and works councils, and there can be no assurance that more employees will not form or join unions in the future. An increase in the number of our unionized employees could lead to an increased likelihood of strikes, work stoppages and other industrial actions. In addition, we also face the risk of strikes called by employees of our key suppliers of materials or services as well as our installation providers, which could result in interruptions in the performance of our services.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, Next Alt is the controlling ----- shareholder of Altice Europe, and Altice Europe (through its indirect subsidiaries) owns 100% share capital and voting rights in the Issuer. In the event of consummation of the Take-Private Transaction, Next Alt will be the sole shareholder of Altice Europe and consequently Altice Europe would no longer have public investors as minority shareholders. When business opportunities, or risks and risk allocation arise, the interests of Altice Europe (or its affiliates) or Next Alt may be different from, or in conflict with, the Group’s interests on a standalone basis. Altice Europe and Next Alt may allocate certain of their risks to the Issuer or the Group and the Issuer cannot assure you that Altice Europe or Next Alt will permit the Group to pursue certain business opportunities. As a result of its controlling position, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power, among other things, to affect the Group’s legal and capital structure and day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and change the Group’s management and to approve any other changes to the Group’s strategy, structure and operations. A change of strategy or management adversely affecting the Group’s operations could indirectly have an adverse effect on the Issuer’s abilities to meet its obligations under the Notes. In addition, Altice Europe or Next Alt has, directly or indirectly, the power to control the Group’s ability to enter into any corporate transaction and prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders, regardless of whether holders of the Notes believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, Altice Europe or Next Alt could exercise such power to cause us to incur additional indebtedness or sell certain material assets, in each case, so long as the Group’s debt instruments and the Intercreditor Agreement permit. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the Group’s debt service obligations and the sale of certain assets could reduce the Group’s ability to generate revenues, each of which could adversely affect the holders of the Notes. Furthermore, Altice Europe and its other subsidiaries also have substantial indebtedness. To the extent permitted by the Indenture and other agreements governing the indebtedness of the Group, the Board of Directors of the Issuer may (in compliance with their fiduciary duties as directors of a public company), in addition to the proceeds of the Notes which will be upstreamed by the Issuer to shareholders and used by a subsidiary of Altice Europe to (and an indirect shareholder of Altice France Holding and the Issuer) to repay certain of its indebtedness, vote to distribute cash to its shareholders to allow them to service and repay such indebtedness, including certain senior debt incurred by Altice France Holding.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The Group may have to negotiate at length with unions and works councils, and may suffer strikes, labor conflicts, work stoppages and other labor action, and it may also encounter difficulties in attracting and keeping staff due to local or general strikes. Strikes and other labor action, as well as the negotiating of new collective bargaining agreements or wage negotiations, could disrupt our activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The Group is active in very competitive markets that are constantly evolving, thus requiring its constant adaptation to, anticipation and adoption of new operational practices and technologies to preserve its competitiveness and our efficiency. This entails regular changes in organizations, which requires adaptation on the part of the human resources involved. In particular, this process demands an ability to mobilize skills and motivate and orient teams toward our objectives. As a result, the Group’s activities may sometimes be affected by a deterioration of the labor relations with our employees, staff representative bodies or labor unions. In such instances, certain of the Group’s entities would have to consult their staff representative bodies, or will have to do so, in order to successfully execute the Group’s current and future projects, which is likely to slow down the performance of certain operations. The Group also faces the risk of strikes called by employees of our main suppliers of equipment or services, as well as our facility providers, the latter generally organized in regional unions, which could lead to interruptions in our services. The Group cannot guarantee that labor conflicts or difficulties in retaining our staff will not have a material adverse effect our business and, potentially, our results of operations and our financial position. The Group has undertaken a simplification of its organization and implemented certain operating synergies measures. This transformation plan involves numerous situations of internal mobility, which may result in employee dissatisfaction or loss of personnel. In addition, the Group has optimized its workforce and executed a voluntary retirement plan taken up by a significant number of employees.

The only significant assets of the Issuer on the Issue Date will consist of cash in its bank accounts and its shares in its direct subsidiaries and various intercompany loans to its subsidiaries. As such, the Issuer will be wholly dependent upon payments under such loans and other payments from members of the Group in order to service its debt obligations under the Notes to the extent it does not have cash to meet those obligations. The ability of members of the Group to make such payments will depend upon their cash flows and earnings which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, the payment of dividends and the making, or repayment, of loans and advances to the Issuer by the Issuer’s subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions. The ability of any of the Issuer’s direct or indirect subsidiaries to make certain distributions may be limited by the laws of the relevant jurisdiction in which the subsidiaries are organized or located, including financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, requirements that dividends must be paid out of reserves available for distribution and other legal restrictions which, if violated, might require the recipient to refund unlawful payments. In some cases, receipt of such payments or advances may be subject to onerous tax consequences. Although the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement limit the ability of the Issuer’s subsidiaries to enter into future consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends and make other payments to the Issuer or the Guarantors, there are significant qualifications and exceptions to these limitations. We cannot assure you that arrangements with the Issuer’s subsidiaries and the funding permitted by the agreements governing existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer’s subsidiaries will provide the Guarantors or the Issuer with sufficient dividends, distributions or loans to fund payments under their Notes Guarantees or the Notes when due.

The value of the Notes Collateral and the amount that may be received upon a sale of Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors including, among others, the condition of the Notes Collateral, the ability to sell the Notes ----- Collateral in an orderly sale, industry, market and economic conditions, whether the business is sold as a going concern, the availability of buyers and other factors. With respect to any shares of the Group’s subsidiaries pledged to secure the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, winding up or other similar proceedings in relation to the entity’s shares that have been pledged because all of the obligations of the entity whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the creditors secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, courts could limit recoverability with respect to the Notes Collateral if they deem a portion of the interest claim usurious in violation of applicable public policy. As a result, liquidating the Notes Collateral may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any amounts due on the Notes. If the proceeds of Notes Collateral were not sufficient to repay amounts outstanding under the Notes, then holders of the Notes (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Notes Collateral) would only have an unsecured claim against the Issuer’s and Guarantors’ remaining assets. See “—It may be difficult to realize the value of the Notes Collateral securing the Notes.” No appraisal of the fair market value of the Notes Collateral has been made in connection with this offering of Notes. The book value of the Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a measure of realizable value for such assets. The value of the Notes Collateral could be impaired in the future as a result of changing economic and market conditions, the Group’s failure to successfully implement the Group’s business strategy, competition and other factors. The Notes Collateral may include intangible or other illiquid assets that by their nature may not have a readily ascertainable market value, whose value to other parties may be less than its value to the Group, or may not be readily saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in their liquidation. In addition, the value of the Notes Collateral may decrease because of obsolescence, impairment or certain casualty events. The Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Notes on the Notes Collateral securing the Notes. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy such liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Indentures, the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement and the Existing Term Loans Agreement or the Notes Collateral Documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees, to the extent such Notes and Notes Guarantees are secured by such Notes Collateral. Moreover, if the Issuer issues additional Notes under the Indenture, holders of such additional Notes would benefit from the same Notes Collateral as the holders of the Notes being offered hereby, thereby diluting holders of Notes’ ability to benefit from the liens on the Notes Collateral securing their Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement provides for detailed enforcement mechanisms with respect to the Notes Collateral and any enforcement of the Notes Collateral will be subject in many cases to significant limitations under local law.

The Initial Purchasers have neither analyzed the effect of, nor participated in any negotiations relating to, such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, loss of legal perfection and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Notes Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Notes Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or recharacterization under the laws of certain jurisdictions. The security interests of the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over real or personal property such as the Notes Collateral. For example, the Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including that of competent regulatory authorities or courts, to enforce a security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents. The Group also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, and the value of the Notes Collateral may significantly decrease. ----- Furthermore, enforcement procedures and timing for obtaining judicial decisions in Luxembourg may be materially more complex and time consuming than in equivalent situations in jurisdictions with which investors may be more familiar. In addition, the Group’s business requires a variety of national and local permits and licenses. The continued operation of properties that comprise part of the Notes Collateral and that depend on the maintenance of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or restricted. The Group’s business is subject to regulations and permitting requirements and may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing regulations or requirements or if changes in applicable regulations or requirements occur. In the event of foreclosure, the grant of permits and licenses may be revoked and the transfer of such permits and licenses may be prohibited or may require us to incur significant cost and expense. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the applicable governmental authorities will consent to the transfer of all such permits. If the regulatory approvals required for such transfers are not obtained, are delayed or are economically prevented, the foreclosure may be delayed, a temporary or lasting shutdown of operations may result, and the value of the Notes Collateral may be significantly decreased.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The liens on the Notes Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees, as the case may be, if the Security Agent is not able to or does not take the actions necessary to perfect or maintain the perfection of any such liens. Such failure may result in the invalidity of the relevant security interest in the Notes Collateral securing the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, as applicable, or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of such debt against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same Notes Collateral. In addition, applicable law may require that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest can only be perfected at the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. There can be no assurance that the Security Agent will monitor, or that we will inform the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute Notes Collateral, and that all necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after acquired collateral. Neither the Security Agent nor the Trustee has any obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that should constitute Notes Collateral or the perfection of, or to take steps to perfect, any security interest therein. Such failure may result in the loss of the security interest in the Notes Collateral or adversely affect the priority of the security interest in favor of the Notes and the Notes Guarantees against third parties including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who may claim a secured interest in any part of the Notes Collateral. Additionally, the Indenture and the Notes Collateral Documents may require the Group to take a number of actions that might improve the perfection or priority of the liens of the Security Agent in the Notes Collateral.

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under bankruptcy or insolvency law and other laws, a court could (i) void or invalidate all or a portion of a Guarantor’s obligations under its Notes Guarantee or the security interests in respect thereof, (ii) direct that the holders of the Notes return any amounts paid under a Notes Guarantee to the relevant Guarantor or to a fund for the benefit of the Guarantor’s creditors or (iii) take other action that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found that: - the relevant Notes Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another, hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the relevant Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, when the granting of the Notes Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference or when the recipient was aware that the relevant Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee; - the relevant Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value or corporate benefit for the relevant Notes Guarantee and such Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of the relevant Notes Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; - the relevant Notes Guarantee was held to exceed or breach financial assistance rules or the corporate objects of the Guarantors or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantors; or - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of the Group’s subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts in such jurisdictions could limit the enforceability of the Notes Guarantee against the Guarantor. We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor was “insolvent” at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a court would not determine that a Guarantor was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was issued, that payments for the benefit of holders of the Notes constituted preferences, fraudulent transfers or conveyances on other grounds. The measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon applicable governing law. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if, at the time it incurred indebtedness: ----- - the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, is greater than the fair value of all its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount required to pay the probable liability on its existing debts and liabilities, including contingent liabilities, as they become due; or - it cannot pay with its available assets its debts as they become due. The liability of each Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will be contractually limited to the amount that will result in such Notes Guarantee not constituting a preference, fraudulent conveyance or improper corporate distribution or otherwise being set aside. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of each Guarantor. There is a possibility that the entire Notes Guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished. If a court decided that a Notes Guarantee was a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and voided such Notes Guarantee, or held it unenforceable for any other reason, you or the Security Agent for your benefit may cease to have any claim in respect of the relevant Guarantor and would be a creditor solely of the Issuer and, if applicable, of any other Guarantor under the relevant Notes Guarantee that has not been declared void. In the event that any Notes Guarantee is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or to the extent the agreed limitation of the Guarantee obligations apply, the Notes would be effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor, and if the Issuer cannot satisfy its obligations under the Notes or any Notes Guarantee is found to be a preference, fraudulent transfer or conveyance or is otherwise set aside, you may not be repaid in full amounts outstanding under the Notes.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks Relating to the Notes,13.5.13,The Issuer may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the applicable Indenture) as required by the Indenture.,"Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all the applicable outstanding Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase plus accrued and unpaid interest if any, to (but excluding) the date of purchase. If a change of control triggering event were to occur, there can be no assurances that the Issuer would have sufficient funds available at such time to pay such purchase price or that the restrictions in agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt would allow such Issuer to make such required repurchases. Additionally, under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes a mandatory prepayment event and an automatic cancellation of the facilities thereunder and under the Existing Term Loans a change of control triggering event (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default permitting the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the Existing Term Loans Agreement and the commitments thereunder to lend would terminate. The Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the holders of the Notes, and its other indebtedness following the occurrence of a change of control triggering event may be limited by the Group’s then existing financial resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. Furthermore, the Issuer’s ability to repurchase the Notes may be limited by law. If an event constituting a change of control triggering event occurs at a time when any of the Issuer is prohibited from repurchasing the Notes, under the agreements and instruments governing the Group’s debt, the Issuer may be required to seek the consent of the creditors under such indebtedness to purchase the Notes or may attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibition. If we do not obtain such consent or refinance such borrowings, we will remain prohibited from any such repurchases. In addition, we expect that we would require third party financing to make an offer to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control triggering event, as set forth in the Indenture. The Group cannot assure you that it would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the Issuer to offer to purchase Notes would constitute a default under the Indenture, which could, in turn, constitute a default under other agreements governing the Group’s debt. See “Description of Notes—Change of Control”. The change of control triggering event provisions contained in the Indenture may not necessarily afford you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including reorganizations, restructurings, mergers, recapitalizations or other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “change of control triggering event” as defined in the Indenture. Except as described under “Description of _Notes—Change of Control”, the Indenture will not contain provisions requiring the Group to offer to make_ ----- repurchases or redemptions, in the event of a reorganization, restructuring, merger, recapitalization or similar transaction. The definition of “change of control” to be contained in the Indenture includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer, and its restricted subsidiaries taken as whole to any person other than certain permitted holders. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. In addition, holders of the Notes may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase its Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of Altice Europe’s board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest, where Altice Europe’s board of directors initially publicly opposes the election of a dissident slate of directors, but subsequently approves such directors for the purposes of the Indenture. This may result in a change in the composition of the board of directors that, but for such subsequent approval, would have otherwise constituted a change of control requiring a repurchase offer under the terms of the Indenture. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuer is required to make an offer to repurchase its Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes, as applicable. The liquidity of a trading market for the Notes, as applicable, may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions.

The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuer that they currently intend to make a market in the Notes. However, the Initial Purchasers are not obliged to do so, and they may discontinue any market making activities at any time without notice.

Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Exchange or another listing exchange in accordance with the applicable Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell Notes in the secondary market.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Following the ECOFIN Council meeting of December 8, 2015, Estonia officially announced its withdrawal from the negotiations and, on March 16, 2016, completed the formalities required to leave the enhanced cooperation on the EU FTT. The EU FTT could, if introduced in its current draft form, apply, under certain circumstances, to some transactions involving the Notes and to persons both established within and outside the Participating Member States. The EU FTT proposal remains subject to negotiations between the Participating Member States, the scope of such tax being therefore uncertain. The timing of its implementation remains also unclear. Additional Member States may decide to participate and certain of the Participating Member States may decide to withdraw. At the ECOFIN Council meeting of June 14, 2019, a state of play of the work on the EU FTT was presented on the basis of a note prepared by Germany on June 7, 2019 indicating a consensus among the Participating Member States (excluding Estonia) to continue negotiations on the basis of a joint French-German proposal based on the French financial transactions tax model which in principle would only concern shares of listed companies whose head office is in a Member State of the European Union. However, such proposal is still subject to change until a final approval.

Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our or the Notes’ credit ratings may generally affect the market value of the Notes. Ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks relating to structure, market and additional factors discussed in this Offering Memorandum, and other factors not discussed herein may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.

There is no assurance that such credit ratings will be issued or remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies, if, in the applicable rating agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. It is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with the application of the proceeds of this offering or in connection with future events, such as future acquisitions.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.1,1.** **Pay Television,123.1.1,,"_Introduction_ The French pay-TV television market is one of the largest in Europe. As with other European markets, the behavior of B2C consumers of television services in France is increasingly centered on digital, innovative, HD, Ultra-HD, and 3D-TV television services, as well as interactive television services such as VOD, which require large bandwidth, along with bi-directional distribution platforms. _Broadcast platforms_ In France, television signal broadcasting platforms include satellite, IP (DSL/FTTH), the cable network of the Group, digital terrestrial television (“DTT”) systems and OTT. TV viewers who have the appropriate television equipment may receive signals and watch programs on approximately 27 television channels free of charge (with no subscription) through DTT. In order to have access to more channels or content, TV viewers must subscribe to pay-TV services. The pay-TV market in France is divided between standard pay-TV in the form of packages of standard channels, in other words DTT channels, as well as low added-value channels, and premium pay-TV in the form of premium channel offers, which are specialized in sports, cinema and other thematic channels. The incumbent operators of pay-TV must confront growing competition in free television (including DTT) and other alternatives to pay-TV (OTT and catch-up TV), although the competitive advantage of pay-TV (excellent quality programming and premium services) and the loyalty of the existing subscriber base have contributed to its sustainability (low price sensitivity and weak churn). The growth of IPTV has transformed the market, offering the possibility of providing pay-TV services over Internet Protocol (IP) that go beyond the traditional cable and satellite methods (which is limited by the impossibility of installing a satellite dish on the facade of buildings in certain areas, such as the center of Paris). Even though pay-DTT (which now concerns only the Canal+ Group) currently represents a low share of pay-TV, providers of pay-DTT could in the future be able to offer a larger selection of channels to a broader audience at a price that is lower than the one billed by the Group for its cable television services. The Canal+ Group distributes its offers on all broadcasting platforms: DSL, DTT, satellite and the cable network of the Group (in the latter case, only for channels that belong to Canal+, called Les Chaînes Canal+, excluding CanalSat). The Canal+ Group has two additional offers: a premium offer consisting of Les Chaînes Canal+ and a multi-channel package known as CanalSat. These two supplementary offers may be subscribed to individually or together. The Canal+ Group has developed numerous services with high added value to its offerings, such as CanalPlay (TV on-demand not available by satellite but available on the Group’s cable network), HD or even multi-screen broadcasting. As of December 31, 2019, the Canal+ Group had 20.4 million individual subscribers, of which 8.6 million individual subscribers are in mainland France (Source: Vivendi H1 2020 Results). The Canal + Group has negotiated agreements with broadcasters on the broadcasting platforms to which they hold rights. With regard to Canal+ Group, the Group’s pay-TV offers are above all in competition with the CanalSat offers, as the content of their offers is similar (the content of the Canal+ channels is exclusive to the Canal+ Group). There are several Canal+ offers, from the basic Canal+ offer for €19.9 per month to Intégrale+ offer, which include all Canal+ and CanalSat channels (€99.9 per month). Last, one may customize its offer adding thematic pack(s) (Family, Canal+ channels, Cinema Series and/or Sport – including beIN) to the main pack (Canal+ and Canal+ Décalé). The Multisports and beIN Sport channels are not included (unless temporary offers) but may, along with other channels, be added as an option. ----- (a) Cable The Group is the only major cable operator in France. The revenue for cable network operators is primarily derived from subscription costs paid by subscribers for services provided. The Group estimates that direct access to its subscribers will allow it to identify and respond locally to their demand for specific products and services more easily, and thus to better serve them. The services provided by the cable networks feature easy-to-use technology, installation that is adapted to equipment at subscribers’ homes, and reliable secure signals which are directly broadcast to their homes. Cable television subscribers can access the customer services provided by the cable operator upon request. Cable also offers subscribers a high quality of service, including excellent image quality, multiple HD channels, 3D-TV compatibility and VOD offers. With the market trending towards group offers for multimedia and telecommunications services, the market share in cable television should benefit from the capacity of cable to provide triple play services that benefit from a broad bandwidth, fast speed and bi-directional capacity. (b) DSL/VDSL2 Triple and quadruple play offers from the Group are in competition with DSL offers from Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which are currently offering television services to subscribers connected to the Group’s network by using high-speed DSL internet connections, and with CanalSat, which offers premium pay-TV on DSL and satellite networks. Even though DSL technology covers a potentially larger customer base (covering, for Orange, its local loop, and for the others, the part of Orange’s local exchange which was unbundled), the Group estimates that the superiority of its fiber optic/cable technology in terms of quality, reliability and richness of content will allow it to challenge this statement in the years to come in the areas where the Group has rolled out its fiber optic/cable network. See “Business of the Group—Network”. The Group estimates that DSL television presents a disadvantage as compared to cable: the addition of television services on a DSL network has the effect of saturating the network and decreasing the available bandwidth for the other services offered, in particular highspeed internet services which require broad bandwidth. However, the roll-out of FTTH could attenuate the effects of this disadvantage. (c) FTTH Operators are expanding their FTTH networks, with the most active players being Orange and the Group. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had approximately 17.5 million homes passed with fiber/cable, Orange 19.3 million FTTH connectible homes, while Iliad had 16.8 million connectible sockets and Bouygues was marketing 14.3 million FTTH premises. Triple and quadruple play offers from the Group are in competition with fiber offers from Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which are currently offering television services to subscribers connected to the Group’s network by using high-speed FTTH internet connections. These offers are more competitive than the historical xDSL offers. As of March 31, 2020, almost 75.8% of ultra-fast broadband subscriptions were coupled with a pay-TV subscription. (Source: ARCEP) (d) Satellite Satellite holds an important place on the French television market, in particular for premium products. Satellite subscribers may opt for free satellite television or pay satellite television. Satellite operators broadcast digital signals directly to television viewers at the national level. To receive the satellite signal, TV viewers must have a satellite dish, satellite receiver and a TV set-top box. They must also have a “smart card” to access subscription and premium television services that are broadcast by satellite. Satellite operators of free TV have no contractual relationship with television viewers and thus do not collect any subscription fees or other royalties. Satellite broadcasting presents a certain number of competitive advantages compared to cable television services, in particular a wider range of available programs on a larger geographic zone, in particular in rural areas. Conversely, the Group estimates that satellites are less widely available in urban areas due to restrictions on the installation of satellite dishes. The Group considers that satellites also present the following disadvantages compared to cable: (i) high initial costs of obtaining and installing a dish; (ii) lack of regular maintenance services which, conversely, are provided by cable operators; and (iii) the vulnerable nature of the reception of satellite signals to external interference, such as unfavorable weather conditions. ----- (e) Pay digital terrestrial television The Group’s cable television services are likewise in competition with the pay-DTT operators, such as the Canal+ Group. DTT currently offers only a limited number of channels, and no interactive television service, providing above all free television, although the quality of the image provided is good. (f) OTT and other emerging technologies The Group is faced with growing competition for alternative methods for broadcasting television services other than through traditional cable networks. For example, online content aggregators which broadcast OTT programs on a high-speed network, such as Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix, have already become competitors and are expected to grow stronger in the future. Connected or “smart” TVs facilitate the use of these services. OTT refers to high speed broadcasting of video and audio content without the internet access provider being involved in the control or distribution of the program (its role is limited to transporting IP packages), as opposed to the purchase of video or audio programs from an internet access provider such as VOD video services or IPTV. Outside France, OTT has had great success. The extent of the competition these alternative technologies will exert on the Group’s cable television system in France is not yet known. In particular, OTT in France is affected by the “media chronology” in France, which forces subscription VOD services to comply with a minimum period of 36 months between when a film comes out in France and when it becomes available in a subscription VOD catalog, although this does not apply to series or films that are not shown in theaters. Netflix launched offers in France on September 15, 2014, offering a one-month free trial and then flat fees beginning at €7.99 per month for basic definition screens, and up to €13.99 per month for four HD-quality screens. Bouygues Telecom and Orange have signed agreements with Netflix under which their respective subscribers may directly access unlimited on-demand video service on their television via a Netflix subscription as of November 2014 (Source: Bouygues Telecom and Orange.fr website release). The television offer with Google Play under the Group’s “SFR” brand also includes access to Netflix. Apple TV is also a competitor, and allows content to be broadcast on the television, with access to available content on iTunes and at other providers (CanalPlay, YouTube). Google TV is also available, either directly on certain televisions, or with a set-top box, and offers on-demand content as well as access to applications such as YouTube. Amazon has also been available since 2016 with its Prime Video service (€49.99 per year included with Amazon Prime). The latest entrant is Disney+, available since April 2020 (€6.99 per month) which offers a large content portfolio of Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic. The offers of these providers or of other providers of content and/or technologies could significantly increase the pressure for competition on the French market, impacting the prices and structure of the offers. Nevertheless, such technologies could contribute to increasing the demand for very-high-speed internet access services that are offered by the Group.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.2,2.** **Broadband internet,123.2.1,,"_Introduction_ High-speed internet access, often referred to simply as “high-speed internet”, is a high-speed data internet connection. Recommendation I.113 of the Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (“ITU”) defines “high-speed internet” or “broadband” as a transmission capacity that is higher than the primary speed of the ISDN, which is approximately 1.5 to 2 Mbps. France, with 29.9 million high-speed internet subscribers as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP), is one of the largest high-speed internet access markets in Europe. However, in terms of very-high-speed internet access, the French market has a relatively low penetration rate, with just 40.1% of households having very-high-speed internet access as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). The Group estimates that these low penetration rates constitute an attractive growth opportunity for the Group as a reliable very-high-speed internet access provider. Smartphones and tablets are proliferating, and as they are increasingly used for multimedia functions, B2C subscriptions require both more bandwidth (to adapt to the increased average number of screens per household) and quicker download speeds (to adapt to the use of multimedia services). ----- The main high-speed internet access technologies are DSL (VDSL2) and fiber optics/cable. Digital analog modems, internet access via electric cable and local wireless loop technology are likewise available in France, although to a lesser extent. _Main distribution platforms—DSL, VDSL2, fiber optics and cable_ DSL is the first high-speed internet access platform in France, with 17.3 million subscribers as of March 31, 2020, representing approximately 58.0% of the total French high-speed and very-high-speed market (Source: ARCEP). This situation is the result of several factors: the regulatory environment which encouraged competition for DSL thanks to unbundling and regulated wholesale prices; the relatively recent consolidation cable activity in France and the weak cable coverage level (cable represented only 9.6% of households that had access to very-high speed fixed services, as of March 31, 2020) (Source: ARCEP); the fact that the modernization of cable networks is relatively recent; and the relatively low levels of roll-out of fiber optics. DSL currently offers consumers a maximum speed of approximately 29Mbps (Source: Bouygues Telecom, _https://www.bouyguestelecom.fr/static/cms/tarifs/Guide_Des_Tarifs.pdf). The average speeds experienced by_ subscribers are likely to be lower than the maximum speeds. In particular, DSL speeds depend on the distances between the access point to the local loop and the home. The Group’s network uses both FTTH technology and FTTB technology. Both technologies currently offer consumers a maximum speed of 1 Gbps. The major difference between the FTTH networks and the FTTB network lies in the fact that for FTTB, the vertical connection (within the building) to the subscriber uses a coaxial cable. The roll-out of FTTH networks in France began slowly. Installation of this type of technology represents an investment of capital and time, and requires civil engineering and cabling work, be it horizontally to increase the number of residents covered, or vertically within buildings. The government considers the FTTH networks to constitute a significant part of its long-term investment plan and in February 2013 announced an FTTH roll-out program of €20 billion (invested by private operators and local and regional authorities) and the objective of providing very-high-speed internet access to the entire country by 2022. As of 2020, the Government targets that by 2022 the very-high speed network (over 30Mbits/s) will be available to the entire French territory, and similarly to generalise FTTH accessibility by 2025 (Source: https://www.amenagement-numerique.gouv.fr/). The government will provide a €3,300 million subsidy package, a portion of which comes from the Investments for the Future Program (Programme des Investissements d’Avenir) which is managed by France’s General Commissariat for Investments and governed by the 2015 Budget Act. The roll-out has been divided in three zones: (i) very dense areas (5.5 million households) (ii) middle-density areas (12.5 million households); and (iii) lowdensity areas (15.2 million households). Very dense areas and middle-density areas are expected to be covered with privately-funded networks while private operators are expected to co-invest with public partners in the lowdensity areas (Source: ARCEP). Orange and the Issuer will lead the deployment of the very-high speed network in privately-funded, low density areas, with the Issuer being in charge of 20% of the network deployment (Source: _TeleGeography, https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2018/06/28/orange-altice-ink- new-fibre-sharing-deal/). Various local and regional authorities have already extended subsidies to network_ operators to install FTTH connections. This trend should continue, as certain departments, municipalities and regions, such as Hauts-de-Seine, Amiens and Louvin, for example, have entered into public-private partnerships to encourage such investments. As of March 31, 2020, France had a total of 7.7 million very-high-speed internet subscribers via FTTH, a 44.4% increase in one year (Source: ARCEP). The Group signed agreements with Orange, as did Free, relating to the roll-out of fiber optics in less dense zones of France. In accordance with the conditions established by ARCEP, third-party operators may likewise have access to the infrastructure used by an operator, including by co-financing projects, for their own very-high-speed internet offers. VDSL2 technology is an alternative solution. DSL networks may be improved, and a portion of them have already been improved, thanks to the VDSL2 technology, which the government authorized for use in April 2013, and which may provide maximum bandwidth download speeds of up to 100 Mbps. More particularly, the roll-out of VDSL2 only requires the addition of VDSL2 cards in the DSLAMs that were already rolled out and does not entail any physical intervention at the subscriber’s home. As of March 31, 2020, very-high-speed subscribers represented approximately 40.1% of all high-speed internet subscribers (Source: ARCEP), and the Group was the top player in this market. The Group currently offers cable subscribers internet speeds up to 1 Gbps through its modernized network and set top boxes. ----- The following table shows the distribution between high-speed internet services in France, between March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019 (Source: ARCEP):",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

As of March 31, 2020, there were a total of approximately 77.1 million SIM cards (excluding M2M) on the French market (including 74.9 million “active” cards) and, as of March 31, 2020, 63.2 million active mobile 3G subscribers and 55.5 million active mobile 4G subscribers (Source: ARCEP). The Group, along with Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free, also rolled out offers based on 4G/LTE, which allow quicker high-speed mobile internet service to be provided. In October 2011, Orange, the Group, Bouygues Telecom and Free obtained licenses for the spectrum range of 2.6 GHz, adapted to the roll-out of the 4G/LTE networks. As of June 30, 2020, the Group has 19,314 4G mobile antennas, just after Orange (22,184) (Source: _ANFR). The Group, Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom have already announced they are preparing the arrival_ of the next generation of mobile telephony with 5G technology (Source: Q1 2018—PR Results p. 11/18, Orange— _Preparing 5G p. 1/6, Free—Preparing 5G p. 2/4, Bouygues Telecom—Preparing 5G—JV with Huawei and Trials in Bordeaux p. 2/4). The 5G auction, which was initially planned for January 2020 and delayed because of the_ COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to take place end September 2020 (Source: ARCEP). Moreover, alternative internet access technologies could be introduced in the future. These technologies should further increase competition, or could lead operators to increase their investment costs to make additional upgrades. Competition in these alternative technologies, specifically in terms of pricing, could become more intense in the future.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.6,3.** **Fixed-line telephony,123.6.1,,"Traditional switched voice lines have been on the decline for several years, being gradually replaced by VoIP lines and mobile telephony. More generally, fixed-line telephony has become a basic product, which is now generally grouped under multi-play offers. The fixed-line services have consequently become dependent on a quality high-speed internet offer. Flat rates for fixed-line telephony have become the market standard. The fixed B2C telephony market in France is also facing the pressure exerted by alternate operators, with the decrease in the prices of mobile telephony and interconnection rates, as well as alternative access technologies and other internet telephony methods offered on high-speed internet connections. The Group is expecting competition to be increasingly intense in the future, in particular in terms of pricing. Fixed-line traffic dropped approximately 0.7% in Q1-2020, as compared to Q1-2019 (Source: ARCEP). -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.7,4.** **Mobile Telephony,123.7.1,,"_Introduction_ France is one of the largest mobile telephony markets in Europe. At March 31, 2020, there was a total of approximately 77.1 million SIM cards in France (excluding M2M), representing a 118.9% penetration rate in the French population (Sources: ARCEP, INSEE), a figure that has consistently increased over the past few years. The historically low mobile telephony penetration rate, combined with the drop in market prices, has led to a significant increase in mobile telephony subscriptions. This growth has been driven by the subscription contract segment, which increased by nearly 2.8% in volume between Q1-2019 and Q1-2020 (Source: ARCEP). The increase in the subscription contract segment and the decline in the prepaid contracts segment are primarily due to customers’ desire to switch to post-paid and to the competition of flat-rate offers free of commitment and at reduced rates. The income from mobile services on the retail market, which dropped since 2011, has been slightly growing in 2019 from approximately €13.1 billion to approximately €13.3 billion, representing a 1.5% growth in 2019 as compared to 2018 (including M2M revenues). In the twelve months leading to March 31, 2020, the income from mobile services increased modestly to €13.4 billion (Source: ARCEP). This improvement can be partly explained by the steady increase in the number of contracts, whose revenue per SIM card is three times higher than prepaid. The drop in this income that was noted during the 2012-2014 period is primarily attributable to two effects: - drops in rate are primarily a consequence of the arrival of a fourth mobile network operator, Free, in January 2012. This intensification in competition had the effect of lowering mobile offer rates in France. This trend is particularly found on the retail market, but has repercussions for the business and wholesale markets too; - call termination fees were divided by 2.5 between 2011 and 2013, and then became stable (Source: _ARCEP—Major Files—call terminations). Nevertheless, in the future, the impact that a potential_ decrease in these rates could have on the income of operators should be limited, given the particularly low level achieved in France as compared to the rest of Europe (€0.0076 for a mobile voice call termination in the metropolitan area as of January 1, 2016 for all operators and announced €0.0074 as of January 1, 2017. Source: ARCEP—Major Files—call terminations; approximately €0.00968 on average _in Europe as of January, 2018—Source: Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications BEREC). The drop in income drawn from roaming, which is linked to the reduction in wholesale and_ retail fees for intra-Europe roaming, also had an impact on the sector’s revenues. This drop should continue in the upcoming years, due to the expected decreases in roaming fees, which simultaneously result from regulatory changes and commercial offers from operators. _Market segmentation_ Historically, there were only three mobile network operators in France: Orange, the Group and Bouygues Telecom. Iliad was granted the fourth mobile license in 2009, and launched a mobile telephony service in January 2012 under the brand name Free. Free’s entry disturbed the market, intensifying competition due to its price-setting strategy, which introduced new reduced-price commercial offers onto the market. Before Free’s entry, the majority of subscription contracts were based on limited usage (e.g.: four hours of communications) and subsidized cell phones. Free primarily introduced packages without cell phones, which contained limited outsourced services, but while providing unlimited data and communications offers (3G) at a very low cost (€19.99/month for its key offer). After years of intense competition in France post launch of new 4G offers (specifically after the launch by Free and B&You of 4G offers at the same price as 3G offers in 2013) and the development of low-cost brands, in 2019 the mobile telephony market has shown signs of recovery and rationalization notably due to the end of promotions and client repricing. Other competitors also introduced low-price brands, such as B&You (Bouygues Telecom) and Sosh (Orange). The Group also adapted its strategy by launching its low-cost “SFR RED” brand. Free quickly gained market share, having attained approximately 13.4 million mobile customers as of June 30, 2020, and a market share of approximately 17.4%, eight years after its commercial launch (Source: Iliad H1-2020 Earnings Release and _ARCEP)._ The French mobile market is also characterized by an important share of subscription services, i.e., 68.7 million as of March 31, 2020 (excluding M2M SIMs. Source: ARCEP). This is primarily due to prepaid offers being ----- replaced by low-priced post-paid offers (e.g.: €2 per month) with a small number of communication hours (e.g.: two hours of communication) and limited internet. Over the past few years, MVNOs such as NRJ Mobile and La Poste Mobile have also used mobile operator networks to sell mobile products that bear their own brand names. The migration of customers to MVNOs seems to have stabilized, with MVNOs representing only a small market share in the French mobile market. As of March 31, 2020, Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Iliad (Free) reported a total of 21.5 million, 18.2 million and 13.4 million mobile customers, respectively (Source: June 2020 earnings releases). _Price setting dynamics_ In 2019, mobile services revenue returned to growth with a total of €13.3 billion revenues excluding VAT (1.5%, from €13.1 billion in 2018). In the twelve months leading to March 31, 2020, the income from mobile services increased modestly to €13.4 billion (Source: ARCEP). After having reached a maximum of €19.5 billion in 2010, this income decreased over the next six years, with a decline reaching almost €2 billion in 2013 (Source: ARCEP). Indeed, in the past few years, the increased competition on the French mobile market has resulted in a drop in market prices, primarily due to the change in offers of certain subscribers to the benefit of post-paid services. Part of the reason for the return of revenue growth is the continued increase in the number of postpaid contracts, whose revenue per SIM is three times higher than of prepaid. Income attributable to postpaid, corresponding to €12.7 billion excluding tax, went up for the second year in a row and represents 95.0% of all mobile operators’ revenue (Source: ARCEP). _4G/LTE_ The French market has historically been slower than other European markets in terms of mobile data consumption. Despite the high concentration of post-paid subscriptions, the market has been historically slower as concerns data services. Recently, this trend has changed, insofar as the operators have begun to launch 4G offers at reduced prices. As of March 31, 2020, 72.0% of SIM cards were 4G-enabled, representing an increase of 6.3 million sim cards to reach 55.5 million sim cards (Source: ARCEP). Free was the first operator to introduce 4G at no additional cost in December 2013. Other operators on the market aligned their prices for 4G with those of Free, with all mobile network operators now offering similar all-inclusive 4G packages at an opening price of €20 per month. _Mobile call termination rates_ Mobile call termination rates have been reduced by regulators across Europe. In France, ARCEP announced in 2011 that it would reduce mobile call termination rates (symmetrically for the main operators, which did not include Free because it had not yet launched its commercial operations). In late June 2011, Orange and the Group billed €0.03 per minute while Bouygues Telecom billed €0.034. The new regulations required operators to reduce the rate to €0.02 per minute as of July 1, 2011, €0.015 as of January 1, 2012, €0.01 as of July 1, 2012, €0.008 as of January 1, 2013, €0.0078 as of January 1st, 2015, €0.0076 as of January 1, 2016 and €0.0074 as of January 1, 2017. Consequently, France has one of the lowest mobile call termination rates in Europe, with limited margin for new rate reductions; in comparison, the average rate in Europe is €0.00968 as of January 2018 (Source: Body _of European Regulators for Electronic Communications). Mobile spectrum and network coverage_ Mobile communications are provided through the use of a set of frequencies which the regulator allocates to the various operators. Currently, the four main operators benefit from a varied frequency spectrum, ranging from 800 to 2,600 MHz, which allows all 2G, 3G and 4G technologies to be offered. The ongoing 5G auction will award licences to use frequencies in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band in metropolitan France. The operating licenses for the spectrum in France are generally granted for a period of twenty years, and the operators can only use the technology covered by the license on each band of the spectrum. The other operators have very similar positions on the spectrum bands, which allows them to effectively compete in all of the technologies. The most recent frequency bid in France was for 700MHz in November 2015. ----- _Technological developments_ On mobile networks, in order to accompany the strong growth of mobile internet, operators have committed, in line with the evident desire of the public authorities, to the development of very-high speed-mobile infrastructure, which will supplement the 3G coverage already used. In fall 2012, certain operators opened their fourth-generation networks (4G) by using different frequencies (800 MHz, 2,600 MHz or 1,800 MHz). 4G and 4+ allow much higher speeds and capacities to be offered (up to theoretical download speeds of 100 Mbps) than those of the previous generation 3G+. 5G is gradually being deployed to prepare for the upcoming auction. It is expected to deliver even more speed and reliable connectivity.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.8,5.** **Bundling,123.8.1,,"The convergence of the B2C segment in France is the result of consumers’ desire to receive multimedia and telecommunications services from a single operator and at an attractive price. In response, operators offer television, high-speed internet and fixed-line telephony services, which are grouped into bundled offers known as “double play” (two services provided together), “triple play” (three services—telephone, internet, television— provided together) or “quadruple play” (telephone, internet, television and mobile telephony provided together). “Quadruple play” offers have been available in the French market since 2009 (Bouygues Telecom). The Group and Orange introduced “quadruple play” offers in 2010. Numericable followed in 2011 and Free did the same in 2012. These bundled service offerings allow multimedia and telecommunications service providers to satisfy the communication and entertainment needs of consumers, and draw new subscribers thanks to the improved value of the offers. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 27.8% of mobile customers were subscribing to a mobile and fixed offer (Source: ARCEP), while 71.4% of broadband subscriptions were coupled with pay-TV subscriptions. The fiber optic/two-way cable networks are particularly adept at supplying triple play services which require wide bandwidth. Initially designed to transmit significant amounts of data, the hybrid fiber and coaxial cable network of the Group, which is based on FTTB technology, allows it to provide high speeds to the customer, regardless of distance. Conversely, the actual speed of the DSL networks varies according to the distance from the access point to the local loop, since the speed decreases as the geographic distance from the subscriber compared to this access point increases (the maximum speeds noted are for customers located within one kilometer of the nearest access point). In order to increase and align network speeds, Orange began to invest in the construction of an FTTH network. Iliad and the Group also began to roll out FTTH networks. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 7.7 million subscribers were connected to FTTH networks (Source: ARCEP).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.9,6.** **Enterprise,123.9.1,,"Following the liberalization of the French telecommunications market in 1996, a large number of telecommunications operators penetrated the B2B segment, offering fixed telephony services, fixed- line internet access, data access links and, more recently, cloud computing services. The large corporate customer B2B market is very competitive and includes among its main players Orange, the Group, Bouygues Telecom, and Completel as well as international players. The market for other accounts is led by Orange, which competes with local players. The expectations of B2B customers differ from those of B2C subscribers. B2B customers demand that services be extremely reliable, and that they be able to be quickly re-established in case of failures (generally subject to financial penalties). B2B customers also require symmetrical bandwidth speeds, even though B2C subscribers are generally satisfied with asymmetrical speeds which provide quicker download times but slower uploads. B2B customers also demand increased security and are able to impose penalties (monetary or other) on operators if the contractual conditions are not respected. These requirements have an impact on the technological solutions offered to B2B customers, and explain the higher prices for the B2B segment. The penetration of mobile internet is increasing for the B2B market, specifically with more and more smartphones with a flat rate plan including data. In terms of fixed connectivity, the B2B market is now characterized by a growing penetration of fiber optics, which is linked to an increase in data consumption. Customers’ expectations are increasingly for convergent offers combining competitive services: fixed line telephony, which is increasingly converging with data via VoIP, mobile telephony and internet access (with an increasingly strong demand for very-high-speed access). These converging offers are specifically intended for micro-businesses and SMEs seeking all-in-one solutions. ----- They participate in the development of unified communications services for businesses and are characterized by the convergence of mobile and fixed-line telephony, and the development of collaborative tools (professional messaging service, instant messaging, video-conferencing, sharing tools). Beyond business services, the operators with a presence on the B2B market offer adjacent and supplementary services, including unified communications services and collaboration tools, as well as call center services or internet presence management, and managed security services, whether hosted or not, which accompany internet protocol (IP) communications services and remote work (including online backup, firewall, management and protection of secure access terminals to resources located in a business network). In terms of connectivity, the market features a growing penetration of fiber optics, which is linked to the increase in data consumption. _Voice_ The B2B segment for voice call services is extremely sensitive to price trends; customers are well informed and contracts are relatively short-term (one year). Being able to face the competition efficiently depends in part on the density of the network, and certain competitors of the Group have a broader and denser network. In recent years, the B2B market has experienced a structural change marked by a move from traditional switched voice services to VoIP services. _Data services_ On the B2B segment, for data services, being able to transfer large amounts of data and to have access to the newest technologies is extremely important to customers. On the data market, consumption has significantly increased and, currently, customers are often looking for combined infrastructure and software solutions. Price pressure has been strong in this competitive market. Conversely, the use of data transmission services has significantly increased. The Group is expecting the demand for data services and B2B bandwidth to continue growing, specifically due to the following factors: - the convergence between voice call and data services, such as VoIP, which leads to greater demand for solid network solutions; - an increase in the use of smartphones with a flat rate including data; - the centralization of IT equipment for businesses with operations at several sites, including combining servers at a single site, which increases the connectivity needs of peripheral sites of these businesses; - the emergence of new professional applications, such as videoconferencing; - the demand of larger businesses for quicker access, growing virtualization, data centers and improved security services; - the increase of digitalization in public administrations; - greater use by medium-size businesses of complex data services, such as cloud computing; and - professionals’ increased use of internal wireless networks. Customers are currently seeking to optimize and streamline their needs as much as possible through the use of data centers. Large corporations have a tendency to seek out specialized network solutions to control their chain of services end-to-end, and often have their own infrastructure. Other businesses are more apt to act according to their needs: (i) with “infrastructure as a service” (or IaaS/cloud) solutions to meet their needs in terms of data availability, storage and security. “Infrastructure as a service” can now offer these businesses data storage and safety solutions which would otherwise be too costly; or ----- (ii) a tailored and secure infrastructure up to the “middleware” (“software as a service”) level. The Group is currently facing competition from software providers and other IT providers of data and network solutions, and the line between them and the suppliers of data infrastructure and solutions like the Group has become increasingly blurred. Partnerships between IT providers and infrastructure providers are becoming more and more common, and are an additional source of competition. Particular growth is expected in data hosting outsourcing services. The complexity and growing management costs of IT systems are in effect pushing businesses to turn towards cloud solutions. This refers to a set of resources and services that are provided remotely, and which are thus accessible, for the user, in a flexible manner, on various terminals. Operators have already developed partnerships on “independent” cloud projects on French territory. This so-called “independent” cloud is intended for administrations, but also for private French businesses. It should allow sensitive information such as personal administrative data, information linked to e-health or even financial information requiring maximum security, to be stored. The B2B market also includes the IoT. The IoT covers a set of connected objects: in the broad sense, this includes communication terminals, but also inert objects, equipped, for example, with RFID chips, and machines on which built-in electronic systems equipped with SIM cards have been installed (M2M). These connected objects and machines are being developed in a certain number of adjacent markets for uses in specific sectors, such as home automation, health and security, but also energy and transportation, which are at the heart of digital city projects. Accordingly, in France, the number of M2M SIM cards has gone from 3.4 million in late 2011 to 6.9 million in late 2013, to 21.4 million as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). _Customers_ The B2B segment is also defined by the different needs of customers, which vary according to a business’ size. The major businesses are sophisticated customers, and are very sensitive to price trends. Speed, capacity, security and reliability are also very important. They have a tendency to unbundle services, and frequently subject them to invitations to bid. The smallest businesses are more likely to group them and ascribe more importance to the provider’s proximity.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.10,7.** **Wholesale market,123.10.1,,"The wholesale telecommunications market includes three sectors: voice call connectivity wholesale services (voice), data connectivity wholesale services and dark fiber infrastructure wholesale services. The Wholesale segment of voice services includes fixed-line and mobile call termination services, as well as interconnection for operators whose switched voice network is underdeveloped or non-existent. The wholesale data services segment includes the transportation of data for operators whose network is underdeveloped or non-existent, as well as mobile network services for MVNO operators. The new dark fiber optic infrastructure wholesale market, based on the sale of fiber optic connections, with no service linked to voice or data, is being developed in parallel with the roll-out of FTTH and 4G, and primarily involves horizontal optical fiber links and connection to the backbone. The Group’s major competitor on the French wholesale communications market is Orange. The Group is likewise in competition with conglomerates of telecommunication operators and construction businesses, such as Covage, Altitude, Vinci, Eiffage and Axione (which can put optical fiber cables in their construction works in order to rent them on the wholesale market) as well as with public infrastructure networks. In France, Orange holds a leading position on the wholesale telecommunications market and on the wholesale data market, in which local operators play an important role. _Voice. The wholesale market for voice call services is extremely volatile. Operators generally launch invitations_ to bid annually and choose the provider only according to availability and prices, due to the lack of difference in terms of quality of services between operators in the voice call services sector. Competition consequently primarily occurs for the prices and density of the network, as well as based on the flexibility of operators and their capacity to offer tailored solutions to their customers. On the wholesale voice segment, pricing is generally based on the increased cost pricing model, with interconnection rates established by ARCEP. The regulated interconnection rates have decreased as the telecommunications sector has matured. See “Regulation—The _European regulatory framework for Electronic Communication”. The wholesale voice market likewise includes_ wholesale resales for MVNOs and mobile roaming: ----- _Wholesale resales for MVNOs: The provision of end-to-end mobile services for MVNOs is a major issue for_ operators, and the degree of competition for these services has intensified in recent years. The MVNO wholesale market has evolved, especially after the signing of the first “Full MVNO” contracts in 2011. The status of “Full MVNO” allows virtual operators (for example, NRJ Mobile) to issue their own SIM cards, to have access to the central database managing subscribers’ rights, as well as to certain elements of the network backbone. This model offers MVNOs greater control of services and increased commercial autonomy, but also entails higher costs for them (roll-out, technical maintenance). Moreover, the MVNO agreements have affected the flows of traffic and have led to an increase in the volumes of fixed-line telephony traffic to mobile, which generates higher wholesale prices. In particular, Free’s arrival onto the mobile market in January 2012 has led to a significant increase in call volume from mobile to fixed lines, as well as intra- mobile. _Mobile roaming: In order to continue offering mobile communication services outside of their country of origin,_ operators also negotiate roaming agreements. The communication services within the European Union are subject to price caps on both the retail and wholesale markets. In France, mobile roaming services exist between national operators in so-called “white zone” geographical regions, in which a single operator has rolled out a network and takes in the traffic of other network operators. The roll-out of the mobile network as well as the welcome services related thereto are supervised by ARCEP. _Data services. The wholesale market for data services is less volatile than the voice call services market._ Competition is primarily dependent, aside from price, on the quality of services and technological advances. _Infrastructure. The wholesale market for dark fiber optic infrastructure is more open than the voice connectivity_ and data wholesale markets, given that the provision of these services does not require having a dense national network, and does not include any service that would require technical expertise. For example, certain cities in France have constructed their own local fiber optic networks and are consequently wholesale providers of infrastructure (i.e., they rent the optical fiber to telecommunications operators). The growth of the wholesale market is a result of the growth in the demand for network capacity, which has significantly increased in recent years. Another French market trend consists of developing public-private partnerships between local authorities and infrastructure operators to install or modernize FTTB networks, or roll-out vertical FTTH/FTTO networks. The Group was already selected and hopes to be selected again in the future as the entity in charge of constructing certain new networks, or improving the existing ones. Operators and consortia of operators and construction businesses have also begun to roll out their FTTH vertical fiber networks in residential buildings in order to rent the usage right from these networks to other telecommunications operators in conformity with the so-called status of building operators through public-private partnerships with local authorities, among other things. The Group intervenes in this area thanks to the relationships it has built from its public services activity, since this is one way of maintaining and building relationships with its customers. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

We believe that we are also the leader in terms of 4G mobile antennas in service in France with 46,176 antennas as of June 30, 2020. Due to our strong market position in the mobile telephony market, we are one of the primary convergence operators in France with an attractive “4P” offer (consisting of pay-TV products, broadband internet, fixed telephony and mobile services). We accelerated the build-out of our 4G network over the last two years to have a market-leading mobile network (with a 4G population coverage of 99% as of June 30, 2020). We are already preparing for the introduction of the next generation of mobile telephony with 5G technology. After the first tests carried out in 2016 and 2017, we conducted further tests in different cities in France in 2019, and we, with one of our partners, Nokia, were the first in France to make a 5G New Radio connection using the 3.5 GHz frequency band in 2018. In 2020, the French Government initiated the 5G spectrum auction and the process for such auction includes (i) the allocation of four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each) at a price of €350 million each to qualifying operators; and (ii) a competitive auction process for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz. We have qualified and will be able to obtain five blocks of 10 MHz each. In addition, we intend to bid in the competitive auction for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz each. The allocation of the 11 blocks of 10MHz is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020.

This is reflected in the Group’s ambitious policy of investment in access networks. The Group increased the number of homes passed by fiber/cable (including fiber/cable homes now passed by SFR FTTH, an associate in which the Group owns a 50.01% interest, which we believe to be the largest alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator in France) to approximately 17,457,000 as of June 30, 2020, and intends to continue the expansion of its fiber/cable network in France and capitalize its past investments in improved fiber/cable infrastructure. The Group is also investing heavily in the development of its very-high-speed mobile network. SFR FTTH plans to expand its network in low density areas with more than 5.6 million homes expected to be passed by 2023 (including 2.5 million homes passed as of June 30, 2020), which will be further supplemented following the combination of Covage and SFR FTTH with approximately 2.4 million homes expected to be passed (including 0.9 million homes already built and 0.3 million homes in very dense areas). The Group has expanded its 4G network coverage to approximately 99% of the French population as of June 30, 2020. The Group believes it is the leader in terms of 4G mobile antennas in service in France with 46,176 antennas as of June 30, 2020. In 2020, the French Government initiated the 5G spectrum auction and the process for such auction includes (i) the allocation of four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each) at a price of €350 million each to qualifying operators; and (ii) a competitive auction process for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz. We have qualified and will be able to obtain five blocks of 10 MHz each. In addition, we intend to bid in the competitive auction for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz each. The allocation of the 11 blocks of 10MHz is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. Thus, once the allocation process is completed by the French government, the Group, through SFR, will be among the first players in the market to offer 5G technology to its customers. This ambition is also driven by product innovation. In late 2015, the Group launched a new “all-in-one” box with innovative functions and advanced usages, at the heart of the home (“LaBox”). LaBox is notably equipped with a fiber 1 GB/s modem, a TV 4K/UHD set-top box, a 500 GB hard disk for recording and live-broadcast control, as well as 802.11ac Wifi. Alongside the launch, the Group also unveiled a new simple and ergonomic interface designed to offer the best multi-screen TV viewing experience and meet the needs of its subscribers’ families as well as a new version of the SFR TV application, which offers continuity at home and when on the move. In 2016 and 2017, product innovation continued with the launch of several new pieces of equipment, including a new DSL and FTTH modem offering the latest generation of Wifi. In August 2019, the Group launched the SFR Box 8, integrated with the latest version of WiFi, providing enhanced image and sound (4K HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos) and a vocal assistant, “OK SFR”, to control the box. SFR is proactively developing a policy of enriching the content offered to its customers. In 2018, the Group launched various content options, some of which (SFR Presse, RMC Sport, SFR Ciné séries) are available at a reduced price for SFR broadband and wireless customers. ----- BFM offers access to high quality live news and streaming including all BFM channels (such as BFM Business and BFM Paris), a news sports channel with RMC Sport News and international news with i24 channels in three languages. RMC Sport, a collection of five exclusive sports channels, offers the largest sporting events (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, English Premier League, Premiership rugby, Portuguese Liga, French basketball, combat sports, extreme sports and others). The Group retains exclusive rights to broadcast and distribute premium sports events, including the French Athletics Federation, French Basketball League, European basketball cup, English Rugby Premiership and the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League (from 2018 to 2021). In 2019, the Group obtained non-exclusive broadcast rights to the English Premier League through an agreement between Altice TV and Canal+. In July 2020, we entered into certain arrangements with Mediapro which further enhances our offering of premium sports content to our subscribers, by allowing us to broadcast Mediapro’s channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2). The arrangements with Mediapro are subject to UEFA approval. “Business of the Group—Media” for more information.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.22,Network,123.22.1,Fixed-line network,"_Fiber coverage as of June 30, 2020 Very-high-speed internet_ With regards to very-high-speed internet, the Group is rolling out fiber in all existing technologies (FTTB and FTTH), with the goal of delivering the best quality very-high-speed internet to its subscribers. The Group is actively committed to the success of the French government’s very-high-speed internet plan. With its fiber optic network, the Group provides its subscribers with bit rates of up to 2 GB/s with the SFR Box 8. The Group owns its network infrastructure, headends, access nodes and other parts of its access network, including the long-distance backbone (see “—Backbone”, below). The technical installations in which the cables of the Group’s network are installed (e.g. pylons) are owned by the Group or Orange (to which the Group has access by means of long-term IRUs). Several telecommunications operators can occupy or use the same technical installation or even the same telecommunications equipment, without affecting the quality of the service provided to end subscribers. As of June 30, 2020, the Group had approximately 17,457,000 homes passed eligible for fiber/cable (including homes passed by SFR FTTH). The Group’s fiber/cable services are already marketed in more than 5,500 municipalities across France and in the six months ended June 30, 2020, more than 1,000 municipalities were made eligible for access to the Group’s fiber/cable network. _Fiber to the building (“FTTB”)_ With technical performance levels comparable to those of other FTTx technologies, FTTB is the most widespread technology in the world (including in the United States, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and other countries). ----- FTTB seeks to bring fiber optic as close to housing units as possible and to rely on the existing coaxial cable within buildings to connect the end subscriber to the fiber network. FTTB offers two key benefits: first, it allows for a simplified connection of subscribers and therefore a faster deployment of fiber in France, and secondly it offers a TV service quality recognized to be superior to all other available technologies. _Fiber to the home (“FTTH”)_ Since 2007, the Group has also been deploying its own subscriber connection links by means of FTTH fiber technology, which enables the delivery of bit rates of up to 2 GB/s with the SFR Box 8. The Group’s FTTH technology relies on a network of more than 1,500 optical nodes from which the final links depart to connect its private and business customers in optical fiber. FTTH technology presents a significant technical opportunity given that, as with FTTB, network speed is not technically limited by distances to network connection nodes, unlike other technologies such as VDSL where actual speed decreases as the distance between network connection nodes and the end-user increases. _A pragmatic approach to promote deployment_ In order to meet the growing needs of users, the Group is taking a pragmatic approach to the deployment of its very-high-speed broadband offers. In both very densely populated areas itself, and in less densely populated areas by private partnership, the Group is continuing its fiber deployment where it is the leading operator and it continues to co-invest with Orange in areas where Orange is responsible for deployment. The Group also continues to deploy its very-high-speed network in less densely populated areas as part of public initiative networks with local authorities. Since 2018, the Group was chosen by the Departements of Corse, Gard, Pyrénées Atlantique and Tarn to operate the new Public Initiative Networks that will allow approximately 800,000 households to be connected to the Group’s fiber network. The acceleration of the Group’s fiber deployment in France, notably expanding FTTH coverage in low-density and rural areas, should support better fiber subscriber trends as the addressable market for very high-speed broadband services expands. In order to further accelerate the deployment of FTTH coverage in low density areas, the Group has created SFR FTTH which has the objective of fiber deployment in low density areas. SFR FTTH has also entered into an agreement to acquire all of the equity interest of Covage which will help SFR FTTH expand its footprint in rural areas. _DSL_ In providing its DSL fixed-line broadband services, the Group relies on a DSL network of more than 8,000 unbundled main distribution frames (“MDFs”) as of June 30, 2020. While the Group benefits from what has historically been very good DSL technology coverage, the Group also possesses the French market’s largest fiber optic network and, as a result, is looking to support the migration of subscribers from ADSL to fiber optic technologies in order to meet the gradual increase in residential and business subscribers’ internet usage.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.22,Network,123.22.2,Mobile network,"The Group’s mobile access network has more than 15,000 radio sites (excluding mobile network sharing) as of June 30, 2020, each comprising a transmitter/receiver (the base station), transmission equipment and environment infrastructure (for example, pylons, technical rooms, energy workshops and antennas). These radio sites are relayed to the fiber optic backbone through fiber optic connections or radio connections owned either by the Group or through the network links we lease from Orange. The Group has made investments in mobile frequencies from different mobile spectrum auctions organized by the French regulatory authorities. As a result, the Group has a diversified portfolio of frequencies (which support 2G, 3G and 4G technologies) and a spectrum allocation that covers its current and future mobile network requirements. Following the spectrum auction organized by ARCEP in 2015 for the allocation of frequencies in the 700 MHz band, the Group expanded its spectrum portfolio with a new 5 MHz block. The Group’s low frequency portfolio now comprises 25 MHz in total, broken down into 5 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 800 MHz band and 10 MHz in the 900 MHz band. Together with the 55 MHz the Group owns in high frequencies, the Group’s total portfolio now has 80 MHz (after the refarming of the 1800 MHz band), making it one of the most advanced portfolios on the market. The Group thus believes it will be able to meet subscribers’ coverage and performance ----- needs, in particular in less densely populated areas, with respect to mobile internet and increasing data usage over the coming years. _Mobile coverage_ As a result of significant deployments of its radio sites, the Group aims to cover all mobile connectivity needs in mainland France. As of June 30, 2020, the mobile network of the Group covered 99.8% of the French population in GSM/GPRS (2G) and 99.9% of the population on the UMTS/HSPA (3G/3G+) network. As of June 30, 2020, the Group has access to a 4G network accessible to 99.1% of the population of mainland France and was the first operator to launch 4G technology in France. With a view to increasing download speeds, making internet browsing more enjoyable and improving its service quality, the Group is also deploying 4G+ up to 1 Gb/s. Considered to be an updated version of 4G, 4G+ is able to deliver download rates of a maximum theoretical bit rates of 1 Gb/s due to the aggregation of 800 MHz, 1800 MHz, 2100 MHz and 2600 MHz frequencies and MIMO 4x4 technology. 4G+ technology makes it possible to speed up downloads and facilitates the sharing and viewing of HD content on the go. _4G deployment Systematic deployment of Single-RAN technology_ The Group’s mobile network consists in total of more than 15,000 radio sites (excluding mobile network sharing), equipped with one or more items of transmission/reception equipment (base station), each dedicated to a single technology (2G or 3G) or latest generation equipment (“Single-RAN”), which enables 2G, 3G and 4G technology to be managed by means of a single item of equipment. ----- The Group uses the deployment of 4G technology as an opportunity to systematically replace its older antennas with Single-RAN technology, enabling its subscribers to benefit from a high-quality, very-high-speed network, while also making the most of the technical and financial benefits of Single-RAN technology. Single-RAN technology provides certain technical advantages. First, it enjoys higher performance, both in terms of quality of mobile voice and capacity, due to its ability to use optimal technology (3G/4G) and frequencies (specifically 900MHz). The effectiveness and reliability of its connectivity are also optimized due to the use of unique transmission technology. Secondly, it facilitates technological evolution (such as the introduction of 3G 900 or 4G 1800 for example), due to a simple software development which require no intervention with or amendment to the physical technology components. The use of the Single-RAN technology also provides certain economic benefits, particularly due to the reduced amount of equipment necessary in the Group’s mobile network. As a result, the deployment of Single-RAN technology reduces the amount of mobile network sites required in the Group’s mobile network, reducing the need for investment, and maintenance work on the Group’s network, generating operating savings, whilst at the same time facilitating technological evolution. Finally, Single-RAN technology also improves customer experiences due to the increases in coverage and availability it delivers and the increased capacity over all frequencies and mobile technologies (2G, 3G and 4G). _Mobile networks sharing agreement_ The Group and Bouygues Telecom entered into an agreement on January 31, 2014, whereby they agreed to pool part of their wireless networks. The goal of this agreement is to allow Bouygues Telecom and the Group to offer customers better geographic coverage and service quality, while optimizing costs and investments. The agreement calls for the roll-out of a new shared network in an area corresponding to 57% of the population of France (encompassing the entire territory, other than the 32 largest population centers described above and so-called “white spots”). The first roll-outs of the RAN sharing coverage were in September 2015, and the target network is expected to be completed in 2021. As of December 31, 2019, 11,901 sites have been rolled out jointly by the Group and Bouygues Telecom. See “—Material Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements—Bouygues Telecom _Agreement” for more information. Towers Transaction_ In December 2018, the Group completed the Towers Transaction through which it monetized the value of its passive mobile infrastructure assets. Hivory, the tower company in which the Group owns a 50.01% interest, is a high-quality telecommunications infrastructure provider with a nationwide presence. It is the largest independent telecommunications tower company in France, benefiting from more than 10,000 strategically located sites with a diversified portfolio of ground-based towers and rooftops. Through Hivory, the Group and its joint venture partner KKR seek to proactively partner with third party mobile operators to develop their coverage and densification objectives, including through the build-to-suit of 1,200 new sites by 2022. See “—Material _Contracts—Hivory—Agreement to Dispose of Tower Assets”. 5G Technology_ The Group is preparing the launch of 5G technology. The Group was the first network provider in France to conduct an over-the-air call on a 3GPP-compliant 5G New Radio system using 3.5 Ghz spectrum in 2018, and conducted the first full-scale 5G experiment with a pre-commercial terminal on the Altice Campus in Paris. The Group also conducted the first 5G call on a commercial smartphone in France. The Group continues in 2020 to extend its experiments with field trials in Nantes and Toulouse. Many partnerships (with SNCF and/or certain start-ups) are underway to prepare for the anticipated commercialization of the 5G network from 2020, after, and subject to the outcome of, the spectrum auctions. In 2020, the French Government initiated the 5G spectrum auction and the process for such auction includes (i) the allocation of four blocks of 50 MHz (comprising five blocks of 10 MHz each) at a price of €350 million each to qualifying operators; and (ii) a competitive auction process for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz. We have qualified and will be able to obtain five blocks of 10 MHz each. In addition, we intend to bid in the competitive auction for the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz each. The allocation of the 11 blocks of 10MHz is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.22,Network,123.22.3,Backbone,"In order to offer all its customers a top-quality user experience, the Group has developed its own, unique transport network, enabling the routing of all of the Group’s mobile and fixed-line traffic. The Group’s network is based on a modern, high-quality infrastructure, both with respect to its backbone and its mobile and fixed-line access networks. The Group has one of the largest backbones in France. This backbone is a national transport infrastructure with more than 80,000 km of fiber optic cable enabling the connection of more than 165 metropolitan loops in the territory as of June 30, 2020. In addition, the Group’s backbone is accompanied by a network of 11 national data centers spread across the French territory. _Technical characteristics_ The backbone (which provides the main voice and data transmission routes between large, strategically interconnected networks and the network’s main routers) is used by the Group to route the digital signals of subscribers throughout France. The data backbone currently functions in “All-IP” and transports all Group communication using specific bandwidths for each of the Group’s digital services (residential fixed, residential mobile and business services). The Group believes that its backbone is fully able to meet the needs of its subscribers. _Transmission network and IP transport network_ For its optical transmission network, the Group has chosen a “meshed” architecture, namely one that is constructed in the form of inter-linked loops, thereby securing traffic flow as much as possible. In the past, the Group built its optical transmission network on the basis of national agreements with RFF and Voies Navigables de France. The Group has extended this vast transmission network by also renting fibers to third parties (for example, Réseau de _Transport d’Electricité) and to Orange, specifically for the connection of MDFs._ To be able to handle increasing traffic, the Group has deployed the highest performing optical technology available to date. The Group has constructed an Internet Protocol (“IP”) transport network that is multifunctional and features very high capacity. It is situated above the optical transmission network. The backbone routers use Nx100G technology and as a result can support connections of a unitary capacity of 100 GB/s. The Group network can manage internet services using the addresses in IPv4 or IPv6 format for its Fixed and Wholesale customers. It can also transport voice, data and video flows (for example, television services on multicast IP or VOD).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

These data centers consist of one or more properties equipped with 24-hour security and surveillance services and include several rooms with cabinets containing the servers, kept at an ideal temperature and with permanent electricity supplies. The servers hold the data and applications to be used by business services customers, who benefit from a secured connection to the data center servers.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The Group’s ability to provide new or enhanced fixed-based services, including HDTV and VoD television services, broadband internet network access at increasing speeds and fixedline telephony services as well as UMTS, 3G and 4G mobile services to additional subscribers depends in part on its ability to upgrade its (i) cable and DSL networks by extending the fiber portion of its network, reducing the number of nodes per home passed and upgrading technical components of its network and (ii) mobile networks by building-out its UMTS-network and investing in LTE as well as maintaining agreements with third parties to share mobile networks. In the area of very-high-speed broadband, the Group intends to maintain its competitive edge and contribute to the success of the French government’s very-high-speed internet plan through significant investments into its very-high-speed network and aims to expand its fiber coverage to 22 million homes by 2022. As a result of this investment, the Group intends to continue to lead the market and support residential and business subscribers’ migration from ADSL to fiber technologies. Over the last four years, the Group has increased its fiber deployment and upgraded a substantial part of its cable networks. As of June 30, 2020, the Group’s cable networks are largely DOCSIS 3.0 enabled, which allows it to offer its customers high broadband internet access speeds and better HDTV services across the Group’s footprint. The Group aims to deliver quality experience in broadband and high-speed broadband to all its subscribers both for fixed-line and mobile services. As a result, the Group is investing in its own network infrastructure in order to be able to develop quality, innovative and convergent services while reducing its costs. The Group’s networks not only allow the transmission of both fixed-line and mobile voice and data traffic across France, but they are also interconnected to the networks of the rest of the world due to the Group’s interconnection arrangements or through transiting carriers. The Group intends to continue investing in cutting-edge technologies that make it possible to anticipate market changes and meet future traffic needs. For example, on May 16, 2018, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of ATS France from Altice International, a subsidiary of Altice Europe. See “Certain Relationships and _Related Party Transactions” for more information. ATS France provided services and equipment relating to the_ deployment, maintenance and modernization of the Group’s telecommunications networks. _Overview of architecture of a telecommunications network_ ----- The pace of technological development and evolution in the telecommunications sector is intense and will continue to intensify in the face of rapid changes in consumer internet usage, both through fixed-line and mobile mediums.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.25,Wholesale Market,123.25.1,,"_Overview_ The Group, via its Operator Services Division (“DSO”), is a leading operator next to the incumbent operator in France in wholesale telecommunications services. The Group also has a number of assets in this market, such as the broad spectrum of its catalog, close relationships with its customers and the experience gained over the past several years in this specific market. The Group is involved in the operator market in France and abroad, dealing more specifically with operators serving the residential market, the business services major account market (international and infrastructure operators) and the business services micro business/SME market. ----- At the end of 2014, residential services were impacted by consolidation with the SFR Acquisition and Virgin Mobile Acquisition. This resulted in contraction of the market that can be served by the DSO and, correspondingly, its revenues. However, there remains significant market potential for the DSO, especially through new growth drivers in the very-high-speed fixed-line/mobile broadband and in the contents market. The business services major accounts market remains dynamic, due to, among others factors, the significant increase of speed and the requests for network security by large companies, increasing the sales volume of the DSO in this market, and also its technological evolutions, including the replacement of obsolete copper technology with fiber. The Group’s significant customers in the business services major accounts market are major international incumbent operators. The SME/micro-business business services market is witnessing a number of emerging players every year. This activity has become a preferred target of the incumbent operator. Nonetheless, telecommunications operators in this market have high growth momentum. The biggest operators in this market are now offering their own telecommunications services and positioning themselves with respect to all products from fixed voice to fixed and mobile data. The DSO supports them in these evolutions and partly benefits from this growth. _Solutions offered_ Through the DSO, the Group offers domestic and international operators, and in the real estate space, telecommunications solutions to help them meet the needs of their own residential and business services customers. The Group is currently marketing telecommunications infrastructure solutions, fixed voice solutions, fixed data solutions, white label solutions, mobile solutions, and roaming solutions for foreign operators, contents for FVNO (3P ADSL and Very-High-Speed offer) and MVNO, and infrastructure and digital services solutions to the building. _(a)_ _Infrastructure solutions_ The Group has capacities for IT and telecommunications equipment hosting, which it markets in particular to international players, in addition to the connectivity and data transport solutions. Its infrastructure offer also comprises the marketing of access to its ducts or the provision of fiber optics. This infrastructure allows an operator that wants to develop its own telecommunications network in France to do so using the solutions offered by the Group. _(b)_ _Fixed voice solutions_ The Group meets domestic and international voice transport needs through call transit, collection and termination offers. With these solutions, third-party operators in France can use the Group’s network to connect to the networks of other operators. The Group also offers turnkey solutions to local or national players such as pre-selection, VoIP (end-to-end product offer), resale of the Orange subscription (VGA) and marketing of value-added services (08xx numbers), allowing them to be the single contacts of their end-customers by managing all voice invoices. _(c)_ _Fixed data solutions_ To meet the internet connectivity requirements, the Group offers end-to-end internet access solutions, with or without a router, as well as IP VPN solutions. These solutions allow a third-party operator to use the network and get the Group’s support. The Group also meets collect-mode connectivity needs so that operators can recover data traffic directly on their network. It equally allows international operators to build seamless offers including France in their offerings (international IP VPN). With these solutions, the Group offers dedicated fiber and shared fiber accesses (FTTB, FTTH) and copper accesses (SDSL, ADSL and LL). The Group proposes to be the single point of contact for its operator customers by integrating Orange access and network solutions (fiber and copper) and PIN (Public Infrastructure Network) access and network solutions in order to complete its coverage of data services. ----- _(d)_ _White label solutions_ The Group offers white label broadband and very-high-speed broadband access links in double-play and tripleplay to operators wishing to position themselves in the consumer market. These solutions allow these operators to resell, under their own brand, turnkey solutions to their customers. Triple-play white label service solutions are marketed under long-term contracts and are tailored to the needs and requirements of each of the Group’s customers. These contracts include the provision of television content, internet access services and fixed telephony services. The Group also provides certain other products and services such as handset equipment. _(e)_ _Mobile solutions_ The Group offers comprehensive offers on the MVNO market. These offers are intended for operators without a network that wish to market a mobile offer. The Group offers Full MVNOs (a voice, SMS and data mobile collection offer), MVNOs light (end-to-end mobile services: national, calls abroad, and roaming, among others) and via MVNO aggregators that provided turnkey solutions. _(f)_ _Roaming solutions for foreign operators_ The Group receives roaming traffic of foreign operators on its mobile network in order to ensure continuity of their service in France. The hundreds of agreements that the Group has signed with most foreign mobile operators allow it to cover nearly 258 destinations, and to offer an equivalent service to its subscribers when they are in a foreign country. This roaming solution is also available to MVNOs that wish to benefit from these agreements to meet the needs of their own subscribers. _(g)_ _Content for FVNO and MVNO_ The Group enriches its offerings for FVNO and MVNO by integrating the content developed by the Group (including TV, VoD and press) into its consumer offer. _(h)_ _Infrastructure and digital services solutions for the building_ The Group deploys very-high-speed solutions within existing buildings and in new real estate, mainly targeting residential real estate, service residences and the hospitality space (hotels and clinics, among others). The Group deploys FTTH networks through contracting with the real estate operator for co-owned buildings or low-rent housing and through collective service contracts. The services offered within the framework of collective services allow the residents of the buildings covered to have a maintenance contract enabling them to access, without individual subscription, either the collective television service or a collective triple-play service.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

On June 12, 2017 the Group announced a multi-year partnership with Netflix, which will allow its customers to watch Netflix’s content via eligible devices. Altice Europe and the Group have recently reorganized the corporate organizational structure relating to premium sports content activities and we now hold the rights to broadcast and/or distribute various premium sporting events through our Unrestricted Subsidiary SportCoTV (which was previously held by a subsidiary of Altice Europe outside the Group), including the French Athletics Federation, English Premier League (through an agreement with Canal+), French Basketball League, English Rugby ----- Premiership, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europe League, which are commercialized in France via exclusive SFR branded channels. Furthermore, in July 2020, we entered into certain arrangements with Mediapro which further enhances our offering of premium sports content to our subscribers, by allowing us to broadcast Mediapro’s channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2). For the season 2020/21, we will sub-license the UEFA rights to Mediapro in exchange for the right to distribute Mediapro’s TELEFOOT channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2), which will allow Mediapro to broadcast the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. Both the RMC Sport channel and Mediapro’s TELEFOOT channel will broadcast the two competitions from October 2020. We will be the only operator in France to offer subscribers key French (Ligue 1, Ligue 2) and European (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, English Premier League, Spanish and Italian championships) football. For the seasons 2021/22, 2022/23 and 2023/24, Altice France has entered into a distribution agreement with Mediapro to distribute Mediapro’s TELEFOOT channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2) with a revenue share mechanism. This is expected to generate additional revenues for our residential segment. The arrangements with Mediapro are subject to UEFA approval. We also launched a single brand in July 2018 for all of our sports content: RMC Sport, which replaced the SFR Sport channel. At the end of 2016, Altice Europe and the Group also announced strategic agreements with NBCUniversal International and Discovery which confer certain exclusive distribution rights in France. The Group intends to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to enrich its differentiated and convergent communication services from those of its competitors.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.27,Seasonality,123.27.1,,"With regards to residential activity, the year-end period is a period of extremely sensitive sales. A major defect in information systems or in any component of the production and logistics chain during this period would adversely affect revenues. To prevent this risk, the Group avoids working on the network and information systems during this period of the year (from mid-November until year end). With regards to fixed-line business services activity, revenues from standard analog pay-TV services and basic and high-end cable pay-TV, as well as broadband internet service, are mostly based on fixed monthly pricing and are therefore not subject to seasonal changes. The increase in the number of customers is generally higher from September to January, reflecting a greater tendency for households to equip themselves during back-to-school and year-end periods. Sales to business services customers generally grow in June and December which are periods when private and public-sector businesses create their budgets, while revenues from business services telephony services tend to reflect the timing of school holidays, with a slight drop during summer and winter vacations as well as during May holidays. Revenues from the Group’s content business, which are mainly derived from advertising and, to a lesser extent, the paid circulation of newspapers (subscriptions, newsstand sales), are subject to seasonal variations. For example, the seasonality of advertising revenues can change each year depending on the economic situation, the school calendar, the general news and the ability to preserve advertising space in a context of high level of news as well as, current or sporting events (tournaments and international competitions).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.28,Suppliers,123.28.1,,"The Group has introduced a multi-sourcing purchasing policy for some technologies and permanently monitors suppliers in the production chain. The breakdown of the main suppliers for the major categories is as follows: - ten main suppliers of mobile handsets and customer premises equipment; - five main suppliers of telecommunications equipment; - five primary suppliers for the deployment of this equipment and maintenance; - ten principal suppliers for IT systems; - five main suppliers for call centers. For mobile handsets, the Group works with the best known brands on the market, as well as with Original Design Manufacturers (ODM) for which SFR uses dedicated brands. It is very important for the Group to have access to all the leading brands on the market. Moreover, SFR may, for some very specific products or services, find itself dependent on certain suppliers. SFR considers itself to be commercially dependent on a handset supplier and on an access provider. For customer premises equipment, the Group works with reputed equipment manufacturer, who produce integrated solutions such as LaBox and set top boxes to the specifications of the Group. The Group owns the IP rights to the technology used to manufacture this equipment. ----- For telecommunications equipment, the Group has a dual sourcing policy with leading companies in these markets for the network’s main equipment, particularly radio equipment. As a result, the Group believes that there is no critical dependence. For the backbone, SFR has more of a mono-sourcing policy, based on the type of equipment, in order to simplify the process and because of smaller volumes of investments. The companies concerned are also leaders in their fields. For the information systems, the Group uses either solutions recognized in the market (Oracle, SAP), or more advanced solutions for which specific provisions are stipulated in the contracts in order to protect access to the source code. SFR believes there is no critical dependence in this area. Thus, the Group has developed and maintains relations with various suppliers who contributed to the development of innovations, service quality and operational excellence for its customers to ensure economic efficiency. The purchasing process consists of five stages that describe the entire life cycle of the relationship between the Group and its suppliers. The selection of suppliers is one of the critical steps. It is rigorous and applies objective criteria relating to product and service quality, delivery terms and conditions and their costs as part of the total cost of ownership. This assessment also considers commitments relating to: - compliance with applicable laws and regulations; - compliance with rules of confidentiality and loyalty; - the existence and application of an Environmental and Social Responsibility (ESR) policy suited to the nature of the products and services supplied. These criteria are explicitly set forth in the contracts that govern the Group’s relations with its suppliers. Governance is set up with the principal suppliers. This enables a long-term, balanced relationship to be established and relates to both the monitoring of performance, the sharing and supervising of targets and the exchange of information regarding market and technology trends. The SFR entity has been implementing a purchasing policy that takes into consideration the principles of social and environmental responsibility in its relations with its suppliers in order to improve risk control. The main principles are as follows: - give priority to suppliers that meet these challenges; - take these criteria into consideration in supplier evaluations; and - promote and ensure compliance with the code of ethics and commitments published by the Group. All purchase contracts signed in the last year include a clause on “compliance with laws and regulations—social responsibility”. The Group uses the specialized company AFNOR to evaluate its main suppliers on a regular basis. The use of protected sector businesses (recycling of equipment, telephone contacts, etc.) is an integral part of the purchasing policy and is regularly monitored. As described above, the Group uses several suppliers in the course of its business activities. The Group believes that it is not dependent on any single supplier and that the loss of one of its suppliers would not have any material adverse effect on the Group’s business, and that the Group could replace its main suppliers without any major disturbance to its operations, with the exception of a very small number of suppliers (one terminal supplier and one access supplier). -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

For a subscriber of a telephone network to be able to call an end user located on another telephone network, the subscriber’s network service provider must connect to the end user’s network or to the network that transfers the call to the end user’s network. As a general rule, the operator of the network that is transferring the call and the operator of the end user’s network (if different to the former) bill the subscriber’s service provider for the expenses incurred in transferring traffic and/or call termination. These expenses are calculated based on the rates for call establishment and the duration of the telephone calls. The interconnection rates and expenses are regulated by ARCEP (see “Regulation—Digital single market—National _Regulatory Authorities—ARCEP” for further information)._ The Group has entered into an interconnection agreement with Orange for an indefinite term. The agreement may be terminated by the Group subject to three months’ written notice. The Group has also reached interconnection agreements with other operators for routing traffic. _Unbundling_ Unbundling consists of the supply by Orange of local copper-wire loops to third-party operators, which then install their own transmission equipment on those local copper-wire loops, allowing such operators to ensure end-to-end management of the network connecting it to its customers.

These agreements are generally for renewable three-year terms. Different compensation models are applicable, primarily regarding the provision of non-linear TV offerings (e.g. deferred broadcasts and catch-up TV), with compensation being determined on either a flat-rate price or based on the number of subscribers using such services (the latter of which is the market (and Group) trend). In July 2020, the Group and Altice Europe reorganized the corporate organizational structure for content activities. SportCoTV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, acquired the shares of Altice Pictures, a subsidiary of Altice Europe incorporated in Luxembourg, which holds the rights for sports content, including UEFA champions league and other premium content. Prior to such acquisition, a reorganization of Altice Europe’s structure relating to content activities was carried out, including the transfer of activities performed by AENS, an affiliate of the Group that previously provided the premium sports channels to the Issuer, to Altice Pictures, thereby ensuring that the entire value chain would subsequently be transferred to the Issuer, which is the entity that benefits the most from the marketing of the associated channels. Altice Pictures is expected to be merged into SportCoTV. Therefore, through our Unrestricted Subsidiary SportCoTV, we hold the rights to broadcast and/or distribute various premium sporting events, including the French Athletics Federation, English Premier League (through an agreement with Canal+), French Basketball League, English Rugby Premiership, UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europe League, which are commercialized in France via exclusive SFR branded channels.

This is expected to generate additional revenues for our residential segment. The arrangements with Mediapro are subject to UEFA approval. In order to accommodate the Mediapro arrangements, we are currently in the process of finalizing an amended distribution agreement with SportCoTV, which will be on an arm’s length basis, pursuant to which the Group will broadcast premium sports content. The distribution agreement will provide for, inter alia, a minimum guarantee amount payable by the Group to SportCoTV and a revenue share mechanism over and above such minimum guarantee amount. Prior to the reorganization of the content activities described above, the Group had entered into various arrangements with Altice Europe’s Altice TV division (through its subsidiaries, AENS and Altice Pictures), including (i) exclusive distribution rights in France provided to the Group with respect to a subscription-based VOD service known as “SFR PLAY” produced by Altice TV division; (ii) exclusive distribution rights in France provided to the Group with respect to certain sports and other channels, which included certain exclusive premium sports content; (iii) exclusive distribution rights in France provided to the Group of the following channels Syfy, 13ème Rue, E!; (iv) exclusive distribution rights in France provided to the Group of Discovery Channels; and (v) non-exclusive distribution rights in France provided to the Group of Netflix. On January 8, 2018, Altice Europe announced that existing content wholesale contracts between the Group, and AENS, would be cancelled and replaced by new revenue sharing non-exclusive contracts with a lower guaranteed minimum amount payable by the Group, as applicable (“AENS Contract Renegotiation”). This arrangement included the transfer of other premium content contracts from the Group to AENS and allowed the Group to continue to distribute premium pay-TV content to its customers, including RMC Sport channels, BFM Paris, SFR PLAY, Altice Studio, SyFy, 13ème Rue, E!, Discovery Channels and BeIN. _Handset Supply Agreements_ The Group has entered into a number of agreements through which it procures wireless handsets and accessories.

Under this agreement, the Group was required to roll out fiber to 2.4 million households and Orange is required to roll out fiber optics to 7.6 million households, each by 2020. To avoid any overlaps, the agreement designates for each municipality the operator that is in charge of the rollout, thus ensuring the most optimal timeline and coverage. Each of the parties will become a client of the other by signing IRU agreements in the areas where they will not themselves deploy the fiber. The other operators will have access to these infrastructures through standard operator market agreements. Each party undertakes to cover each municipality within five years of the start of the roll-out. The French Competition Authority’s decision of October 27, 2014 imposed certain obligations on the Group with regards to the implementation of this agreement. As part of the implementation of these commitments, the Group removed part of the exclusivity of deployments from which it benefited on nearly 900,000 homes, thus enabling Orange to supply its own infrastructure in such areas. On June 27, 2018, Orange and SFR announced that they had reached an agreement ratified by the French Competition Authority pursuant to which the two operators have agreed that 80% of the available homes passed would be deployed by Orange and 20% by SFR. The accord was accepted by the French Competition Authority under the condition that non-compliance could expose both operators to a fine reaching up to 3% of revenues ----- derived in France. This commitment, together with the Group’s commitment under the roll agreement, required the Group to roll out fiber to 2.6 million households by 2020. _Agreement Between Bouygues Telecom and the Group Relating to Fiber Optics Roll-Out_ On November 9, 2010 SFR and Bouygues Telecom entered into a joint investment agreement related to fiber optics roll-out (“Faber Agreement”). Under the terms of the Faber Agreement, SFR and Bouygues Telecom committed to jointly invest in the roll-out of a horizontal fiber optic network in a defined number of towns and districts located in high density areas. By Decision No.14-DCC-160 dated October 30, 2014, the French Competition Authority authorized the SFR Acquisition. As part of this decision, the French Competition Authority asked SFR to provide certain commitments related to the Faber Agreement. These commitments covered three main points: - The obligation to provide distribution services for all Distribution Points (DP) delivered as of October 30, 2014 within two years; - The drafting of a rider to the Faber Agreement allowing Bouygues Telecom to order a list of buildings of its choice for the distribution to Distribution Points delivered after October 30, 2014 within three months (excluding performance constraints); and - The provision of maintenance for the FTTH infrastructure in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner using specially introduced quality indicators. By Decision No.15-SO-14 dated October 5, 2015, the Competition Authority officially opened an inquiry into the conditions under which Altice and SFR Group respect these commitments. See “—Legal Proceedings—Civil and Commercial Disputes—Wholesale Disputes—Non-compliance with the _commitments entered into by SFR, in the context of the SFR Acquisition, relating to the agreement concluded between SFR and Bouygues Telecom on November 9, 2010” and “—Legal Proceedings—Civil and Commercial Disputes—Wholesale Disputes—Bouygues Telecom against SFR (Faber CCI)” for more information._",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The goal of this agreement is to allow the Bouygues Telecom and the Group to offer their respective subscribers better geographic coverage and service quality, while optimizing costs and investments. The agreement calls for the roll-out of a new shared network in an area corresponding to 57% of the population of France (encompassing the entire territory, other than the 32 largest population centers with more than 200,000 inhabitants and so-called “white spots”). The agreement is based on two principles: (i) The creation of a special joint venture (Infracos) to manage the assets of the pooled radio sites, i.e. the passive infrastructures and geographic areas where the infrastructures and telecommunications equipment are deployed. The Group and Bouygues Telecom preserve the full ownership of their active telecommunications equipment and frequencies; and (ii) The mutual provision of RAN-sharing service in 2G, 3G and 4G in the shared territory. Each operator is responsible for the part of the territory in which it assures the design, roll-out, operation and maintenance of the RAN-sharing service. Under the agreement, the Group and Bouygues Telecom preserve their own innovation capabilities as well as full commercial and pricing independence, and continue proposing differentiated services due to the control of their ----- network cores and frequencies. The agreement to partially pool wireless networks follows many similar arrangements implemented in other European countries. On January 31, 2014, ARCEP approved the agreement, provided three conditions were met: (i) the preservation of the operators’ strategic and commercial autonomy; (ii) the absence of an eviction effect on certain market competitors; and (iii) an improvement of the services provided to users in terms of both coverage and service quality. The first roll-outs of the RAN sharing coverage were in September 2015, and 11,901 sites were rolled out by December 31, 2019. The Group estimates that as of late December 2019, this agreement corresponded to approximately €1,158 million in commitments given, and approximately €1,607 million in commitments received, for a net commitment of approximately €449 million, covering the entire long-term agreement. The target network completion date is expected to be in 2021. On April 29, 2014, Orange filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority regarding the agreement, arguing that it constituted an anti-competitive practice. Investigations on the merits are currently underway. For more information on the proceedings, see “—Legal Proceedings—Civil and Commercial Disputes—Wholesale _Disputes—Orange v.

Agreement Related to the GSM-R Wireless Telecommunications Network_ The Group holds a 30% share in the company Synérail, along with Vinci Energies and Vinci Concessions (collectively, “Vinci”), AXA Infrastructure Investissement SAS, AXA UK Infrastructure Investissement SAS and AXA Infrastructure Partners FCPR (collectively, “AXA”) and TDF, which signed with the public-private GSMR partnership agreement with RFF. Vinci and AXA each hold a 30% share, while TDF holds the remaining 10%. The agreement, which has a duration of 15 years from March 24, 2010, and an overall value of approximately €1,000 million, consists of ensuring the financing, construction, operation and maintenance of a digital telecommunications network that will assure communications (voice and data) in conference mode between trains and ground controllers. This allows the creation of a European rail network system with a single, compatible and harmonized communication system that replaces existing national radio systems. The network will be progressively deployed along 14,000 km of traditional and high-speed rail lines in France. The Group is also a service provider in the construction and operation phase of the GSM-R network through the companies Synérail Construction and Synérail Exploitation, which it holds jointly with Vinci Energies. In the event of a change in control of the Group, Vinci Energies has a purchase option on the stock of these two companies. This option was not, however, exercised as a result of the SFR Acquisition. _Agreement for the Occupation of the Public Domain of Réseau Ferré de France (“RFF”)_ The Group has entered into a set of agreements with RFF regarding public domain occupation, through which the Group occupies the infrastructures to set up its network.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

On May 15, 2009, the French Competition Authority decided to postpone its decision and remanded the case for further investigation. On August 18, 2011, SFR received a complaint claiming unfair pricing. On December 13, 2012, the French Competition Authority fined SFR €66 million for abuse of dominant position, which SFR has paid. SFR appealed the decision, and the case was argued in the Court of Appeal on February 20, 2014. The Court of Appeal rendered its judgment on June 19, 2014, dismissing SFR’s appeal (the judgment was appealed to the Court of Cassation (the French Supreme Court) by SFR on July 9, 2014 and on October 6, 2015, the Court of Cassation rejected SFR’s appeal), and asked the European Commission to provide an Amicus Curiae brief to shed light on the economic and legal issues raised by this case. The Court of Appeal postponed the ruling on the merits of the case pending the European Commission’s opinion. The European Commission rendered its opinion on December 1, 2014, against SFR. The hearing on the merits of the case was held December 10, 2015. The Court of Appeal delivered its judgment on May 19, 2016, granting a 20% fine rebate to SFR due to the new nature of the infraction. The French Treasury (Trésor Public) returned €13 million to SFR. SFR appealed on a point of law to the Court of Cassation on June 20, 2016. As a result of the French Competition Authority’s decision of December 13, 2012, Bouygues Telecom, OMEA Telecom and EI Telecom (NRJ Mobile) brought suit against SFR in the Commercial Court for damages. SFR and Bouygues Telecom entered into mediation in June 2014 and the hearing to close the mediation proceedings was held on December 5, 2014. The motion for discontinuance granted on September 11, 2014 ended the legal action between the two companies. With respect to the claim by OMEA Telecom (€68 million) and EI Telecom (€29 million), SFR applied for, and obtained, a stay on a ruling pending the decision of the Court of Appeal. On May 24, 2016, OMEA Telecom withdrew its case. EI Telecom reintroduced its case and updated the amount of its loss to up to €28 million. The procedure is pending. _Complaint against Orange to the French Competition Authority regarding the market in mobile telephony services for businesses_ On August 9, 2010, SFR filed a complaint against Orange with the French Competition Authority for anticompetitive practices in the business mobile telephony services market. On March 5, 2015, the French Competition Authority sent a notice of complaints to Orange. Four complaints were filed against Orange. On December 17, 2015, the French Competition Authority ordered Orange to pay a fine of €350 million. On June 18, 2015, SFR filed a suit against Orange in the Commercial Court and is seeking €2,400 million in damages for the loss suffered as a result of the practices in question in the proceedings with the French Competition Authority. A first hearing on the merits of the case was held in February 2020 regarding the fault committed by Orange and the causal link between such fault and the damages suffered by SFR. A second hearing was held in March 2020 regarding the quantum of the damages claimed by SFR. The last hearing for the matter was scheduled for April ----- 29, 2020 regarding the potential indexation of the damages suffered by SFR, however the hearing was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The next hearing is scheduled for October 2, 2020. Due to a change in the court’s composition, it is not clear if this hearing will only concern the potential indexation of the damages or wider issues, and/or if this hearing will be the last hearing. _Non-compliance with the commitments entered into by SFR, in the context of the SFR Acquisition, relating to the agreement concluded between SFR and Bouygues Telecom on November 9, 2010_ Following a complaint by Bouygues Telecom, the French Competition Authority took legal action on October 5, 2015, to examine whether SFR fulfilled its commitments made to the French Competition Authority, in connection with the SFR Acquisition, under the Faber Agreement (the co-investment agreement with Bouygues Telecom) for the deployment of optical fiber in very densely populated areas. A session before the French Competition Authority board was held on November 22, and then on December 7, 2016. On March 8, 2017, the French Competition Authority imposed a financial sanction of €40 million against Altice Europe and the Group for not having complied with the commitments set out in the Faber Agreement at the time of the SFR Acquisition by NC Numericable S.A.S. (now SFR Fibre). This amount was recognized in the Issuer’s consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2016 and was paid during the second quarter of 2017. The French Competition Authority also imposed injunctions, including mandating a new schedule to supply all outstanding access points with progressive penalties imposed in the event of non-compliance. A summary was lodged on April 13, 2017 before the Council of State. The judge in chambers of the Council of State said there is no matter to be referred. On September 28, 2017, the Council of State rejected the application of Altice Europe and the Group for cancellation of the decision of the French Competition Authority. The French Competition Authority is currently monitoring the compliance by SFR of the commitment set out in the Faber Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the Group considers that the risk is difficult to estimate reliably and is hence considered to be a contingent liability under IAS 37 (Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent _Assets). SFR v. Orange: abuse of dominant position in the second homes market_ On April 24, 2012, SFR filed a complaint against Orange with the Paris Commercial Court for abuse of dominant position in the retail market for mobile telephony services for non-residential customers. On February 12, 2014, the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay to SFR €51 million for abuse of dominant position in the second homes market. On April 2, 2014, Orange appealed the decision of the Commercial Court on the merits. On October 8, 2014, the Court of Appeal overturned the Paris Commercial Court’s ruling and dismissed SFR’s requests. The Court of Appeal ruled that it had not been proven that a pertinent market limited to second homes actually existed. In the absence of such a market, there was no exclusion claim to answer, due to the small number of homes concerned. On October 13, 2014, SFR received notification of the judgment of the Court of Appeal of October 8, 2014 and repaid the €51 million to Orange in November 2014. On November 19, 2014, SFR appealed the ruling. On April 12, 2016, the French Supreme Court quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and referred the case to the Court of Appeal. Orange returned €53 million to SFR on May 31, 2016. Orange reintroduced the case in the Court of Appeal of Paris on August 30, 2016. On June 8, 2018, the Court of Appeal rejected Orange’s appeal. On December 24, 2018, Orange refiled an appeal with the Supreme Court. SFR filed its conclusions in defense on February 15, 2019. The case is still pending. _SCT against SFR_ On October 11, 2017, SCT summoned the Group before the Paris Commercial Court alleging certain dysfunctions and failings in the delivery of the Group’s Fixed services, and the loss of certain clients as part of the supply of MVNO services. ----- SCT is claiming damages in the amount of approximately €48 million (comprised of €25 million for the fixed services, €15 million for loss of clients, €2 million for loss of revenues, €1 million for deployment delays, €4 million for dysfunctions which led a negative impact on their internal management, €1 million for overcharging, €1 million for purchases with Orange and €200,000 for damages to their image). This case was subject to a conciliation proceeding between the parties. After the failure of this proceeding, the case was sent to be tried on the merits and the procedure is still pending.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

SFR: unfair practices for non-compliance with consumer credit provisions in a subsidized offer_ On May 21, 2012, Free filed a complaint against SFR in the Paris Commercial Court. Free challenged the subsidy used in SFR’s “Carrés” offers sold over the web between June 2011 and December 2012, claiming that the subsidy constituted a form of consumer credit and, as such, SFR was therefore liable for unfair practices by not complying with the consumer credit provisions, in particular in terms of providing relevant information to customers. Free asked the Paris Commercial Court to order SFR to provide customers with the relevant information and pay damages. On January 15, 2013, the Commercial Court dismissed all of Free’s requests and granted SFR €300,000 in damages. On January 31, 2013, Free appealed the decision. On March 9, 2016, the Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Paris Commercial Court and dismissed all of Free’s claims. The amount of the compensation to be paid by Free to SFR increased from €300,000 to €1 million. On May 6, 2016, Free filed an appeal. SFR’s defense was filed on November 8, 2016. The Court of Cassation rendered a decision on March 7, 2018. This decision overturned and partially cancelled the decision rendered by the Court of Appeal and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Cassation considered that the Court of Appeal had based its prior judgment on improper motives to exclude the mobile subsidy provided by the Group on its subscriptions from the scope of consumer credit. In addition, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed the order requiring Free mobile to pay €1 million for the defamation suffered by the Group. Free referred the matter to the Second Court of Appeal. On April 24, 2019, the Second Court of Appeal ruled that the “Carrés” offer was to be considered a form of consumer credit and therefore SFR is consequently liable for unfair commercial practices. However, the Court dismissed Free from its other claims and an expert opinion has been requested by the Court to determine the damage suffered by Free (Free claimed €98 million in damages). This expert opinion is pending. _SFR v. Iliad, Free and Free mobile: unfair practices by disparagement_ On May 27, 2014, SFR filed a complaint against Iliad, Free and Free Mobile in the Paris Commercial Court for unfair competition, claiming that since Free Mobile was launched, Iliad, Free and Free Mobile were liable for unfair practices by disparaging SFR’s services. SFR claimed €493 million in damages. On September 9, 2016, Free argued that SFR denigrated their capacities and services and claimed €475 million in damages. The Paris Commercial Court rendered its judgment on January 29, 2018. The Court ordered Free Mobile to pay to SFR €20 million as moral damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. In addition, the Paris Commercial Court ordered that SFR pay €25 million to Free Mobile as moral and material damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. Accordingly, the Court ordered, as compensation, SFR to pay to Free Mobile €5 million as damages. This decision was executed and the Group paid the €5 million net amount to Free Mobile in June 2018. SFR appealed this decision and the case is still pending. _Disputes regarding the transfer of customer call centers from Toulouse, Lyon and Poitiers_ Following the transfer of customer call centers in Toulouse and Lyon to Infomobile, and the transfer of the Poitiers call centers to a subsidiary of the Bertelsmann Group, the former employees at those sites filed legal actions at Human Rights Tribunals in each respective city, claiming that their employment contracts were unfair and ----- constituted fraud under Article L. 1224-1 of the French Code du travail (the “French Labor Code”) and that their dismissals were in breach of the legal provisions regarding dismissal for economic reasons. The rulings in 2013 were mixed. The Toulouse Court of Appeals penalized SFR and Téléperformance in half of the cases, while the Lyon and Poitiers courts ruled in favor of SFR. The cases are now at various stages of proceedings in the Labor Tribunal, Court of Appeals and Court of Cassation. _Litigation over distribution in the independent network (consumer market and SFR’s Business Team)_ Like many other companies operating an indirect distribution model, SFR faces complaints from a number of its current and former distributors. These complaints revolve around claims of sudden breach of contract, unfair economic dependency and/or demands for requalification as a sales agent, as well as, more recently, demands for requalification as a contractual branch manager and requalification as SFR-contracted point-of-sale staff. _Free v. SFR_ In July 2015, Free filed suit against SFR seeking to prevent SFR from using the word “Fiber”, claiming that the solution marketed by SFR is not a fiber to the home (FTTH) solution. Free considers SFR’s communication to be deceptive about substantial qualities and, on that basis, is asking the court to find that SFR is engaging in freeriding and unfair competition. On January 19, 2018, a decision was rendered requesting SFR to: - pay €1 million as moral damages; - communicate, within 90 days following the date of the judgment notification, to each client having subscribed to SFR or Numericable, an offer including the term “fiber” (excluding FTTH offers) on IT support and paper support information relating to (i) the precise nature of its connection to optical fiber; (ii) the number of subscribers sharing coaxial connection; and (iii) the average connection speed at peak hours and off-peak hours; - inform, within 90 days following the date of the judgment notification, each client having subscribed to SFR or Numericable, an offer including the term “fiber” (excluding FTTH offers) that they benefit from a possibility of immediate termination as a result of default in previous information provided about the exact characteristics of the offer; and - pay €120,000 pursuant to article 700 of the French Code of Commerce. The court considered that it made a material error in failing to mention provisional enforcement in the judgment. Accordingly, the court decided, by judgment dated February 12, 2018, that provisional enforcement applies for all convictions in this case. Despite its appeal before the Court of Appeal of Paris, SFR was obliged to execute the judgment. Free challenged SFR’s proper execution of the judgment and referred the matter to the enforcement judge which confirmed the proper execution of the ruling by SFR. Free appealed this decision and the proceedings are still pending.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In announcing the opening of this in-depth investigation, the European Commission indicated that it believes that the sale of public assets to a private company without proper compensation gives the latter an economic advantage not enjoyed by its competitors, and that it therefore constitutes government aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union. The free-of-charge transfer of the cable networks and ducts by 33 French municipalities to SFR Fibre, therefore, it was argued, confers a benefit of this type and constitutes government aid. The European Commission has expressed doubts about the compatibility of the alleged aid with the rules of the European Union. The Group ----- firmly denies the existence of any government aid. In addition, the decision to open an investigation concerns a relatively small number of network connections (approximately 200,000), the majority of which have not been migrated to EuroDocsis 3.0 and only allow access to a limited number of the Group’s television services. The European Commission’s decision of July 17, 2013 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on September 17, 2013. Since then, discussions have continued within the framework of this process both in terms of comments from third parties as well as those from the parties to the proceedings as to the allegation of the existence of aid and its extent, with the Group firmly challenging the existence of any government aid. _Actions by Colt, Free and Orange against the European Commission regarding DSP 92_ Colt, Free and Orange filed three separate motions against the European Commission before the General Court of the European Union (“GCEU”) seeking to annul the European Commission’s final decision of September 30, 2009 (Decision C(2009) 7426), which held that the compensation of €59 million granted for the establishment and operation of a high-speed electronic communications network in the department of Hauts-de-Seine does not constitute state aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union. The Group is not party to these proceedings. The Issuer’s subsidiary Sequalum, as well as the French government and the department of Hautsde-Seine, are acting as civil parties. In three rulings dated September 16, 2013, the GCEU dismissed all three actions and confirmed the aforementioned decision of the European Commission. Free and Orange have appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The procedure is pending. _Litigation between Sequalum and Hauts-de-Seine General Council regarding DSP 92_ A disagreement arose between the Hauts-de-Seine General Council and Sequalum regarding the terms of performance of a utilities concession contract (“THD Seine”) signed on March 13, 2006 between Sequalum, a subsidiary of the Group, and the Hauts-de-Seine General Council, to create a very-high-speed fiber optic network in the Hauts-de-Seine region. The Hauts-de-Seine General Council decided in its on October 17, 2014 meeting to terminate the public service delegation agreement signed with Sequalum “for gross misconduct by the delegatee for which it is solely responsible”. By two judgments dated March 16, 2017, the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise rejected the actions brought by Sequalum against the two demands issued by the Hauts-de-Seine General Council for the penalties in the amounts of €52 million and €45 million. Sequalum appealed the two decisions before the Administrative Court of Versailles, but paid €97 million over the month of July 2017. On October 16, 2014, Sequalum filed a motion in the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise to have the public service delegation rescinded on the grounds of force majeure due to irreversible disruption of the contract, and for a payment of compensation. Sequalum claimed that the termination was unlawful, and continued to perform the contract, subject to any demands that the delegator may impose. If the courts decide against Sequalum, Sequalum may have to (i) repay the public subsidies received for the DSP 92 project, equal to the outstanding component of the subsidies (Sequalum has received €25 million in subsidies from the Hauts-de-Seine General Council), (ii) reimburse any deferred income (estimated to be €32 million by the Department of Hauts-de-Seine) and (iii) compensate the Department of Hauts-de-Seine for damages suffered (estimated to be €212 million by the Department of Hautsde-Seine). The Hauts-de-Seine General Council received the returnable assets of the DSP 92 project on July 1, 2015. If the courts decide in favor of Sequalum, the Hauts-de-Seine General Council would have to pay compensation to Sequalum in an amount equal to the net value of the assets. On December 31, 2015, the assets were removed from Sequalum’s account in an amount of €116 million. A receivable in the amount of €139 million related to the expected indemnification due to Sequalum was also recognized and fully provisioned. On July 11, 2016, the Department of Hauts-de-Seine issued a detailed account of all sums it believed to be due by each party in respect of the various disputes, and issued securities on the basis of the said account. The various sums were the subject of a decision of the public accountant dated July 13, 2016, with the final approved amount totaling €182 million. This statement, the securities and the compensation decision were the subject of motions ----- for annulment filed by Sequalum before the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise on September 10, 12 and 14, 2016. These applications remain pending, except for the application for annulment relating to the breakdown (the Court having considered that the breakdown was not a measure which could be appealed but Sequalum appealed this decision before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeals). The Group outlined that it had its own optical fiber in the Haut-de-Seine department enabling it to serve its customers. In September 2017, the department issued three revenue orders (titres de recette) in order to minimize the balance due to Sequalum at the time of counting. The following demands were contested: - Order of an amount of €23 million for the unamortized portion of the subsidies (SFR’s appeal was dismissed); - Order of an amount of €32 million for deferred income (SFR’s appeal was successful); and - Order of an amount of €6 million for amounts received as prepayment for connections (SFR’s appeal was dismissed). The Department issued a revenue order of €212 million for damages suffered as a result of the faults based on which the contract was terminated. The judgment was rendered on February 15, 2018, and reduced the indemnity by €187 million and the amount of the revenue order to €25 million. The department appealed this decision. The judgement rendered on July 5, 2018 granted Sequalum’s request for the cancellation of the compensation. On the other hand, the request for repayment was rejected. This rejection has been appealed by Sequalum. The Group is currently negotiating with the Department. _Iliad/Free gun-jumping litigation against Altice Luxembourg, the Group, SFR and SFR Fibre_ On April 5, 2019, the Issuer and Altice Luxembourg, _inter alios, received a claim from Free stating that the practices sanctioned by the French Competition Authority in November 2016 in the SFR Fibre/SFR/Virgin Mobile gun jumping case caused Free to lose the tender process for the acquisition of Virgin Mobile. Free is now seeking €216 million in monetary damages. The Issuer has requested certain documents from Free to understand the rationale for the damages claimed by Free. At this stage, the Group strongly challenges the merits of this claim. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,123,"INDUSTRY, COMPETITION AND MARKET OVERVIEW",123.38,,123.38.1,,"_Industry Overview_ The French telecommunications market is the third largest in Europe (Source: Paul Budde Communication Pty _Ltd, www.budde.com.au; France—Telecoms, Mobile and Broadband—Statistics and Analyses, October-2019),_ with revenues of approximately €35.2 billion in the last twelve months leading to March 31, 2020 (Source: _ARCEP). While the Group operates in all segments of the French telecommunications market, its activity focuses_ on fixed-line very-high-speed internet, pay-TV, mobile and next-generation B2B services (advanced data services, IP VPN, hosting and cloud services). France is one of the largest European fixed-line high-speed internet markets, with nearly 29.9 million fixed-line high-speed subscriptions as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). Higher bandwidth is becoming increasingly important for B2C. While only 40.1% of broadband lines were very-high-speed lines as of March 31, 2020, in France, access to very high speed internet continues to rapidly increase with a 25.7% increase in very high speed subscriptions over the last twelve months (Source: ARCEP). As of March 31, 2020, 7.7 million households had access to very-high-speed optical FTTH (Source: ARCEP). Including other alternatives (HFC, VDSL2), 8.8 million households had access to very-high speed fixed services as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). In the mobile market, the total number of SIM cards (excluding M2M SIM cards) increased, from 75.8 million cards as of March 31, 2019, to 77.1 million cards as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP), with growth driven primarily by the postpaid segment. This growth has been sustained by an increase in the rate of penetration of mobile phones, smartphones and tablets and the growth of quadruple play offers. The value of the French mobile market, which was declining since 2011 after the fourth mobile telephony operator entered the market in early 2012, contributing to a drop in the pricing of mobile offers in France, has stabilized and increased in the last year (3.0% increase from Q1-2019 to Q1-2020) (Source: ARCEP). In both the B2C and B2B segments, data usage has increased and data needs have become more complex, as the next-generation services require higher speeds and bandwidth capacity. _B2C market_ The Group is present in metropolitan France, which as of January 1, 2020 had a population of approximately 64.9 million residents (Source: INSEE). The French B2C internet access segment is a mature one, with 29.9 million fixed-line high-speed subscriptions as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). In terms of very-high-speed internet access, which ARCEP defines as internet access for which the peak download speed is greater or equal to 30 Mbps, the French market nevertheless presents a relatively low rate of penetration, with only 40.1% of households having very-high-speed internet access as of March 31, 2020 (Source: ARCEP). The Group estimates that such under-penetration could constitute an attractive opportunity for growth, as B2C subscribers are beginning to favor higher speed and bandwidth capacity for their internet use. The French high-speed internet access market is one of the most competitive in Europe, with significant unbundling and strong incumbent competitors. The Orange fixed-line network includes a local loop serving the entire French population, and the unbundling allows other DSL access providers to access it at a price that is regulated by ARCEP. According to ARCEP, as of March 31, 2020, 11.0 million lines were unbundled (with 85.9% of all lines being totally unbundled). All operators reputed to exert significant influence are required to offer unbundled access to their local loop and associated infrastructure under non-discriminatory conditions, which leads to increased competition on the market. See “Regulation—Asymmetric regulation of the fixed telephony _markets and fast and superfast broadband markets”._ The competition on the B2C market has intensified after the president of Bouygues Telecom announced in December 2013 his intention to launch a price war on fixed-line internet offers in 2014, following Free’s ads for its 4G offers and the results of its competitors. Bouygues Telecom introduced a triple play offer at €19.99 per month in February 2014, and in July 2014 launched a FTTH offer at €25.99 including tax per month, with no commitment in terms of duration. In March 2015, Iliad announced the release of a new triple play box under Android TV[™], the mini 4K, at the price of €29.99 per month, with no commitment in terms of duration. ----- As of June 30, 2020, Orange, Free (Iliad) and Bouygues Telecom reported a volume of subscribers with broadband services of 11.8 million, 6.6 million and 4.0 million respectively (Source: June 2020 earnings releases). The French B2C mobile telephony market is a mature market, even though it has experienced significant changes in recent years, with the entry of a fourth mobile telephony operator in January 2012. The penetration rate of mobile telephony (excluding M2M SIM cards) in France has continued to increase, in line with historical trends, from approximately 109.7% as of December 31, 2016 for the entire population, to 111.8% as of December 31, 2017, 112.8% as of December 31, 2018, 118.9% as of December 31, 2019 (Sources: ARCEP, INSEE).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Since then, we have, from time to time, made significant direct and indirect equity investments in, and divestments of, certain businesses, including, among others, the acquisition of a controlling interest in Next Radio T.V. in 2016 and the remaining interest therein in 2018, the disposal of i24News and acquisitions of FOT, ACS and ATS in 2018. In addition, in 2018, the Group entered into certain strategic transactions such as the sale of its 49.99% interests in SFR FTTH and the Towers Transaction. In 2019, SFR FTTH (an associate of the Group) entered into an exclusivity agreement with Cube Infrastructure Fund and Partners Group (acting on behalf of its clients) regarding the acquisition of all of the equity interests in Covage and the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020. Due to the significant nature of certain of these acquisitions and disposals, the comparability of our results of operations based on the Historical Consolidated Financial Information may be affected. See “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of _Operations—For the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019— Significant Events Affecting Historical Results”, “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results” and “—Discussion and Analysis of Our Results of Operations—For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017—Significant Events Affecting Historical Results”._ In general, our results of operations in historical periods have been impacted by actions taken and expenditures incurred to integrate these businesses. We have aimed to integrate and improve the businesses by focusing on several key areas including by (i) investing in the Group’s fiber network, migrating existing DSL subscribers to the Group’s own network and reducing the need for third party network services, (ii) improving and simplifying operational processes and reduce IT costs by investing in new platforms, (iii) integrating sales organizations, optimizing the Group’s sales channels and simplifying the Group’s brand portfolio, (iv) implementing procurement efficiencies by leveraging the Group’s bargaining power and (v) reducing overhead costs. At the core of our strategy is revenue, profitability and cash flow growth and, as a result, deleveraging. We benefit from a unique asset base which is fully-converged, fiber rich, media rich, active across consumers and businesses and holds the number two position in its market with nationwide fixed and mobile coverage. The reinforced operational focus offers significant value creation potential. In 2018 and 2019, we have successfully completed disposal of certain non-core assets. Key elements of our growth strategy have included: - Operational and financial turnaround under the leadership of a new management team; - Optimizing commercial performance with a particular focus on customer services; - Continuing to invest in best-in-class infrastructure commensurate with our market position; - Monetizing content investments through various pay-TV models and growing advertising revenue; and - Execution of the non-core asset disposal program, including part of our mobile tower portfolio. ----- For the six months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, we incurred restructuring and other non-recurring cost of €26 million and income of €2,745 million, respectively. Costs primarily include costs with respect to renegotiations or termination of contractual arrangements, employee redundancies, fees paid to external counsel, capital gain or loss on investing activities and other administrative expenses related to reorganization of existing or newly acquired businesses, as well as specific COVID-19 pandemic related costs. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, income mainly includes a capital gain related to the divestment of a 49.99% stake in SFR FTTH for an aggregate amount of €2,796 million. In addition, we generally record goodwill relating to acquisitions. As of June 30, 2020, the goodwill recorded on our balance sheet amounted to €11,043 million (compared to €11,076 million as of December 31, 2019). Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews in accordance with IFRS and any impairment charge on goodwill would have a negative impact on operating profit.

Customers who elect to subscribe for our multi-play bundles rather than our individual services realize comparative cost savings on their monthly bill. We believe that the enhanced value proposition associated with our bundled services enables us to meet our customers’ communication and entertainment requirements while concurrently both increasing customer loyalty and attracting new customers. As a result of our focus on providing subscribers with multi-play bundles, we have experienced an increase in the number of our fiber/cable customer relationships. We believe our bundled service offerings will be an important driver of our fixed-based services, partially offsetting the continued pressure on traditional fixed-based services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.3,Introduction of New Products and Services and Investment in Content,"We have significantly expanded our presence and product and service offerings in the past. In particular, we have launched new offers with new sports and other content in order to differentiate our product offering and to underline our investment in sports rights and other nonlinear content. In addition, we regularly review and invest in the content that we offer to provide our subscribers with a flexible and diverse range of programming options, including high-quality local content and exclusive premium content. Altice Europe has acquired the exclusive rights to broadcast and distribute various premium sporting events, including the English Premier League (through an agreement with Canal+), French Basketball League and English Rugby Premiership, which are commercialised in France via exclusive RMC branded channels. On July 7, 2020, SportCoTV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer, acquired the shares of Altice Pictures, a subsidiary of Altice Europe incorporated in Luxembourg, which holds the rights for sports content, including UEFA champions league and other premium content. Prior to such acquisition, a reorganization of Altice Europe’s structure relating to content activities was carried out, including the transfer of activities performed by AENS, an affiliate of the Group that previously provided the premium sports channels to the Issuer, to Altice Pictures, thereby ensuring that the entire value chain would subsequently be transferred to the Issuer, which is the entity that benefits the most from the marketing of the associated channels. Altice Pictures is expected to be merged into SportCoTV. In July 2020, we entered into certain arrangements with Mediapro which further enhances our offering of premium sports content to our subscribers, by allowing us to broadcast Mediapro’s channel (including the main football matches for French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2). The arrangements with Mediapro are subject to UEFA approval. In order to accommodate the Mediapro arrangements, we are currently in the process of finalizing an amended distribution agreement with SportCoTV, which will be on an arm’s length basis, pursuant to which the Group will broadcast premium sports content. The distribution agreement will provide for, inter alia, a minimum guarantee amount payable by the Group to SportCoTV and a revenue share mechanism over and above such minimum guarantee amount. We also launched a single brand in July 2018 for all of our sports content: RMC Sport, which replaced the SFR Sport channel. At the end of 2016, Altice Europe and the Group also announced strategic agreements with NBCUniversal International and Discovery which confer certain exclusive distribution rights in France. Furthermore, the Group has formed a partnership with Discovery Communications to launch two new exclusive Discovery channels and has obtained exclusive distribution rights to two existing Discovery channels, including the number one factual pay-TV channel in France, and three NBCUniversal channel brands in metropolitan France. Leading 24-hour news is also provided by the Group through its TV news hub bundle, BFM. In June 2017, we entered into a multi-year partnership with Netflix to deliver Netflix’s range of critically acclaimed series, movies, documentaries, stand-up comedy and children’s programming to our customers in ----- France. We intend to continue to selectively invest in local and value-added premium content as well as sports broadcasting and distribution rights in the future to enrich our differentiated and convergent communication services from those of our competitors. We believe that such efforts will reduce our customer churn and increase revenue. In March 2019, we redesigned our offers by simplifying them and more closely aligning their content to those of our competitors. Offers are now built around two separate focuses: one centered around telecoms and one centered around premium content. These are offered as paid options, at a preferential rate for SFR customers, for fixed and mobile offers. The benefits of this strategy are seen in a significant uplift in gross-adds for customers taking content options and this trend was strengthened further as key content was added with the Champion’s League in the third quarter of 2018. We expect to leverage this strategy with the addition of new premium sports content following the arrangement with Mediapro.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.4,Pricing,"We focus our product offerings on multi-play offers. In France, we offer multiple play (4P) offers at various price points based on the targeted clientele (low cost, no engagement period offers through our RED brand and more premium offers with the SFR brand). The French market remains highly competitive and hence extremely sensitive to pricing strategy. The cost of a multi-play subscription package generally depends on market conditions, our competitors’ pricing of similar offerings and the content and add-ons available on each platform. In general, the greater the optionality, content and usage time included in the offering, the higher the price of the multi-play package. The prices of B2B contracts are negotiated individually with each customer. The B2B market for voice services is extremely price-sensitive and entails very low margins as voice services are highly commoditized, involving sophisticated customers and relatively short-term contracts. The B2B market for data services is less price-sensitive, as data services require more customization and involve service level agreements. In both markets, price competition is strongest in the large corporate and public-sector activities, whereas customer-adapted solutions are an important competitive focus in the medium and small business activities. We have tailored our targeted pricing strategy to account for these dynamics in France.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

We continuously work towards optimizing our cost base by streamlining processes and service offerings, improving productivity by centralizing our business functions, reorganizing our procurement process, eliminating duplicative management functions and overhead, terminating lower-return projects and non-essential consulting and third-party service agreements, and investing in our employee relations and our culture. We are implementing common technological platforms across our networks to gain economies of scale, notably with respect to billing systems, network improvements and customer premises equipment and are investing in sales, marketing and innovation, including brand-building, enhancing our sales channels and automating provisioning and installation processes.

Since 2015, we have increased our fiber deployment and upgraded a substantial part of our cable networks. For example, as of June 30, 2020, our cable networks are largely DOCSIS 3.0 enabled, which allows us to offer our customers high broadband internet access speeds and better HDTV services across our footprint. The Group has also accelerated the build-out of its 4G network over the last three years to have a market-leading mobile network in place by the end of June 2020 (4G population coverage of 99% as of June 30, 2020), and is already preparing for the introduction of 5G technology. The Group also aims to continue the expansion of its fiber network in France and intends to capitalize on its past investments in improved fiber infrastructure. Moreover, SFR FTTH plans to expand its network in low density areas with more than 5.6 million homes expected to be passed by 2023 ----- (including 2.5 million homes passed as of June 30, 2020), which will be further supplemented following the combination of Covage and SFR FTTH with approximately 2.4 million homes expected to be passed (including 0.9 million homes already built and 0.3 million homes in very dense areas). In each of the past three years, we have incurred significant capital expenditure (between 21-23% of total consolidated revenues) in order to improve our mobile network and to roll out new fiber homes. Our accrued capital expenditure amounted to €979 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 and €1,147 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.2.7,Competition,"We face significant competition and competitive pressures in the French market. Moreover, our products and services are subject to increasing competition from alternative new technologies or improvements in existing technologies. With respect to our B2C activities, we face competition from telephone companies and other providers of DSL, VDSL2 and fiber network connections. With respect to pay-TV services, we are faced with growing competition from alternative methods for broadcasting television services other than through traditional cable networks. For example, online content aggregators which broadcast over-the-top (“OTT”) programs on a broadband network, such as Internet competitors Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix, are expected to grow stronger in the future. Connected or ‘smart’ TVs facilitate the use of these services. With respect to the fixed line and mobile telephony markets, the industry has experienced a shift in usage from fixed line telephony to mobile telephony and we face intensive competition from established telephone companies, MVNOs and providers of new technologies such as VoIP. In the French pay-TV market, we compete with providers of premium television packages such as CanalSat, DSL 3P and/or 4P operators such as Orange, Free and Bouygues Telecom, which provide internet Protocol TV (“IPTV”), and providers of pay digital terrestrial television (“DTT”). In the broadband market, we compete primarily with xDSL, though increasingly with fiber providers such as Orange (the leading DSL provider in France), Free and Bouygues Telecom. Our competitors continue to invest in fiber network technology which has resulted in additional competition to its fiber-based services. In the French mobile telephony market, we compete with well-established mobile network operators such as Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Free, as well as other MVNOs such as La Poste. In particular, price competition is significant since entry into the market by Free in early 2012 with low-priced no frills packages. Moreover, the competition in the fixed market has deteriorated recently with more aggressive promotions from competitors for longer periods, particularly at the low end of the market. However, while the acceleration of our fiber deployment in France, notably expanding FTTH coverage in low-density and rural areas, should support better fiber subscriber trends as the addressable market for very high-speed broadband services expands, FTTH deployment by the our competitors could accelerate and the share of FTTH on the high-speed internet market could grow significantly thereby eliminating or reducing our fixed network advantage. In the wholesale market, we compete with established players (the incumbent Orange mainly), and with local operators (including Covage, and Altitude Telecom, among others).In the competitive B2B data services market, price pressure has been strong. Conversely, the use of data transmission services has significantly increased. We are currently facing competition from software providers and other IT providers of data and network solutions, and the line between them and the suppliers of data infrastructure and solutions like us have become increasingly blurred. Partnerships between IT providers and infrastructure providers are becoming more and more common and are an additional source of competition but also an opportunity. Being able to face the competition efficiently depends in part on the density of the network, and certain competitors have a broader and denser network. In recent years, the B2B market has experienced a structural change marked by a move from traditional switched voice services to VoIP services.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Income Statement Items,17.4.1,Revenue,"Revenue consists of income generated from the delivery of fixed-based services to our B2C and B2B customers, mobile services to our B2C and B2B customers, wholesale and other services. Revenue is recognized at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating intercompany sales within the Group. _Revenue by operating activity The below is relevant for the purposes of the discussion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 and the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2019._ On January 1, 2019, we amended the presentation of our revenue derived from operational activities, presenting revenue by activity under “Residential—Fixed,” “Residential—Mobile,” “Business Services,” “Equipment Sales” and “Media” which we believe more accurately reflects the current day-to-day operational and strategic divisions in which our business is managed. For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue derived from operational activities was presented under “Mobile Services,” “Mobile Equipment,” “Fixed,” “Wholesale,” “Media” and “Other.” For comparative purposes, we have revised the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2018. Residential—Fixed:_ Revenue from fixed-based services consists of revenue from pay-TV services, including related services such as Video on Demand (“VoD”), broadband internet services, fixed-line telephony services and ISP services to our customers. This primarily includes (i) recurring subscription revenue for pay-TV services, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony (which are recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period), (ii) variable usage fees from VoD and fixed-line telephony calls (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered), (iii) installation fees (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered if consideration received is lower than the direct costs to acquire the contractual relationship) and (iv) interconnection revenue received for calls that terminate on our cable network. Residential—Mobile:_ Revenue from mobile telephony services primarily consists of (i) recurring subscription revenue for our post-paid mobile services (which are recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period), (ii) revenue from purchases of our pre-paid mobile services (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered), (iii) variable usage fees for mobile telephony calls (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered), (iv) revenue from the sale of handsets (which are recognized on the date of transfer of ownership) and (v) interconnection revenue received for calls that terminate on our mobile network. _Business Services: Revenue from wholesale services primarily consists of revenues derived from renting our_ network infrastructure services, including IRUs and bandwidth capacity on its network, to other telecommunications operators, including MVNOs as well as related maintenance services. Revenue from B2B services is the same as the above fixed and mobile services, but for the business sector. This segment also includes revenues from our other services primarily consists of revenue from businesses such as (i) datacenter activities, (ii) content production and distribution, (iii) customer services, (iv) technical services and (v) other activities that are not related to our core fixed or mobile businesses. _Equipment Sales: Revenue from equipment sales consist of revenue from sale of equipment in residential and_ business services. _Media: Revenues from the media segment includes mainly advertising and subscription revenues derived from_ news, radio and printed press businesses. ----- _Intersegment Eliminations: Intersegment costs, which primarily relate to services rendered by certain centralized_ Group functions (such content production and customer service) to the operational segments of the Group, are eliminated in consolidation. _The below is relevant for the purposes of the discussion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017._ On January 1, 2018, we amended the presentation of our revenue derived from operational activities, presenting revenue by activity under “Mobile Services,” “Mobile Equipment,” “Fixed,” “Wholesale,” “Media” and “Other.” For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue derived from operational activities was presented under “B2C”, “B2B”, “Wholesale” and “Media”. For comparative purposes, we have revised the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2017. _Mobile Services: Revenues from subscriptions for basic cable services, digital television pay, Internet and_ telephony (fixed and mobile) are recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period; revenues from telephone calls are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered. Revenue from mobile telephony services primarily consists of (i) recurring subscription revenue for our post-paid mobile services (which are recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period), (ii) revenue from purchases of our pre-paid mobile services (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered), (iii) variable usage fees for mobile telephony calls (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered), (iv) revenue from the sale of handsets (which are recognized on the date of transfer of ownership) and (v) interconnection revenue received for calls that terminate on our mobile network. _Mobile Equipment: The Group recognizes revenues when a customer takes possession of the device. This usually_ occurs when the customer signs a new contract. The amount of revenue includes the sale of mobile devices and ancillary equipment for those devices. For mobile devices sold separately, customers pay in full at the point of sale or in several installments (credit agreement). For mobile devices sold in bundled packages, customer usually pay monthly in equal installments over the contractual period. _Fixed: Revenue from fixed-based services consists of revenue from pay television services, including related_ services such as Video on Demand (“VoD”), broadband internet services, fixed-line telephony services and ISP services to our customers. This primarily includes (i) recurring subscription revenue for pay television services, broadband internet and fixed-line telephony (which are recognized in revenue on a straight-line basis over the subscription period), (ii) variable usage fees from VoD and fixed-line telephony calls (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered), (iii) installation fees (which are recognized in revenue when the service is rendered if consideration received is lower than the direct costs to acquire the contractual relationship) and (iv) interconnection revenue received for calls that terminate on our cable network. _Wholesale: Revenue from wholesale services primarily consists of revenues derived from renting our network_ infrastructure services, including IRUs and bandwidth capacity on its network, to other telecommunications operators, including MVNOs as well as related maintenance services. Revenue from B2B services is the same as the above fixed and mobile services, but for the business sector. _Media: Revenues from the media segment includes mainly advertising and subscription revenues derived from_ news, radio and printed press businesses. _Other: Revenue from our other services primarily consists of revenue from other businesses, such as (i) datacenter_ activities, (ii) content production and distribution, (iii) advertising, (iv) customer services, (v) technical services and (vi) other activities that are not related to our core fixed or mobile businesses. _Intersegment Eliminations: Intersegment costs, which primarily relate to services rendered by certain centralized_ Group functions (such content production and customer service) to the operational segments of the Group, are eliminated in consolidation. _Impact of IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)_ In May 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued IFRS 15, which establishes a single comprehensive five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 superseded all current revenue recognition guidance when it became effective for annual periods on January 1, 2018. The Group is required to retrospectively apply IFRS 15 to all contracts that are not complete on the date of initial ----- application and has the option to either (i) restate each prior period and recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the beginning of the earliest period presented or (ii) retain prior period figures as reported under the previous standards and recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity as at the date of initial application. The Group has decided to adopt IFRS 15 based on the full retrospective approach. As a result, the 2018 Financial Statements and the restated comparative period for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the 2018 Financial Statements give effect to the application of IFRS 15 for such periods. The most significant effects of IFRS 15 on the Group’s reporting on the basis of the operating activity of “Mobile Services,” “Mobile Equipment,” “Fixed,” “Wholesale,” “Media” and “Other” are outlined below. _Mobile Services and Mobile Equipment: The most significant impact in the Group’s mobile activities (B2C and_ B2B transactions) as some arrangements include multiple elements that are bundled, such as a discounted handset sale coupled with a communication service component. In applying IFRS 15, the Group has identified such bundled items as separate performance obligations. Total revenue has been allocated to both elements based on their standalone selling price, leading to more revenue being allocated to the handset up-front, even though total revenue would not change in most cases over the life of the contract. Other IFRS 15 impacts include (i) the capitalization of commissions which is broader than the current capitalization model, along with depreciation patterns which require estimates relating to contract duration in some instances and (ii) the impact of early termination and early renewals as well as contract modifications. Further, B2B transactions have been affected by variable considerations such as bonuses and, in some instances, the identification of options for additional handsets at discounted prices. _Fixed: In most cases, fixed services and equipment are not be considered as distinct performance obligations._ Additional services are examined separately. Connection fees, related costs and the capitalization of commissions are also affected, including the determination of the depreciation period for capitalized assets based on the length of contractual periods and any additional periods related to anticipated contracts that the Group can specifically identify. _Wholesale: No major impact has been identified except for the effect of any constraints on variable consideration. Media and Other: No major impact has been identified so far on the Group’s other revenue streams, such as_ content and media.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The transaction closed on March 27, 2019, upon which €522 million total assets and 1.1 million total homes passed were transferred to SFR FTTH. The final proceeds amounted to €1.7 billion, based on an equity value at closing of €3.4 billion. The total capital gain recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019, was €2,796 million. This partnership creates a leading FTTH infrastructure wholesaler in France. Following the closing of the transaction, the Issuer lost exclusive control over SFR FTTH as the Issuer and the JV Consortium have joint control over the new entity. Furthermore, SFR FTTH is accounted for under the equity method in the scope of IFRS 11 (Joint _arrangements). Issuance of new debt instruments_ On September 27, 2019, Altice France issued new debt instruments for an aggregate euro equivalent amount of €2,540 million.

An aggregate of €500 million and $560 million were redeemed. The Issuer paid a call premium of €30 million as part of the redemption. The redemptions were treated as partial extinguishments of the debt instruments and per IFRS 9, unamortised transaction costs were recycled through the consolidated statement of income to the extent of the nominal repaid.

There have also been extraordinary and wide-ranging actions taken by national, regional and local governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus. In response, we have ----- complied with the guidelines provided by the French government and taken measures in order to ensure the health and safety of, and minimize the impact of the pandemic on, our employees, customers, business and operations. In addition, as part of economic measures intended to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses, the French government announced a series of measures, certain of which we were entitled to benefit from, including a partial unemployment benefit for employee salaries. We decided to apply for such government benefit with respect to around 4,600 employees whose jobs were directly impacted by the mandatory lockdown imposed by the French government. Under such measure, the French government paid the relevant employees the equivalent of 84% of their fixed and variable pay per month for the period between March 2020 and May 2020 and the Group paid the remaining 16%. There were no restrictions on the Group’s business associated with subscribing to such measure. We have continued to provide our telecommunications services to our customers during this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a limited impact on the financial results of the Group as of and for the six months ended June 30, 2020 demonstrating a resilient telecom business, although we have been adversely impacted by a decline in handsets sales due to store closures, a decrease in roaming revenue, some delays in the construction of FTTH homes passed in France and a decline in advertising revenue. We expect that our future results may be impacted, including if residential or business customers discontinue their service or are unable to pay for our products and services, if roaming revenue continues to decline due to reduced international travel or if advertising revenue continues to decline. Additionally, in order to prioritize the demands of the business, we may continue to delay certain capital investments. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and duration of business and economic impacts relating to COVID-19, including the effort to contain and combat the spread of the virus, and business impacts of government actions, we currently cannot reasonably estimate the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The Group has taken into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its accounting estimates, notably those related to the valuation of non-current and current assets (including goodwill). The carrying value of the non-current and current assets has not been adjusted as of June 30, 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information above and available liquidity and cash requirements, the Group considers that the assessment of the going concern assumption for the Group is not impacted. _Financing flows with Altice Group entities_ For the six months ended June 30, 2020: - The Group increased its receivable position with Altice Group Luxembourg S.A. for an additional amount of €175 million; - The Group repaid a portion of an existing loan owed to Altice Lux for an aggregate amount of €180 million; and - The Group provided a short term loan to its direct shareholder Altice France Holding for an aggregate amount of €118 million. _Transfer of Libération by the Issuer to a non-profit organization_ On May 14, 2020, the Issuer announced that it would transfer _Libération, the daily newspaper, to_ _Presse _Indépendante SAS, a management and holding company to be owned by a non-profit organization_ _Fonds de Dotation pour une Presse Indépendante (“FDPI”). Although FDPI will not manage Presse Indépendante SAS nor Libération, it would be entitled to future profits that would in turn be redistributed to other non-profit organizations._ In connection with this transfer, the Issuer will make an initial donation to FDPI, which will be invested by FDPI into _Presse Indépendante SAS, which in turn will acquire the shares in_ _Libération and consequently repay _Libération’s debts and finance its future operations. This will help ensure the editorial, economic and financial_ independence of Libération in the long term. The transfer is expected to be completed in September 2020. Following the closing of the transaction, the Group will no longer exercise control over Libération and therefore the assets and associated liabilities of Libération were classified as held for sale as per the provisions of IFRS 5 (Non-currents assets held for sale and discontinued ----- _operations) in the “Consolidated Statement of Financial Position” as of June 30, 2020. The estimated capital loss_ has been recorded in the statement of income for the six months ended June 30, 2020 for €32 million in the caption “other expenses and income”. _Restructuring plan at NextRadioTV_ On May 19, 2020, NextRadioTV announced a restructuring plan to take into account the changing environment for the media industry in France and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the advertising market. This plan aims at reducing the employee workforce by limiting the use of part time workers, freelancers and consultants. Since as of June 30, 2020, the details had not been shared with the workers’ council and the conditions of the departure plan were not yet final, management considers that the conditions for recording a provision are not met as per IAS 37 (Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets) as of June 30, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Group added 43,000 new B2C fixed customers (compared to 60,000 net-adds in 2019), with 127,000 fiber net adds in 2019 as compared to 157,000 fiber net adds in 2020. B2C fixed revenue in 2020 was also impacted by the loss of favourable VAT treatment on telecom/press bundles (ended in February 2019). Residential fixed sales were impacted in part by the COVID-19 pandemic mainly as a result of the closure of our shops in the second half of March 2020 till mid May 2020. Revenues for the Group’s residential mobile services grew to €1,767 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to €1,748 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This trend was driven primarily by the impact of consecutive positive net-adds in the residential mobile segment since the first quarter of 2018 and a relative stabilisation of market pricing due to less intensive promotional activities from competitors. For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Group continued its positive net-adds trend, adding 177,000 new residential mobile post-paid customers (compared to net adds of 221,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2019). This is a result of investments made in improving network quality and successful churn reduction measures implemented by the Group since the end of 2017. Residential mobile sales were impacted in part by the COVID-19 pandemic mainly as a result of the closure of our shops in the second half of March 2020 till mid May 2020.

Business services revenue was impacted by an increase in revenues derived from the construction business with SFR FTTH for the six months ended June 30, 2020. The FTTH construction business was included for three months only in the six months ended June 30, 2019, compared to six months for the period ended June 30, 2020. Equipment revenues decreased by 15.2% from €415 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019 to €352 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, mainly as a result of the closure of shops due to the mandatory lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic (from mid-March to mid-May), which erased the gains seen in equipment sales in the first quarter of 2020. Revenues from the Group’s media activities totalled €158 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020, a 32.3% decrease as compared to €233 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019.

In accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), assets intended for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale were placed on specific line items in the statement of financial position for the amounts of €522 million as of December 31, 2018; since the impact on the statement of income and the statement of cash flows is not substantial, these statements were not restated.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

This decrease was mainly due to customer losses experienced in previous quarters (consecutive losses throughout 2017), the loss of favourable VAT treatment on audiobook bundling (in 2019) and partly impacted by more intense market competition following SFR’s successful churn reduction and more proactive retention activity. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group added 137,000 new B2C fixed customers (compared to 187,000 net-adds in 2018), with 262,000 fiber net adds in 2019 as compared to 284,000 fiber net adds in 2018. B2C fixed revenue was also impacted by the loss of favourable VAT treatment on telecom/press bundles (ended in February 2018). Revenues for the Group’s residential mobile services grew to €3,515 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €3,472 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This trend was driven primarily by the impact of consecutive positive net-adds in the residential mobile segment for the past six quarters and a relative stabilisation of market pricing due to less intensive promotional activities from competitors. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Group continued its positive net adds trend, adding 652,000 new B2C mobile post-paid customer (compared to net adds of 1,049,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018), as a result of an improved customer experience and anti-churn measures implemented at the end of 2017. Revenues from our business services segment grew by 20.3% to reach €3,377 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to €2,808 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This revenue growth was mainly due to the inclusion of revenues for the full nine months from our technical services, customer services and overseas territories businesses (€195 million), which were not included in the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. The business services revenue was also impacted by revenues derived from the construction business with SFR FTTH for the year ended December 31, 2019. Mobile equipment revenues grew by 3.6% from €889 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to €923 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, mainly driven by the uptake of higher end smartphones by customers in 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Revenues from the Group’s media activities totalled €453 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a 2.2% decrease as compared to €463 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This trend was driven by a decline in our printed press business, which was partially offset by continued growth of our radio/television business, which grew by 11.4% (from €348 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to € 387 million for the year ended December 31, 2019).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.65,"Agreement”). Under the terms of the Faber Agreement, SFR and Bouygues Telecom committed to jointly invest",17.65.1,,"in the rollout of a horizontal fiber optic network in a defined number of towns and districts located in high density areas. Although the Group already had very high speed capabilities through its FTTB cable network, the French Competition Authority considered that the takeover of SFR by the Group may cast doubt over SFR’s incentive to honor its commitments to its joint investors, and in particular to Bouygues Telecom under the Faber Agreement. To address this potential risk, the French Competition Authority requested that commitments be made to guarantee that the new group would supply the buildings requested by Bouygues Telecom under the Faber Agreement. These commitments covered three main points: 1. The obligation to provide distribution services for all termination points delivered as of October 30, 2014 within two years; ----- 2. The drafting of a rider to the Faber Agreement allowing Bouygues Telecom to order a list of buildings of its choice for the distribution to termination points delivered after October 30, 2014 within three months (excluding performance constraints); and 3. The provision of maintenance for the FTTH infrastructure in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner using certain quality indicators. By Decision No. 15 SO 14, dated October 5, 2015, the French Competition Authority opened an inquiry to determine whether the Altice Europe Group and the Group are complying with these commitments. By Decision No. 17 D04, dated March 8, 2017, the French Competition Authority decided to levy a financial sanction of €40 million against the Altice Europe Group and the Group and imposed periodic penalty payments for not having respected the commitments set out in the Faber Agreement. This amount was recognized in the Group’s financial statements as of March 31, 2017 and was paid over the second quarter of 2017. A summary was lodged on April 13, 2017 before the French Supreme Court (Conseil d’état). The judge in chambers of the Council of State stated that there was no matter to be referred. On September 28, 2017, the French Supreme Court rejected the request of the Altice Europe Group and the Group to cancel the French Competition Authority’s decision. _Decision of the Administrative Court regarding the penalty to pay for €97 million by Sequalum to the department of Hauts-de-Seine_ Pursuant to two decisions rendered on March 16, 2017, the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise rejected the actions brought by Sequalum, a subsidiary of the Group, regarding two enforcement measures issued by the department of Hauts-de-Seine in respect of penalties in the amounts of €52 million and €45 million. Sequalum appealed these decisions before the Administrative Court of Versailles. Following the dismissal by the Administrative Court of Versailles, the penalties were paid to the “Tresor Public” in July 2017. _Restructuring_ On August 4, 2016, the Group’s management and some representative unions of the Group’s telecom division signed an agreement to allow the Group to adapt more quickly to the demands of the telecom market by building a more competitive and efficient organization. This agreement reaffirmed the commitments made at the time of the SFR Acquisition to maintain jobs until July 1, 2017 and defined the internal assistance guarantees and the conditions for voluntary departures implemented in the second half of 2016. This agreement set out three steps: 1. the reorganization of retail stores, presented to the staff representatives on September 2016, resulting in a voluntary departure plan as of the fourth quarter of 2016 and accompanied by a change in channel distribution and the closing of stores; 2. the preparation of a new voluntary departure plan to be launched in July 2017, preceded by a possibility for employees who wanted to benefit from this plan to request suspension of their employment contract in the fourth quarter of 2016 in order to pursue their professional plans outside of the Group; and 3. a period between July 2017 and June 2019 during which employees could also benefit from a voluntary departure plan under conditions to be defined. The Group made a commitment that its telecoms division would have no fewer than 10,000 employees during this period. The first phase of this agreement, namely the reorganization of retail stores, ended in March 2017 with the validation of approximately 800 employee departures. By December 2017, a residual amount of €8 million was recognized for restructuring of retail stores in provisions. The amount paid as of December, 31, 2017 was €87 million and the amount recorded in payables was €21 million at the end of December 31, 2017. Furthermore, the GPEC Group Agreement was signed on February 1, 2017 by a majority of the representative unions of the Group’s telecoms division. It specified the external mobility scheme offered to the employees for the period prior to September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, 1,360 employees benefited from GPEC’s “Mobilité Volontaire Sécurisée” plan, and benefited in priority from the voluntary departure plan. ----- Finally, the “Livre 2”, a legally binding document that described the target organization of the Group’s telecoms division was delivered to the representative unions on April 3, 2017. The validation commissions began in July. The plan ended in November 2017 (except for SRR) with the validation of approximately 3,200 employee departures. We recognized restructuring costs of €700 million relating to this plan in the year ended December 31. 2017. _Refinancing of loans_ On April 18, 2017, the Group raised new term loans in order to refinance a portion of its existing term loans. The Group refinanced two existing tranches, term loan B7 (denominated in US Dollars) and term loan B9 (denominated in euros) by issuing two new tranches, term loan B11 (denominated in US Dollars) and term loan B11 (SG) (denominated in euros). At the time of the refinancing, the amount outstanding under term loan B7 was US$1,414 million and the amount outstanding under term loan B9 was €296 million. The amounts outstanding under the new term loans amounted to $1,420 million and €300 million. Ypso France S.A.S., as borrower under certain of the existing term loans, refinanced existing term loan B7 (denominated in Euros) with a new term loan B11 (YF) (denominated in euros). At the time of the refinancing, the amount outstanding under existing term loan B7 was €843 million. The amount outstanding under the new term loan B11 amounted to €845 million. These refinancings allowed the Group to extend the maturities of certain existing term loans. These refinancings also allowed the Group to reduce the cost of certain existing term loans. From an accounting standpoint, these operations were treated as a non-substantial modification of the existing debt and therefore the issuance costs capitalized in previous periods were rolled over onto the new debt as per IAS 39. Following these improvements in the terms of the Group’s existing debt, the average debt maturity was extended from 7.0 to 7.3 years and the weighted average cost of debt decreased from 5.2% to 4.9%. As there was no significant change in the outstanding amounts due under the existing debt denominated in US Dollars before and after the refinancing, there have been no changes to the Group’s hedging instruments. On October 9, 2017, the Group successfully priced €3 billion (equivalent) of new 8.25-year term loans. Proceeds were used to refinance the Group’s €697 million and $2 billion term loans due 2025, and to repay €600 million of commercial paper. These refinancings allowed the Group to extend the maturities of certain existing term loans. The average maturity of the Group’s capital structure was extended from 6.8 to 7.2 years and the weighted average cost of debt decreased to 4.7%. This refinancing was treated as an extinguishment of financial instruments and issuance costs capitalized in prior periods were expensed via the consolidated statement of income. See Note 11 to the English language translation of the Group’s audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. _Closing of the sale of the B2B Press activity_ On April 28, 2017, the Group completed the sale of the companies from Newsco’s B2B activities and L’Etudiant to the holding company Coalition Media Group. The Group subsequently acquired a 25% interest in this holding. As part of the transaction, the vendor loan contracted during the acquisition of the AMGF Group for €100 million was fully reimbursed. The Group recorded a €28 million capital gain. In accordance with IFRS 5 (Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations), assets intended for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale were placed on specific line items in the statement of financial position as of December 31, 2016 for the amounts of €59 million and €46 million respectively; given that the impact on the statement of financial performance and the statement of cash flows is not substantial, these statements were not restated as of December 31, 2016. _Altice Europe rebranding_ During the second quarter of 2017, Altice Europe announced its new branding strategy which was expected to represent the transformation of the Altice Europe Group from a holding company with a collection of different assets and brands around the world to the establishment of one unified group with one single brand, Altice. The Altice name, brand and new logo was expected to replace the current brands within Altice Europe’s subsidiaries. ----- It was expected that the Group’s brand would have completed the transition process by the end of the second quarter of 2018. B2B brands were expected to become Altice Business. Some telecom brands (Red, Next TV), media brands (i24News, BFMTV, RMC Sport) and press brands (Libération, L’Express) were expected to be maintained. The board meeting held on May 22, 2017 approved the new brand proposed by Altice Europe. Considering the SFR brand’s residual useful life, the Group applied an accelerated amortization on the SFR brand in its half year financial statements. However, in December 2017, Altice Europe’s board of directors made a decision to postpone the adoption of the global brand, increasing the useful life of the local trade name intangible asset to 5 years, which will reduce the future annual amortization expense related to the local brand trade name. The amortization expense amounts €453 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to €70 million in the absence of accelerated amortization. _Repricing of certain derivative instruments_ In July 2017, the Group monetized a part of the latent gains in certain derivative financial instruments through the repricing and extension of the maturity of these financial instruments. An aggregate amount of US$2,150.5 million, initially exchanged at a rate of 1.3827 (EUR/US Dollar), was repriced to an average rate of 1.223 (EUR/US Dollar), with an extension of maturity from 2022 to 2025. As a result of the repricing, the Group recognized a financial gain of €203 million against a cash payment for the same amount.

The 2018 Financial Statements reflect the change in accounting standard. The consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the 2018 Financial Statements has been restated for the impacts of IFRS 15. See notes 1.2, 2.3 and 38 to the 2018 Financial Statements for more information. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the impacts of IFRS 15 on the Group’s revenues were €(95) million. Mobile services:_ Revenues for the Group’s mobile services decreased from €4,158 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €3,907 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 6.0% decrease. This decrease was driven primarily by continued pricing pressure on mobile offers for our B2C base, impacts of customer loss from previous quarters in 2017, and the repricing of the B2B mobile base in Q2 2017 having a full year impact in 2018. Residential mobile revenue was also impacted by the loss of favorable VAT treatment on telecom/press bundles ----- (ended in February 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Group added approximately 1,012,000 new mobile B2C customers (compared to approximately 199,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017), as a result of an improved customer experience and anti-churn measures implemented in the end of 2017. B2B mobile netadds remained negative during the period ((54,000) for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to (76,000) for the year ended December 31, 2017), following measures taken from the first half of 2017 onwards to correct back book price reductions. Mobile equipment:_ Mobile equipment revenues remained flat at €773 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the full year ended December 31, 2017. Fixed:_ The Group’s fixed activity revenues decreased by 7.1% from €4,084 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to €3,793 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was mainly due to customer losses experienced in previous quarters in 2017 and partly impacted by more intense market competition following SFR’s successful churn reduction and more proactive retention activity. B2C fixed revenue was also impacted by the loss of favorable VAT treatment on telecom/press bundles (ended in February 2018). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Group added approximately 186,000 new B2C fixed customers (compared to 171,000 losses in the year ended December 31, 2017), with 284,000 fiber net adds (offset by 116,000 losses in ADSL customers). Wholesale:_ Wholesale revenues decreased by 7.7% to €1,189 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from €1,289 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from MVNO operators and a decline in the international wholesale voice business. Media:_ Revenues from the Group’s media activities totaled €463 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, a 10.3% decrease as compared to €516 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was driven by the sale of certain press businesses in the second half of 2017, thus impacting 2018 revenues. The news and television part of our media businesses grew by 16.9% to reach €347 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to €297 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

As of June 30, 2020, our revolving credit facility was undrawn. We expect to use these sources of liquidity to fund operating expenses, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other liquidity requirements that may arise from time to time. The availability of borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities is conditioned upon compliance with specified leverage ratios. Our ability to generate cash from our operations will depend on our future operating performance, which is in turn dependent, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, the cash provided from the operations of our operating subsidiaries and any available borrowings under the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, and debt service requirements during the next 12 months, although no assurance can be given that this will be the case. However, as our debt matures in later years, we anticipate that we will seek to refinance or otherwise extend our debt maturities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to complete such refinancings or otherwise extend our debt maturities. In this regard, it is not possible to predict how economic conditions, sovereign debt concerns and/or any adverse regulatory developments could impact the credit markets we access and accordingly, our future liquidity and financial position. In addition, sustained or increased competition, particularly in combination with adverse economic or regulatory developments, could have an unfavourable impact on our cash flows and liquidity. The debt issued by the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries is subject to incurrence based covenants, which do not require ongoing compliance with financial ratios, but place certain limitations on the relevant restricted group’s ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional debt (including to finance new acquisitions), create liens, pay dividends and other distributions to shareholders or prepay subordinated indebtedness, make investments, sell assets, engage in affiliate transactions or engage in mergers or consolidations. These covenants are subject to several important exceptions and qualifications. To be able to incur additional debt under an applicable debt instrument, the relevant restricted group must either meet the ratio test described below (on a pro forma basis for any contemplated transaction giving rise to the debt incurrence) or have available capacity under the general debt basket described below or meet certain other exceptions to the limitation on indebtedness covenant in such debt instrument. ----- The Group’s senior debt is subject to an incurrence test of 4.0:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to net debt), while the Group’s senior secured debt is subject to an incurrence test of 3.25:1 (Adjusted EBITDA to net senior secured debt). The Group or its relevant subsidiaries are allowed to fully consolidate the EBITDA from any subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest and that are contained in the restricted group as defined in the relevant debt instruments. The Group has access to a revolving credit facilities, which are subject to maintenance covenants in addition to the incurrence based covenants described above. The Issuer is a holding company with no direct source of operating income. Therefore, the Issuer will be dependent on dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to meet its liquidity requirements .

The negative working capital position is structural and follows industry norms. Customers generally pay subscription revenues early or mid-month, with short days of sales outstanding, and suppliers are paid in the beginning of the following month, thus generating a negative working capital.

This was partially offset by higher income tax paid for the six months ended June 30, 2020 (€196 million) compared to €101 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. ----- _Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities_ For the six months ended June 30, 2020, the Group recorded a net cash outflow in investing activities in an amount of €1,122 million, compared to net cash provided by investing activities of €340 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. The difference can mainly be attributed to the closing of the SFR FTTH divestment for which the Group received net cash proceeds of €1,479 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. Capital expenditure amounted to €1,098 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to €1,093 million for the six months ended June 30, 2019. _Net cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities_ For the six months ended June 30, 2020, net cash used in financing activities amounted to €957 million, compared to €2,772 million used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2019. This difference was mainly due to: (i) higher net proceeds from debt refinancing activity and variations in the drawing of the revolving credit facility (€500 million new debt issuance and €100 million net redemption of the revolving credit facilities in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to €75 million net revolving credit facilities drawdown in the six months ended June 30, 2019), (ii) lower interest paid on our debt instruments (€389 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared to €433 million in six months ended June 30, 2019), offset by (iii) a decrease in the aggregate amount of dividends and loan repayments made to Altice Lux (€355 million in the six months ended June 30, 2020 compared €820 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019) and (iv) the partial redemption of the 2024 Notes for an aggregate amount of €995 million in the six months ended June 30, 2019, which did not occur in the six months ended June 30, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

This trend was the result of (i) higher operating profit recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019 which was offset by a working capital unwinding effect in 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 (€(532) million compared to €(245) million) and (ii) the first time implementation of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019.

This decrease was mainly due to the payment of indemnities related to the voluntary departure plan launched in 2017 (€328 million in 2018, compared to an accrual in 2017).

The increase in the year ended December 31, 2018 can mainly be attributed to the acquisitions of ATS, ACS and FOT in 2018, amounting to a cash payment of €818 million in 2018. _Net cash flow provided by (used in) financing activities_ For the full year ended December 31, 2018, the Group generated net cash from financing activities for an amount of €1,142 million, compared a net outflow of cash from financing activities of €117 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial valuations.

See notes 24 and 30 to the 2019 Financial Statements for more details. _Credit Risk_ The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk. Credit risk may arise from the exposures of commitments under a number of financial instruments with one counterparty or as the result of commitments with a number of groups of debtors with similar economic characteristics, whose ability to meet their commitments could be similarly affected by economic or other changes. The Group’s income mainly derives from customers in France. The majority of our B2C clients are on direct debit, thus reducing credit and recovery risk from our biggest operating segment. The Group regularly monitors its customers’ debts and provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the consolidated financial statements, which provide a fair value of the loss that is inherent to debts whose collection lies in doubt. _Liquidity Risk_ Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Managers, which manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecasted and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. The Group has a strong track record of driving operating free cash flow generation and specializes in turning around struggling businesses and improving the cash generation of existing businesses. As all external debt is issued and managed centrally, the executive directors of the Group have a significant amount of control and visibility over the payments required to satisfy obligations under the different external debts. ----- Additionally, as of June 30, 2020, the Group has access to revolving credit facilities of up to €1,415 million (which remained undrawn as of June 30, 2020) to cover any liquidity needs not met by operating cash flow generation. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Sources of Liquidity”. _Interest Rate and Related Risk_ For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows. Accordingly, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant effect on the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt at maturity. On a consolidated basis, taking into account our swap portfolio, our primary fixed rate debt obligations were in an amount equivalent to €10,421 million, while our primary floating rate debt obligations were equivalent to €7,248 million. _Foreign Currency Risk_ As part of its financial risk management strategy, the Group has entered into certain hedging operations. These are split mainly into either fixed to fixed or floating to floating cross-currency and interest rate swaps that cover against foreign currency and interest rate risk, foreign exchange forwards that cover against foreign exchange risk only, or interest rate swaps covering interest rate risk only.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.104,"Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates",17.104.1,,"For details regarding the Group’s critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates, see note 2 to the 2019 Financial Statements . For details regarding the Group’s adoption of IFRS 16 and its impact on its financial statements, see note 1.2 to the 2019 Financial Statements. IFRS 16 supersedes IAS: 17 (Leases), IFRIC 4 (Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease), SIC-15: (Operating Leases-Incentives) and SIC-27: (Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form _of a Lease). The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of_ leases and requires lessees to account for most leases under a single on-balance sheet model. The change of definition of a lease mainly relates to the conception of control. IFRS 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17. Therefore, IFRS 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor. The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. Therefore, 2018 financial statements were not restated under the new standard. The Group has lease contracts related to mobile sites (land, space in cell towers or rooftop, agreement with towers company), network infrastructure (including local loop unbundling), buildings used for administrative or technical purposes and other assets (vehicles). Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease was classified as a finance lease if it transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the Group; otherwise it was classified as an operating lease. Finance leases were capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between interest (recognized as finance costs) and reduction of the lease liability. In an operating lease, the leased property was not capitalised and the lease payments were recognized as rent expense in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any prepaid rent and accrued rent were recognized under “Trade and other receivables” and “Trade and other payables”, respectively. ----- Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases that it is the lessee. The Group recognized lease liabilities to make lease payments and right of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The standard provides specific transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group: - Right of use assets are reported separately in the statement of financial position. - The recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 are also applied to short term leases and leases of low-value assets. - A distinction is made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components except for agreements for which the separation is impracticable (master service agreements with towers company). - Application of the portfolio approach for the recognition and measurements of certain asset categories with similar characteristics (same residual value, same economic environment), mainly for local loop unbundling. - Application of the standard to contracts that were previously identified as finance leases under IAS 17/IFRIC 4 at the transition date (carry forward of existing finance lease liabilities). - Calculate outstanding liability for existing operating leases using the incremental borrowing rate at date of transition. - IFRS 16 is not applied to leases for intangible assets. - The Group chooses to apply the relief option, which allows it to adjust the right of use asset by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognised in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application. Based on the aforementioned, as at January 1, 2019: - Right of use assets of €3,233 million were recognised and presented separately in the statement of financial position. This includes the lease assets recognised previously under finance leases of €121 million that were reclassified from “Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets”. - Additional lease liabilities of €3,214 million (current and non-current) were recognised (including the reclassification of finance lease liabilities already recorded as of December 31, 2018 of €79 million). - Trade and other receivables of €39 million and trade and other payables of €60 million related to previous operating leases were derecognised. - Deferred tax liabilities increased by €19 million because of the deferred tax impact of the changes in assets and liabilities. - Provision for onerous contract (current and non-current) was reclassified in reduction on right of use assets for €60 million. - The net effect of these adjustments had been adjusted to equity for €40 million. In addition, the Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group. In June 2019, the IFRIC issued a tentative agenda decision related to subsurface rights concluding that when a contract between a land owner and another party gives the other party the right to place an oil pipeline in a specified underground space, with the land owner retaining the right to use the surface area of the land above the pipeline, that contract contains a lease. ----- The Group has completed its assessment and has concluded that in its contracts, the suppliers have a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use and therefore, the contracts do not constitute a lease. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. See “Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” for a discussion of important factors to be evaluated in connection with an investment in the Notes. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires or otherwise specifies, the term “Group”, “we”, “us” and “our” refers to the Altice France and its subsidiaries. The Group applies International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed in the European Union. Adjusted EBITDA and Capital Expenditures (accrued), and measures derived therefrom, are not defined in IFRS, they are “non-IFRS measures”. Management believes these meausres are useful to readers of the Group’s financial statements as it provides a measure of operating results excluding certain items that we believe are either outside of our recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in our operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. We use the non-IFRS measures internally to manage and assess the results of our operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also the de facto metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in our industry, and thus are a basis for comparability between us and our peers. However, Adjusted EBITDA, as used herein, is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, net income or loss, operating income, cash flow or other combined income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The Open Internet Access Regulation set new limits for retail roaming rates in Europe billed by mobile operators applicable between July 1, 2014, and April 29, 2016, and after April 29, 2016. The Roaming Regulation also abolished roaming charges as from June 15, 2017. On November 29, 2019, the Commission published a report assessing the European roaming market and suggested the extension of the retail and wholesale roaming rules beyond June 20, 2022. In this context, the Commission also plans to further examine the adequacy of the wholesale roaming price caps. On June 11, 2020, the BEREC published its Guidelines on the Implementation of the Open Internet Access Regulation. These guidelines include the obligations for regulatory authorities to closely monitor and ensure compliance with the rules to safeguard equal and non-discriminatory treatment of traffic in the provision of internet access services and related end-users rights. The Open Internet Access Regulation introduced measures on net neutrality Article 3 of the Open Internet Access Regulation established the following net neutrality principles: - The right of end-users to access and distribute content, use and provide applications and services, and use terminal equipment of their choice, irrespective of location, origin or destination of the information, content, application or service, via their internet access service; and - Internet access service providers are to treat all traffic equally, without discrimination, restriction or interference. These two principles are subject to the following exceptions: - Compliance with court orders; - Protecting the integrity or security of the network; and - Prevention of network congestion occurring temporarily and under exceptional circumstances. Moreover, operators are subject to stronger transparency obligations. They must in particular provide more information in customers’ contracts (such as impact of traffic management techniques used by ISPs, the concrete impact of caps or allowances, information on connection speed, etc.). The principle of net neutrality is also affirmed in the law no. 2016-1321 of October 7, 2016 for a digital Republic, which introduced Articles L. 32-1 et seq. in the Postal and Electronic Communications Code (Code des Postes et _des Communications Electroniques, “CPCE”). The Articles provide that operators may not discriminate in_ providing access to the network on the basis of services and may appoint the Postal and Electronic Communications Regulator (Autorité de Régulation des Communications Electroniques et des Postes, “ARCEP”) to ensure that this principle is observed. ----- The European Commission launched a review of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications in 2016 through a draft directive aiming at establishing a European Electronic Communications Code (the “EECC”) submitted to the Council and to the Parliament on September 14, 2016. The BEREC published its opinion on the EECC draft directive on December 13, 2016 focusing on (i) the scope of the framework, (ii) the access regulation and (iii) the institutional set-up. The EECC draft directive is still in the process of being discussed and examined by the Parliament and the Council. On December 11, 2018, the Directive (EU) 2018/1972 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the EECC was adopted. It came into force on December 20, 2018 and must be transposed by Member States by December 21, 2020. The EECC brings together the rules on electronic communications networks and services and aligns them with the latest technological developments. The EECC regulates (1) electronic communications networks and services (“ECN” and “ECS”), (2) associated facilities and services, (3) the authorisation of networks and services, (4) radio spectrum use and numbering resources, (5) access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities and (6) the protection of end-users.

In addition to the many consumer protection rules that are not specific to the electronic communications sector, the «Chatel law» updated the French Consumer Code to protect consumers using mobile and internet technology (Articles L.121-84-1 _et seq.). National Regulatory Authorities (“NRAs”) are responsible for effective implementation and supervision of the Framework. On November 23, 2018, a law (no. 2018-1021) was enacted that considerably modified the French legislative framework for electronic communications, in particular by strengthening the penalties that operators face for noncompliance with their deployment obligations (under Article L36-11 of the CPCE) and requiring operators to grant reasonable access to their network infrastructure. It must be underlined that France has not yet enacted the EECC into domestic law but a public consultation on the transposition into national law of the EECC’s provisions was initiated on December 2019 by the French Government.

ARCEP is an independent administrative authority in charge of regulating the electronic communications sector, managing administrative procedures, defining access, interconnection and roaming conditions, calculating costs and contributions to the universal service and rate regulation, and assigning rights for the use of frequencies. To exercise its prerogatives, ARCEP has a variety of powers, in particular to make regulations, control, settle disputes, advise and sanction. ARCEP’s decisions may relate to asymmetric regulation (which apply to operators occupying a dominant position on the market) or symmetric regulation (which apply to all operators). Certain symmetric regulatory decisions need to be approved by the Ministry for Electronic Communication. The law n° 2015-99 on growth, business and equal economic opportunities, of August 6, 2015 (“Macron Law”), endowed ARCEP with new powers and new missions, including the ability to require operators to amend their mobile network sharing agreements when necessary to achieve regulatory objectives. The ARCEP is required to publish a report evaluating investments by each mobile operators in the deployment of new infrastructure. On that occasion, the Authority will verify the respect of the radio network sharing agreement. _Competition Authority_ The French Competition Authority is an independent administrative authority in charge of monitoring competition under Article L. 461-1 of the French Commercial Code. It is responsible for identifying anti-competitive practices in the market, merger controls and provision of advisory opinions. In its role of identifying anti-competitive practices, in accordance with Articles L. 464-1 and 2 of the French Commercial Code, the Competition Authority can: (i) impose fines; (ii) require businesses to cease such practices; (iii) accept commitments with regard to elimination of anti-competitive practices and (iv) impose certain injunctions in the event of urgency. Under Article L. 464-8 of the French Commercial code, an appeal can be lodged against these decisions (in itself, not suspensive) before the Paris Court of Appeal, within one month. An appeal can be lodged against the ruling of the Court of Appeal of Paris in front of the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court) within one month. ----- In its merger control role, in accordance with Articles L. 430-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the Competition Authority must give _ex ante authorization to mergers between certain large businesses. It may: (i) authorize the merger; (ii) prohibit a merger; or (iii) subject authorization of a merger to certain conditions. Under Article R. 311-1 of the Code of Administrative Justice, the parties and third parties concerned can lodge an appeal (in itself, not suspensive) for annulment or reformulation with the Conseil d’État within two months. In its advisory role, in accordance with Articles L. 462-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, the Competition Authority provides opinions on the function of the markets at the request of the government, parliament, courts, legal entities representing public interests or on its own initiative. No appeal can be brought against these opinions. _Conseil Supérieur de l’Audiovisuel_ Created by the law no. 89-25 of January 17, 1989, the French Broadcasting Regulator (Conseil Supérieur de _l’Audiovisuel, “CSA”) seeks to safeguard the freedom of audiovisual communication in France. The law no. 86-_ 1067 of September 30, 1986, which has seen several amendments, gives it powers with respect to the protection of minors, respect for the pluralistic expression of opinions, organization of electoral campaigns on radio and television, rigorous processing of information, allocation of spectrum to operators, respect for human dignity and consumer protection. With regard to spectrum allocation, the CSA is responsible for administration and allocation of frequencies intended for radio and television. It is also responsible for planning “hertzian” spectrum bands to be used by radio stations, issuing licenses to use the frequencies, and planning and allocating broadcasting channels to digital terrestrial television operators. In case of disputes regarding the above, the CSA performs an arbitral role between publishers of services and producers of works or audiovisual programs or their representatives, or the professional organizations representing them. CSA can make recommendations to broadcasters and distributors of audiovisual communication services on compliance with the principles set forth in the law of September 30, 1986 referred to above. It has the powers to impose sanctions in case of non-compliance with the principles by broadcasters or distributors of services. Law no. 2016-1524 of November 14, 2016 aiming at strengthening freedom, independence and pluralism of the media modified the law of September 30, 1986 referred to above in order to regulate the powers of the CSA regarding transfers of television channels. On December 5, 2019, a bill has been introduced before Parliament which aims at merging CSA and HADOPI (which are both independent administrative authorities) into a single one to be called the “Autorité de régulation _de la communication audiovisuelle et numérique”._",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The strategy is founded on three pillars: (i) providing better access for consumers to on-line services across Europe, (ii) creating conditions for development of digital networks and services and (iii) maximizing the growth potential of the European digital economy. Following the adoption of Regulation 2015/2120, on September 11, 2015 the European Commission launched a public consultation of the 2002 Telecoms Package (as amended in 2009). On January 19, 2016, the European Parliament adopted the resolution “Toward a Digital market”. In its resolution, the European Parliament welcomed the European Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy, but also expressed its concern about the divergent national approaches taken so far by EU member states when regulating the internet and the “sharing economy”. The topics addressed in the resolution include the necessity to increase consumer choice and to remove barriers for innovative start-ups. Other topics addressed in the resolution include copyright, regulation of the telecommunications sector, VAT rules, audio-visual media, e-skills, e-government, and employment rights. With regard to regulation of the telecommunications sector, the Resolution also: - emphasizes the key role of private investments in fast and ultra-fast communication networks in driving digital progress that must be supported by a stable EU regulatory framework enabling all players to make investments, including in rural and remote areas; - reminds the member states of their commitment to reach by 2020 full broadband network deployment of minimum speeds of 30 Mbps; - underlines the need to ensure that end-user rights laid down in the telecommunications framework are coherent, proportionate and appropriate; and - a mid-term review of the Digital Single Market strategy has been published by the European Commission on May 10, 2017. Said review emphasises the progress accomplished and identifies three mains areas toward which European Union’s actions are needed: (i) the development of the European Data Economy to its full potential, (ii) Europe’s assets protection through cybersecurity and (iii) the promotion of online platforms as responsible players of a fair internet system. ----- On May 22, 2019, Directive (EU) 2019/770 on contract for the supply of digital content and Directive (EU) 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning contracts for the sale of goods were published on the Official Journal of the European Commission as part of the Digital Single Market Strategy. Both of these Directives strengthen the protection of consumers rights with respect to the purchase of digital content and/or online sales.

Number portability is an obligation of all operators providing their services to end-users in accordance with Article L. 44, D.406-18 and D. 406-19 of the CPCE and extends to both fixed-line and mobile operators. In January 2009, the leading operators, including members the Group, set up a dedicated entity, the Fixed Numbers Portability Association (Association de la Portabilité des Numéros Fixes) to effectively manage information sharing with regard to requests for fixed number portability. ----- ARCEP Decision no. 2013-0830 of June 25, 2013 lays down new obligations for operators that target the enduser market, in particular in terms of information and quality of service, which must be gradually implemented before October 1, 2015. Concerning mobile number portability, the original regulatory mechanism has undergone several changes aimed at establishing maximum durations for switching, enhancing customer experience and ensuring information provisions for subscribers. ARCEP Decision no. 2012-0576 of May 10, 2012 specifies arrangements for the application of mobile number portability. The French Government approved the ARCEP decision dated June 25, 2013, specifying the procedures for portability of fixed-line numbers. The ARCEP decision establishes the following requirements for operators on the consumer market: - portability processing duration is shortened to three working days, provided access is available; - clarification of the rules for compensation in case of delay or mishandling of a number portability request; - harmonized information to subscribers throughout the number portability process; and - from October 2014, the introduction of a quarantine period, which enables a number to be ported up to 40 days after the account is cancelled. On October 1, 2015, an operator identity statement or (“RIO”, relevé d’identité opérateur) for fixed operators, like the RIO that already exists for mobile number portability, was created at ARCEP’s request, which also implements a dedicated tool to make it easier for operators to identify the subscriber and facilitate the process to port one’s number to a new operators. The process has also changed for the business market: - the portability process is shortened to seven working days, provided access is available; - for better information of business customers, fixed operators must make available all the technical and contractual information necessary to switch operators while retaining one’s fixed number; - service is maintained until the actual portability: if the contract expires before portability occurred, the former operator should extend the provision of service on the fixed number until its actual portability; - from October 2014: implementation of the quarantine period; and - starting October, 1 2015: operators can jointly elect to extend the RIO-based control imposed on the consumer market to all or part of the business market. To obtain their fixed RIO, users must call the toll-free number 3179 from their landline: and the RIO will be communicated to them verbally, and later confirmed in writing, using the method of their choice, including via SMS, e-mail or the post.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Since October 1, 2015, Enterprises and public services have three types of numbers available for providing their services: toll-free numbers, numbers charged at the “normal” rate, and premium rate numbers. Transparency for consumers will be ensured by the obligation to display calls to premium rate numbers on detailed telephone bills, and by the reverse directory created by operators and service providers (a special website is dedicated to this: infosva.org).

In July 2014, ARCEP set up a mobile telephony coverage and service quality monitoring survey. On July 30, 2015, ARCEP published the findings of its survey aimed at assessing mainland France mobile operators’ quality of service. Orange was found to be the operator with the highest overall score, with 153 indicators scoring above average, whether for telephony, SMS or data products. With 52 and 42 indicators scoring above average, respectively, the results for Bouygues Telecom and SFR were broadly similar. Free mobile, whose 3G network was still being deployed, scored considerably less well on a sizeable numbers of indicators, with only 9 indicators scoring above average. In addition to these publications on the quality of mobile services, the quality of access to fixed-line services and the quality of fixed telephony service, ARCEP, in 2015, continued work and the publication of its new half-yearly observatory on the quality of internet access services in mainland France On December 18, 2015, ARCEP published its findings regarding mobile coverage (2G, 3G, 4G) by the four operators for the month of July (Source: ARCEP). While the 2G and 3G coverage is uniformly high (above 80% in all cases and above 90% in most cases) for each of the operators and for each of population coverage and territorial coverage, 4G coverage is still lagging behind. With regard to 4G population coverage, Orange came first (76%), followed by Bouygues Telecom (72%), SFR (58%) and Free (52%). Only 28% of the territory is covered by Orange’s network, followed by Bouygues Telecom’ (24%), Free’s (18%) and SFR’s (15%). Since 2014, ARCEP assesses, the quality of the coverage and the general service quality provided by each single French operators on a yearly basis. ARCEP decision no. 2015-0833 of July 7, 2015 amending the mechanism for monitoring the quality of access to fixed-line services, entered into force on January 1, 2016. Additionally, law no. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on Economic Growth, Activity and Equal Economic Opportunities amended Article L33-12 of the CPCE, giving ARCEP greater flexibility in implementing measures relating to service quality and coverage of electronic communications networks and services. While these measures are implemented by operators, they are now subject to supervision by independent bodies selected by ARCEP, and the related costs are borne directly by the operators concerned. On October 22, 2019, ARCEP published the findings of its 20[th] annual audit to assess the quality of the services provided by mobile operators in metropolitan France based on 243 indicators for 2G/3G/4G.

The application procedure is administered by the Minister for Electronic Communications. All the operators who want to apply for the universal service provider position in France, have to propose their candidatures with their technical and financial conditions and the cost of their services. Orange was selected following the call for applications launched in 2017 for connection and telephone service components under Article L. 35-1 of the CPCE and was designated as service provider for these universal service components until November 2020. PagesJaunes, a provider, was chosen following the call for applications launched in 2011 for the provision of a subscribers’ directory in printed form and was designated as service provider for this universal service component until December 2014. To date, PageJaunes is still providing such universal services. Under Articles L. 35 et seq. of the CPCE, universal service obligations include (i) universal electronic communications service, (ii) additional services to universal electronic communications service and (iii) general interest missions in electronic communications, defense and security, public research and higher education. Universal electronic communications service includes (a) connection to a fixed public network and quality telephony service, in particular facsimile communications and data communications, at rates sufficient for access to the internet, as well as free handling of emergency calls, at an affordable price; (b) a directory enquiries service and a subscriber directory; (c) special measures for disabled end-users. Law no. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on economic growth, activity and equal economic opportunities removed access to public payphones from universal service. No universal service provider is selected any longer for directory enquiry services and directory information because of the competitive situation on their respective markets. Every year, ARCEP determines the net cost of universal service and puts in place a mechanism for shared financing between electronic communications operators in case of an unfair burden on the designated operator, for the period during which it was selected. In this case, ARCEP fixes operators’ contributions (provisional, then final) proportionally to their relevant revenues.

Ex ante asymmetric regulation is focused on market activities (mainly wholesale markets) in which distortions of competition and dominant market positions have been identified. Pursuant to the Framework Directive (replaced by the EECC), Regulation 2018/1971 establishing the BEREC and articles L. 371 to L. 38-1 of the CPCE, ARCEP is required, under the supervision of the European Commission and the BEREC, and on the basis of the recommendation of the Competition Authority, to (i) define the relevant markets in France, (ii) analyze the relevant markets and identify companies that have significant market power in these markets and (iii) decide whether or not to impose on these companies regulatory obligations commensurate with the competition problems identified. On July 31, 2020, ARCEP initiated a round of fixed telephone markets for businesses, covering the period running from 2021 to 2026. According to ARCEP, the aim of this analysis is to adapt its regulation to the context of a PSTN switch-off: in order to encourage a direct migration from the PSTN to fiber, the future infrastructure of reference, and to maintain the conditions for fair competition between incumbent carriers, Orange, and alternative operators during the transitional period. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

These decisions define the asymmetrical regulation of broadband and superfast broadband fixed markets and apply only to Orange, identified as the only operator exercising significant influence in these markets. As such, Orange is subject to specific obligations concerning access (unbundling of the copper local loop and access to its infrastructures), in particular meeting reasonable requests for access and providing access under non-discriminatory conditions at regulated pricing conditions. The unbundling of the Orange’s copper lines is the main line of action in terms of sector regulation. It is through unbundling that multiservice offers such as the “triple play” offers on telephone lines that can support them have developed in France. Unbundling requires operators to make considerable investments; the geographic coverage of operators is only extended gradually over the territory. Complementing unbundling, alternative operators have sometimes, on an infra-national basis, used wholesale offers of DSL run by Orange that enable them, to date, to market internet access services and telephone services over the entire territory in retail markets. This new framework defines non-discriminatory obligations that have been strengthened in accordance with the European Commission’s recommendation of September 11, 2013, on consistent non-discrimination obligations and costing methodologies to promote competition and enhance the broadband investment environment. On December 21, 2017, ARCEP adopted, through its decision no. 2017-1570, the following rate cap covering years 2016 to 2020 on access to Orange’s copper local loop: **2016** **2017** **2018** **2019** **2020** Monthly fee for unbundling .............................................** € 9.10 € 9.45 € 9.31 € 9.41 € 9.51 Total unbundling fees .......................................................** € 50 € 50 € 50 € 50 € 50",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

According to these four draft decisions, Orange will remain the only operator exercising significant influence on these markets for the period from 2020 to 2023 and, as such, subject to specific obligations concerning access (unbundling of the copper local loop and access to its infrastructures), in particular meeting reasonable requests for access and providing access under nondiscriminatory conditions at regulated pricing conditions, similar to those applicable for the fifth cycle. The four draft market analysis decisions will be notified to the European Commission by ARCEP and adopted before the end of 2020 (including amendments as the case may be).

Except in cases defined by the regulatory authority, access is to be provided under transparent and non-discriminatory conditions from a point located outside the limits of the private property, and which allows third-party operators to connect to it, under reasonable economic, technical and access conditions. Any refusal to provide this access must be justified. ARCEP has specified the regulatory framework and the principles set forth in Article L. 34-8-3 through several decisions and recommendations successively published since December 2009. These decisions organize rules for sharing the terminal portion of FTTH networks, i.e., downstream of the shared access point, in very densely populated areas and outside of them, in particular by specifying the obligations of the building operator regarding information provided to the commercial operator. The decision no. 2009-1106 of December 22, 2009 for example defines very high density areas as densely populated municipalities where infrastructure-based competition is possible, and stipulates that the list of municipalities that make up these areas could be adjusted should the need arise. ARCEP decision no. 2015-0776 of July 2, 2015 has specified and strengthened the obligations of building operators: they must guarantee the availability, traceability and non-discriminatory nature of information provided to commercial operators. On April 23, 2019, ARCEP required SFR to implement all the obligations relating to its entire Fiber to the Home (FTTH) network (outside dense territories) as imposed by decisions no. 2009-1106 and no. 2015-0776. In addition, Article 117 of law no. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on economic growth, activity and equal economic opportunities instituted the status of fiber-covered zone (zone fibrée) that can be obtained once the establishment or operation of a fiber optic network that is open to sharing are advanced enough to trigger measures facilitating the switch over to superfast broadband, i.e., promoting the migration from a copper local loop to optic local loop. On February 18, 2016, ARCEP launched an observatory on mobile network rollouts in sparsely populated areas and officially notified Bouygues Telecom and SFR to meet their next deadline to provide 4G coverage in sparsely populated areas. ARCEP has also decided to closely scrutinize Bouygues Telecom and SFR 4G rollouts in sparsely populated parts of France. ARCEP approved the draft agreement between the four operators (as part of the towncenters coverage programme since “Macron Law”) concluded to provide 2G and 3G coverage in the country’s town centres. Pursuant to law no. 2016-1321 of October 2016, article L. 33-11 of the CPCE and decree no. 2016-1182 of August 30, 2016, application for the status of fiber-covered zone must be made by the operator that rolls out the new fiber optic network, or by the local authority that established it under Article L. 1425-1 of the General Local Authorities Code. The status is granted by ARCEP after having emitted a favorable opinion, which lists the petitioner’s obligations. ----- Law no. 2018-1021 of November 23, 2018 has amended Article L. 1425-1 of the General Local Authorities Code to strengthen the obligation for any fiber network operator to grant access to their infrastructure when no other fiber network has been rolled out in the area. On February 6, 2020, ARCEP launched a public consultation on a draft decision and draft guidelines proposing changes to the specific “symmetric” regulatory framework governing fiber optic networks, which applies equally to all FTTH network operators. On July 7, 2020, after receiving the responses to that consultation, ARCEP submitted a new version of these two documents (i) to the French Competition Authority to obtain its opinion on the drafts and (ii) to a second public consultation that will be closed on September 14, 2020. ARCEP proposes in particular (i) to reinforce the obligations of all FTTH network operators regarding the obligation to grant a non-discriminatory access to FTTH networks and to offer a sufficient quality of service and (ii) to require all FTTH networks operators to propose a passive offer with increased quality of service (guaranteed fault repair times of 10 hours and 4 hours).

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.9,Regulatory framework specific to mobile operators,58.9.1,Obligations relating to networks and frequencies,"_Conditions for authorizations to use frequencies_ Article L. 33-1 of the CPCE authorizes mobile operators to use frequencies to establish and operate 2G, 3G and 4G generation networks. These frequencies can be used in accordance with the conditions laid down in the EECC and the conditions laid down by the licenses to use the frequencies granted by ARCEP. These instruments are supplemented by the harmonization decisions of the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT), as well as recommendations on the coordination of radio frequencies at borders. Within France, ARCEP lays down technical conditions for the use of radio frequencies for certain frequency bands. On January 14, 2018, the State and the operators entered into an agreement (the New Deal for Mobile) under which the operators committed to complete coverage in 4G, which commitments are included in their current licenses. The commitments aim to: - improve the quality of reception throughout the country; - increase the pace of targeted programs to improve coverage and within this framework to ensure that each operator builds at least 5,000 new sites; - generalize reception in 4G by equipping all mobile sites with 4G; - accelerate coverage of transport knots; and - generalize telephone coverage inside buildings, in particular by using voice over WiFi. Through a new decision no. 2020-0376 dated March 31, 2020, ARCEP modified the obligations imposed on operators, in particular in order to: - impose the publication of coverage maps for mobile radiotelephony services corresponding to the areas where the service is available; - specify the procedures for verifying the reliability of services coverage maps mobiles published by the operators; and - specify some of the methods for transmitting coverage maps to ARCEP. ----- _New frequency allocation schedule and reallocation of frequencies_ Following the allocation of frequencies in the 700 MHz band, new frequencies bands will be allocated in France in the years ahead (900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2.1 GHz bands). ARCEP reallocated said frequencies on November 15, 2018 (ARCEP decision no. 18-1393). SFR’s licenses to use frequencies will expire as follows: - On March 24, 2031 for the 900 and 1800 MHz frequencies; - On August 20, 2031 for the 2.1 GHz frequency; - On June 7, 2030 for the 2.1 GHz frequency that was granted in 2010; - On October 10, 2031 for the 2.6 GHz frequency; and - On December 7, 2035 for the 700 MHz frequency. _4G frequency refarming_ The 1800 MHz band is one of the two frequency bands that have historically been used by 2G networks. It is now due to progressively be reused more efficiently by 4G services. Consequently, the terms of mobile operators’ licenses need to be amended to lift the 2G-only restriction they contain. To make the band technology-neutral and to prepare for its reuse by 4G services, ARCEP published in March 2013, a guidance document for the introduction of technological neutrality in the 1800 MHz band (definition of the method applied in case of early request for the introduction of technological neutrality, i.e., before May 25, 2016, under the terms of Ordinance No. 2011-1012 of August 24, 2011 on the transposition of Directive 2009/140/CE) or before this date if the parties that hold licenses in that band so request. ARCEP put these guidelines into effect when Bouygues Telecom requested that the technological restrictions listed in its license be lifted. As a result: - Bouygues Telecom was authorized to use 4G at 1800 MHz from October 1, 2013 by ARCEP Decision No. 13-0514 of April 4, 2013. - Free Mobile was authorized to use technologically neutral frequencies at 1800 MHz under ARCEP Decision No. 14-1542 of December 16, 2014. - As for Orange and SFR, ARCEP authorized them to deploy 4G networks in the 1800 MHz starting on May 25, 2016 pursuant to Decision Nos. 2015-0975 and 2015-0976. - Starting from June 13, 2017, SFR was also authorised to use 4G at 2.1 MHz by ARCEP Decision no. 2017-0735. _5G frequency allocation_ On September 14, 2016, the European Commission unveiled an action plan for the deployment of 5G networks throughout Europe and the harmonization of infrastructure technical specifications. In this context, decree no. 2019-1592 of December 31, 2019, initiated the 5G public tender and the ministerial decree of December 30, 2019 determined modalities and conditions for the tender. Under the 5G auction, 31 frequencies in the 10 MHz band will be allocated as follows: - Four blocks of 50 MHz are expected to be allocated at a set price provided the operators agree on several commitments detailed in the tender specifications; and - The remaining frequencies will be allocated through an auction process, per blocks of 10 MHz. ----- SFR, Orange, Free Mobile and Bouygues Telecom have confirmed their intention to obtain one of the four blocks of 50 MHz. On April 2, 2020, ARCEP announced that: - the four candidates were qualified; and - the four candidates had made the commitments set out in the specifications, and each will be able to obtain a block of 50 MHz at the end of this procedure, for the sum of €350 million. The commitments that the four candidates made to obtain 50 MHz of spectrum are as follows: - _5G to foster competitiveness in other sectors of the French economy: Implementation of a mechanism established by ARCEP that will have operators commit to accede to reasonable requests from economic actors (such as, business, local authorities, administrations) by providing them with customised solutions in terms of coverage and performance or, if the operator prefers, by assigning its frequencies locally. - _Indoor coverage: the commitments seek to improve indoor coverage for business and commercial purposes, and to facilitate coverage by multiple operators. - _Fixed access products: commitments also concern the supply of dedicated fixed access products on mobile networks. - _Greater transparency: the commitments include increasing operators’ transparency, both on their rollout forecasts and service outages. - _Bolster innovation and competition: commitments are intended to improve MVNO hosting on operators’ 5G networks, in particular to stimulate innovation from all the sector’s players. The four candidates are now authorised to participate in the auction process during which the 11 blocks of 10 MHz that remain available in the 3.4 – 3.8 GHz band will be awarded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the main auction to award the remaining 11 blocks of 10 MHz has been postponed. Their allocation is scheduled to be launched on September 29, 2020. This main auction will be followed by a positioning auction in October 2020 to determine the winning candidates’ position on the band, and then by the award of the licences, which is expected to take place in October or November 2020. ARCEP wishes to focus on 4G coverage in the country’s more sparsely populated areas. Thus, alongside the New Deal for Mobile, ARCEP announced on June 11, 2020 that the licenses that will be awarded will also carry obligations to strengthen 4G access. In particular, operators will be required to ensure that a minimum of 75% of their cell sites are 4G+ enabled by the end of 2022. The widespread availability of 4G+ (increasing networks’ capacity to at least 240 Mbit/s, i.e., four times the current obligation) will be guaranteed in every region. ARCEP is calling on operators to step up their efforts in this area, in particular as the initial roadmap for 5G investments has been delayed. _Network sharing_ As stated in ARCEP Opinion No. 2012-1627 of December 20, 2012, while competition through infrastructure is important in ensuring competitive dynamics and a high level of investment, the sharing of networks is not incompatible with the goal of promoting competition. In a context of increased competitive pressure, and even as investment requirements remain significant, in particular in the rollout of 4G, the sharing of networks can offer operators a means to cut costs and deliver gains to users in terms of extending coverage and improving service quality. The sharing of networks and frequencies is encouraged and even imposed in France through several specific mechanisms aimed at achieving the shared goal of expanding mobile coverage across the national territory: ----- - the “white zones” program initiated in 2003 under the auspices of the Minister for Regional Planning and ARCEP, to provide 2G coverage to the village centers of about 3,300 municipalities; - an agreement on 3G network sharing, in accordance with ARCEP Decision No. 2009-329 of April 9, 2009, signed on February 11, 2010 by three mobile operators (SFR, Orange and Bouygues Telecom), providing for the sharing of 3G network infrastructure among mobile operators in the country’s less densely populated areas. The agreement was supplemented by the signing of an agreement on July 23, 2010 with Free Mobile setting out arrangements for its deferred joining mechanism; and - obligations to share networks and frequencies arising from authorizations to use 4G frequencies, providing that authorization holders cover, within a maximum period of 15 years (until January 2027), the village centers of municipalities located in the “white zones” and requiring that they jointly carry out the sharing of the 800 MHz band; - incentives to share frequencies arising from authorizations to use 4G frequencies in the 700 MHz band (Bouygues Telecom, Free Mobile, Orange and SFR) also providing that their holders cover, within a maximum period of 15 years (until January 2027), the village centers of municipalities located in the “white zone” and urging them to sign framework agreements providing for a schedule and conditions under which, where necessary, the sharing of frequencies in the 700 MHz band will take place; On May 27, 2014, by Decision No. 2014-0625-RDPI, ARCEP opened an administrative investigation into four mobile network operators with regard to their obligations to provide 3G coverage in less densely populated areas of the country in accordance with the agreement to share 3G network infrastructure in those areas. Article L.348-5 inserted in the CPCE Law No. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on Economic Growth, Activity and Equal Economic Opportunities provides for the signing of a new agreement among the State, local authorities and mobile network operators aimed at ensuring coverage of less densely populated areas. In anticipation of that arrangement, a memorandum of understanding was signed by mobile operators in May 2015, under which operators are bound to provide 2G coverage to the “white zones” by the end of 2016 and 3G coverage to the same zones by mid-2017. Apart from these specific arrangements, the conditions under which network or frequency sharing agreements in general can be carried out by mobile operators were specified by the Competition Authority in an opinion issued on March 11, 2013. On January 31, 2014, SFR and Bouygues Telecom announced the signing of an agreement on the sharing of part of their mobile networks (see “Business of the Group—Material Contracts—Wireless Network Agreements— _Bouygues Telecom Agreement”). In a press release issued on January 31, 2014, ARCEP welcomed the agreement,_ provided that three conditions are met: (i) maintenance of the operators’ strategic and commercial autonomy; (ii) absence of foreclosure effects; and (iii) improvement of the services provided to users in terms of coverage and quality of service. In addition, the signing of the agreement was referred to the Competition Authority by Orange on April 29, 2014. The Competition Authority’s approval of the SFR and Bouygues Telecom agreement was thereafter amended several times, such amendments being examined and approved by ARCEP. On June 16, 2016, after public consultation, ARCEP adopted guidelines on network sharing. Said guidelines were challenged before the Conseil d’Etat by Bouygues Telecom and Free. Their requests for annulment of the guidelines were dismissed by the Conseil d’Etat on December 15, 2017. An amendment to the sharing agreement between Bouygues Telecom and SFR has been submitted to ARCEP on February 25, 2020. _National Roaming_ Roaming is another form of infrastructure sharing between operators under which an operator receives the customers of another operator on its network. Only the host operator’s frequencies are used. Roaming is implemented in France through several sets of specific measures including, in particular, (i) the “white zones” program initiated in 2003 and referred to above, (ii) the arrangement concerning Free Mobile’s 2G and 4G roaming rights and (iii) the general provisions of Article L. 34-8-1 of the CPCE. ----- In its 3G authorization, Free Mobile had a roaming right on the network of one of the three 2G operators until January 2016. In March 2011, Free Mobile signed a 2G roaming agreement with Orange, later extended to 3G, which was in force until 2018. On January 12, 2016, using its new power from the Macron Law, ARCEP hastened the end of the roaming arrangements between Free Mobile and Orange. Orange and Free have extended this contract for two more years on February 19, 2020. The contract amendment extends the sunset period for Free Mobile’s access to nationwide roaming on Orange’s 2G and 3G networks up to December 31, 2022. ARCEP is in the process of examining this contractual amendment, in particular with respect to regulatory objectives and the May 25, 2016 guidelines. Free Mobile also has a 4G roaming right on the network of SFR, under which it obtained two 4G frequency blocks in the 800 MHz band.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

This is identical to international roaming, when a user from France travels abroad, or a foreign user is travelling in France On January 21, 2016, ARCEP provided the Government with its opinion on roaming charges in France’s overseas markets. In 2015, the Government had solicited ARCEP’s expertise to inform the debate over the Law no. 20151268 on updating laws in French overseas departments and territories, which ultimately inserted a provision into the CPCE that puts an end to roaming fees for mobile telephone calls and short text messages (SMS) for users travelling between Metropolitan and overseas France, starting on May 1, 2016. ARCEP considers that this new provision will substantially destabilize overseas markets. Law no. 2015-990 of August 6, 2015 on Economic Growth, Activity and Equal Economic Opportunities amended the CPCE, giving ARCEP new prerogatives in terms of network sharing and allows ARCEP, after obtaining the opinion of the Competition Authority, to request the amendment of existing agreements, by specifying their geographical limits, term or conditions for their implementation. On January 12, 2016, ARCEP published draft guidelines for public consultation, in order to provide operators with greater visibility regarding the consequences of this change in legal framework.

The Macron Law added a new Article L. 34-8-5 to the CPCE pursuant to which the French State, local governmental authorities and mobile operators may conclude an agreement defining the conditions of coverage of zones where no mobile service was then available. The agreement defines the conditions under which local governmental authorities can, after having determined that private initiatives are lacking, put certain types of infrastructure at the disposal of a service provider in order to provide 3G mobile services in such un-serviced zones. ARCEP Decision no. 2012-0855 on the reorganization of number ranges starting with 06 and 07 provides for the creation of a mobile number range extending to 14 digits in mainland France and a ban on the use of 10-digit mobile numbers for Machine-to-Machine (“M2M”) communication services in mainland France effective January 1, 2016.

Concerning mobile voice call termination markets (market 7), every mobile and Full MVNO operator is deemed to exercise significant influence on the market for the termination it provides on its individual network. As such, the decision in particular imposes rate control obligations on each operator and sets the following caps for mobile voice call termination: Until December 31, 2014, a c€0.08/min cap for operators in mainland France and c€1/min for overseas operators, corresponding to the last caps the previous market analysis imposed; - From January 1, 2015, a c€0.78/min cap for 1 year; - From January 1, 2016, a c€0.76/min cap for 1 year; and - From January 1, 2017, a c€0.074/min cap for 1 year. The voice call termination rates of all operators regulated in France are in line with the European Commission recommendation of May 7, 2009 on the regulatory treatment of fixed and mobile termination rates in the European Union: they are symmetrical and directed towards the long-run incremental costs of an efficient generic operator. Owing to ARCEP’s speedy implementation of this recommendation, France is one of the European Union countries where mobile voice call termination rates are lowest. A draft decision establishing the fifth round analysis of the wholesale markets for fixed voice call terminations and SMS mobile voice call terminations in mainland and overseas France for the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020 was transmitted by ARCEP to the European Commission by the end of 2017.

Under a new decision no. 2016-0244 of February 18, 2016, ARCEP sent a formal notice to SFR inviting the operator to respect their commitment of 4G coverage before January 17, 2017 (in January 2016 the 4G coverage of SFR was 8% where such coverage has to be 40% of coverage 2017).

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.20,Legal Status of Networks,58.20.1,Specific Characteristics of the Cable Network,"_Networks utilizing Orange’s infrastructure_ In 1982, the French Government launched the Cable Plan (instituted by the laws of July 29, 1982 and of August 1, 1984). Pursuant to the Cable Plan, the cable network was initially built by the French Government prior to being transferred to Orange (the incumbent telecommunications operator in France). The network was initially operated by certain local entities funded by both private and public funds that the Group subsequently acquired. During such acquisitions, Orange granted the Group several IRUs over its infrastructure, which primarily consisted of ducts. These IRUs were entered into at different periods of time, and each granted the Group IRUs over Orange’s infrastructure for 20 years. The renewal of the first IRU is scheduled to be negotiated with Orange in 2019. In compliance with ARCEP decision 2008-0835 of July 24, 2008, on September 15, 2008, Orange published a technical and pricing quotation regarding third party access to its civil local loop fiber optic infrastructure, ----- enabling third party telecommunications operators to deploy their own fiber optic networks through the use of Orange’s ducts. Orange invoked this ARCEP decision to unilaterally modify its IRU agreements with the Group in 2010, making the Group’s contractual conditions to access Orange’s facilities substantially more complicated and restricted as far as the Group’s optical fiber network management and extension process is concerned. The case with regard to SFR Fibre’s claims against Orange was dismissed by the Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) on March 27, 2019. Therefore, by writ of summons dated October 7, 2010, SFR Fibre filed an action against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris, seeking damages for breach of contract in the amount of €2,400 million and/or a €894 millions award as reimbursement by Orange of the sums initially paid by the Group in consideration of the 20 year contractual term agreed in each IRU contract. _New Deal Plan_ In 1986, the government launched the Plan Nouvelle Donne (the “New Deal Plan”) pursuant to law 86-1067 of September 30, 1986 on the freedom of communication. This new regulatory framework authorized public local authorities to either build their own networks, or alternatively, to have such networks built by private entities. Several private entities that the Group subsequently acquired were commissioned to build such networks and secured both occupancy and usage rights as well as concessions to operate such networks for 20-30 year periods. The New Deal Plan did not involve the use of standard-form contracts. Consequently, uncertainty arose surrounding the ownership of networks under certain long-term contracts between telecommunications operators and regional and local authorities. A main source of uncertainty related to contracts identified as “public service delegation contracts”. Under a public service delegation contract, infrastructure and equipment used to provide public services are considered to be ‘returnable assets’ and consequently revert free of charge to local authorities upon the expiration or termination of the contract. Law 2004-669 of July 9, 2004, which transposed the 2002 Telecoms Package into French law, imposed an obligation on local authorities to refrain from granting exclusive contractual rights for the establishment and/or operation of networks. In addition, law 2008-776 of August 4, 2008 authorized local authorities to grant rights of access to their networks to competitors of the Group, even in instances where such rights of access would be contrary to contractual obligations of local authorities under agreements entered into with the Group. In a July 2007 report, ARCEP opined that while consequent disagreements related to the breach of such contractual obligations could only be definitively decided by the judiciary on a case-by-case basis depending on the wording of each individual contract, contracts entered into between private operators and local authorities after 1990 (following law 90-1170 of December 29, 1990, which enabled municipalities to operate independent telecommunications networks within the framework of the Plan Nouvelle Donne) were deemed public service delegation contracts and therefore integrated the idea of networks as “returnable assets” which revert to local authorities upon contractual expiration or termination. In order to clarify the conditions for compliance related to agreements entered into prior to the imposition of law 2004-699, the Group proposed, in May 2010, to ARCEP that ownership of civil infrastructure under such agreements (i.e., ducts) should be granted to local authorities while ownership of telecommunications equipment and existing cables should be granted to the Group through a process of transfer. This proposal resulted in the standardization of settlement agreements which incorporated the Group’s proposal. Under the new standardized agreements, the Group also obtained non-exclusive rights to use its own telecommunications equipment in ducts located on public property that had reverted to local authorities. The nonexclusive nature of these rights also enabled the Group’s competitors to install and use their own equipment in such ducts. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legislative and Regulatory Matters—The legal status of the Group’s _network is complex and in certain cases subject to challenges or renewals” for a description of the risks associated_ with the legal status of the Group’s network.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

These components may be subject to differing legal and regulatory considerations. As a consequence of the fact that the Group’s physical infrastructure is built on both public property and private property owned by third parties, the Group has signed concessions agreements, farming contracts, public property occupancy agreements and leases with various property owners. The Group also benefits from certain easements and indefeasible rights of use (“IRUs”) granted by land owners. The Group has also entered into certain agreements with Orange regarding use of its infrastructure. The Group has built its network by acquiring and combining entities with established networks under differing regulatory regimes. Such entities previously operated under a combination of the regulatory frameworks described below. Telecommunications equipment may be owned directly by telecommunications operators or third parties and several telecommunications operators may occupy and utilize the same infrastructure. In accordance with Articles L. 2122-2 and L. 2122-3 of the general public property code, regional and local authorities may terminate public property occupancy agreements at any time by demonstrating that such action is in the public interest. Moreover, upon the expiration of a public property occupancy agreement, the occupant may be contractually obligated to: (i) return the entire network to regional or local authorities, in some cases for consideration corresponding to the fair market value of the network, and in other cases in absence of any consideration, (ii) remove the entire network at the expense of the occupant or the regional or local authorities, (iii) transfer the network to other operators approved by regional or local authorities or (iv) repurchase the network.

As a distributor of radio, television and on-demand media services, the Group is required make certain disclosures regarding its operations to the CSA. Pursuant to Articles 42-1 and 42-2 of law 86-1067 of September 30, 1986, the CSA may sanction operators found to be in breach of the regulatory framework. Such sanctions include the mandatory suspension from the distribution of services and a fine of up to 3% of the operator’s annual revenues, or 5% in the event of repeated breaches. As a distributor of audiovisual services, the Group is subject to certain “must-carry” obligations which require cable, satellite or ADSL service providers to provide certain mandatory services on its network. These must-carry obligations are governed by Articles 34-2, 34-4 and 34-5 of law 86-1067 of September 30, 1986. Article 34-2 provides that all network types operating outside of the terrestrial frequencies allocated by the CSA must include the following television channels to subscribers free of charge: France 2, France 3, France 5, Arte, TV5, France Ô and La Chaîne Parlementaire. In addition, where a digital offering is concerned, France 4 must also be provided free of charge. For non-satellite offerings, distributors must provide their subscribers with local public initiative services intended to inform the public of local activities. Pursuant to Article 34-4 of law no. 86-1067 of September 30, 1986, all French private terrestrial television channels (e.g., TF1 or M6) can demand that their programs be carried by the distribution network operators (cable, satellite, ADSL and mobile devices) and the latter must allow an access to the decoders and reference the programs of this channel in its TV guides. The French constitutional, in Decision no. 2004-497 of July 1, 2004, confirmed that pursuant this article, the private television channels have a right of access to decoders and a right of access to TV guides of the distributors. Article 34-5 requires that digital electronic communications networks air all of France 3’s regional programs. The CSA is also empowered to regulate the content of the services distributed in France. Article 15 of law 861067 of September 30, 1986 provides that the CSA must enact rules to protect minors against programs which are considered to be dangerous to physical and mental health. The CSA has accordingly enacted strict rules regarding the use of specific pictograms on programs that are deemed to be unsuitable for minors. As an operator and distributor of television services, the Group ensures strict compliance with such regulations.

Additional provisions are contained in Law n° 2004-575 of June 21, 2004 on Confidence in the Digital Economy, which states that operators offering access to an electronic communications network do not have the general obligation to review the content they transmit or store. The civil or criminal liability of an operator offering access to an electronic communications network can be sought only if it initiates the transmission, selects the receiver of the transmission or selects or modifies the information contained in the transmission. Legislative provisions were also introduced by law no. 2010-476 of May 12, 2010, updated by order no. 20192015, to facilitate competition and to regulate online gambling and the gaming sector more generally. Law 2011267 of March 14, 2011 on the policy and programming of the performance of internal security processes requires access providers to block access to certain websites and online content, such as illegal gambling sites and content involving sexual abuse of children, at the request of the French Online Gambling Regulatory Authority, which became the National Gambling Authority on January 1, 2020, or the Ministry of Interior (ministère de l’intérieur). Laws 2018-1201 and 2018-1202 of December 22, 2018, have stepped up the fight against information manipulation. First, online platforms are subject to an obligation of transparency in political campaigns, in ----- particular with respect to the information relating to the person or company paying for advertisements (Article L. 163-1 of the French Electoral Code). Second, online platforms are required to take measures to prevent the dissemination of false information that may disturb public order or alter the accuracy of votes. To meet this requirement, they must set up a system enabling users to report false information, as well as additional measures such as “algorithm transparency”, “banning accounts that massively spread false information” or “informing _users about the nature, origin and methods of content dissemination”. These measures, as well as the resources_ devoted to them, must be made public and communicated annually to the CSA, to become the “Autorité de régulation de la communication audiovisuelle et numérique”. Third, a special emergency procedure has been enacted in Article L. 163-2 of the Electoral Code, making it possible, in the three months preceding elections, to refer to the judge in charge of emergency applications (juge des référés) any “deliberate, artificial or automated _and massive online dissemination” of inaccurate or misleading information that may alter the sincerity of the_ election. The judge may order internet service providers to stop any such dissemination within 48 hours. On July 9, 2019, the French National Assembly adopted a bill to curb hateful content online. The bill requires online platforms above a specified threshold to remove within 24 hours of a formal demand content inciting hate or abuse on the grounds of race, religion, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation or disability. Once removed, the harmful content shall be kept during one year in case of criminal investigation. The penalty for failing to comply may reach 4% of the platform’s worldwide turnover. The bill was adopted by the French Parliament on May 13, 2020 but its content was almost entirely censured by the Constitutional Council. On September 12, 2018, the EU Commission presented its proposal for a new EU Regulation fighting online terrorist content. The Commission proposed a legally binding one-hour deadline for removing content following a removal order from the relevant national authorities. Member States would have to put in place effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for not complying with removal orders. If a service provider systematically fails to comply with removal orders, it could face severe financial penalties. The proposed EU regulation has been adopted by the EU Parliament on April 17, 2019. The EU Council has not yet examined the text. On October 18, 2019, the French Parliament adopted law no. 2019-1063 to modernise the press distribution.

On October 28, 2009, law 2009-1311 was passed to supplement the ‘graduated response’ system by providing that in the event of repeat infringement, a judge may impose a fine or suspend the Internet access of the individual responsible for the illegal download. This latter sanction was nevertheless later repealed by decree 2013-596 of July 8, 2013. The president of a French court may issue, through a fast-track procedure, orders requiring internet service providers to block access to websites that infringe third party rights (Article L. 336-2 of the French Intellectual Property Code; Article 6-I-8 of the Law n° 2004-575 of June 21, 2004 among others). The costs are borne by the internet service providers. Measures to modernize copyright rules (especially the Directive 2001/29/EC) in light of the digital revolution and new consumer behavior have been announced by the European Commission, as part of an ambitious legislative program to create a Digital Single Market. The “Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe”, set out in the Commission Communication of May 6, 2015, outlined key areas for legislative action to create a more modern European copyright framework, and to improve access to digital content, as part of its pillar on “Better online access for consumers and businesses across Europe”. EU Regulation 2017/1128 of June 14, 2017 on cross-border portability of online content services in the internal market aims at ensuring that consumers who buy or subscribe to films, sport broadcasts, music, e-books and games can access them when they travel in other EU countries. ----- On March 26, 2019, European Parliament adopted the new Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market, which provides (i) that the largest online platforms are directly liable for content uploaded by users, (ii) for a special ancillary right protecting the work of designers and news publishers that is used by online platforms and (iii) for new exceptions to copyright allowing users to freely use copyrighted material for data mining purposes or to preserve cultural heritage. On April 15, the European Council adopted the Directive. On May 17, 2019, the Directive has been published in the Official Journal of the EU. Member States will then have 24 months to enact the new rules into their national legislation. Whether Member States will adopt consistent or differing interpretations of the Directive remains to be seen, being specified that Poland already filed a complaint against such Directive before the European Court of Justice. In France, law no. 2019-775 enacted on July 24, 2019, which transposed part of the Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market, creates a specific ancillary right for news agencies and press publishers. Article L. 218-2, which entered into force on October 24, 2019, provides that online communication service providers are required to obtain prior authorization from publishers of online news services or news agencies prior to any reproduction or communication to the public of all or part of their press publications in a digital form. Consequently, online communication service providers using all or part of a press article must compensate press publishers. This special ancillary right will expire two years after the press publication is published, starting as from January 1 of the year following the date on which that press publication is published.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,58,REGULATION,58.22,Regulation of electronic communications content,58.22.3,Processing of personal data and privacy protection,"The processing of personal data is governed since May 25, 2018 by EU Regulation 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”). The GDPR has replaced EU Directive 95/46/EC on privacy protection regarding the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data and modified a number of data protection principles. The GDPR removes all prior formalities that data controllers were required to carry out with the French Data Protection Authority (“Commission Nationale de l’Informatique et des Libertés” or “CNIL”) before implementing a new processing. These formalities are replaced by a new accountability principle, which makes data controllers responsible for demonstrating compliance with the data protection principles. In particular, they must conduct and document a data protection impact assessment before implementing a processing which is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects. Data controllers and processors must also comply with the principles of privacy by design and by default, maintain a record of their processing activities and, in certain cases, appoint a data protection officer. When a data controller uses the services of a data processor, it is required to conclude a contract that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. The contract must also contain all the mandatory provisions listed in article 28 of the GDPR. The GDPR enshrines a wide range of existing and new rights for individuals in respect of their personal data. These include the right to be forgotten, the right to request the porting of one’s personal data to a new organization, the right to object to certain processing activities or to decisions taken by automated processes. Data controllers must reply to data subjects’ requests within one month. The GDPR empowers the data protection authorities to impose fines up to the higher of €10 million or 2% of a company’s global turnover, in case of certain breaches of data protection laws, and up to €20 million or 4% of the company’s global turnover in case of breaches of the basic principles of data collection or the violation of data subjects’ rights. After an initial transition period, data protection authorities across the EU have now begun using their new sanctioning powers (in 2019, Google was fined €50 million by the French authority (CNIL), British Airways and Marriott were provisionally fined respectively £183 million and £99 million by the UK authority (ICO), and many cases are currently under investigation). In addition to the GDPR, Law n° 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on information technology, files and individual freedom (modified by Law n° 2018-493 of June 20, 2018, its implementing decree n° 2018-687 of August 1, 2018 its rewriting Order n°2018-1225 of December 12, 2018 to be adapted to the GDPR and implementing decree n° 2019536 of May 30, 2019) governs the data processing activities of companies established in France. Article 58 of the 1978 Law requires data controllers, including providers of public electronic communication services (operators) to notify forthwith the French Data protection authority, CNIL, of a breach of personal data. ----- When such a personal data breach might impact an individual’s personal data or privacy, the data controller must also notify that person without delay, unless the CNIL determines that adequate protective measures have been implemented (for example, as a result of encryption) and that the personal data breach is assessed by the CNIL as not being material. Data controllers must keep an updated record of all breaches of personal data (conditions, effects and remedial measures taken) and must make said record available to the CNIL upon request. Additional national legislation include Law No. 2016-1321 of October 7, 2016 for a Digital Republic, which sets up: - open data policy for government data; - principle of network neutrality and data portability; - payment by SMS; - a limited right to maintain an internet connection households experiencing payment difficulties may receive financial assistance from a universal solidarity fund and their connection is to be maintained by their access provider while their assistance request is under examination). The Group is required to retain certain data in compliance with a variety of laws and regulations. Accordingly, the Group may be required to relinquish information in its possession regarding the identity, location and connection information of a user to duly authorized judicial or administrative authorities (Article L. 34-1 of the CPCE). The information subject to mandatory relinquishment does not include the content of a user’s communications or the information consulted by the user. The data categories falling within the scope of this requirement are set out in Articles R10-12 and seq. of the CPCE. These requirements were supplemented within the framework of law 2015-912 of July 24, 2015 on intelligence (amended by Law n°2016-987 of July 21, 2016 and Law n°2017-1510 of October 30, 2017), which notably states that for the sole purpose of anti-terrorism, information or documents relating to an individual who has been pre-determined to pose a threat may be collected in real time on an operator’s network (Article L. 851-2 of the Internal Security Code). In accordance with Articles L. 852-1 and seq. of the Internal Security Code, the Group can also intercept electronic communications transmitted via its networks at the request of duly authorized judicial and administrative authorities. Upon authorization by the Prime Minister and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, Law n° 2015-912 (modified by Law n°2016-987 of July 21, 2016 and Law n°2017-1510 of October 30, 2017) also enables authorities to use automated processing techniques for the detection of connections likely to reveal terrorist threats through the use of an operator’s network. Law n°2019-486 dated May 22, 2019 authorizes Competition Authority and DGCCRF agents to access, for the purposes of their investigations, connection data stored and processed by telecommunications operators, subject to prior authorization from the controller of connection data requests (Article L. 450-3-3 new of the French Commercial Code). Articles R450-4 to R450-8 of the French Commercial Code set out the communication procedure regarding such data (Decree n°2019-1247 of November 28, 2019).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Article L33-1 of the CPCE obligate operators to notify security and integrity breaches of public electronic communications networks and services, to ARCEP. Under articles D. 98-3 to D98-7 of the CPCE, operators: - shall take all measures necessary to ensure the security of communications using their networks. - shall take measures to protect its facilities, networks, and services against threats, risks from any cause. - must be able to respond to the government’s national defence requirements and to remedy the most serious consequences of failures or destructions of facilities. ----- Must ensure secrecy of correspondence transmitted by means of telecommunications. Military Program Law n°2018-607 of July 13, 2018 and its implementing decree n°2018-136 of December 13, 2018 authorise operators to set up “devices using technical markers solely for the purpose of detecting events that _may affect the security of their subscribers’ information systems” (Article 33-14 of the CPCE). These devices may_ be used either on the initiative of the electronic communications operators themselves—in which case they must inform the French cybersecurity watchdog (ANSSI)—or at the request of the ANSSI itself. Article L 2321-2-1 of the French Defence Code provides that ANSSI may use the above-mentioned devices directly on an operator’s network in the event of a serious and imminent threat to the systems of a public authority, a vital operator (“OIV”) or an essential service operator (“OSE”). Law n° 2018-133 of February 26, 2018 implementing the “Network and Information Security” Directive into French law and its implementing decree (decree n° 2018-384 of 23 May 2018) impose new network and information security requirements on operators of essential services and digital service providers: they must take appropriate security measures to manage the risks posed to the network and information systems, in order to prevent and minimize the impact of incidents affecting the security of their network and information systems and to ensure the continuity of their services. Law n° 2019-810 of August 1, 2019 (as codified in Articles L34-11 and seq. of the CPCE) regarding the preservation of French defence and national security interests for the operation of mobile radio networks, and its decree n° 2019-1300 of December 6, 2019, established a prior authorisation mechanism to be granted by the French Prime Minister for all radio equipment and devices allowing the connection to a mobile network. This process ensures that the equipment and devices to be used for the development and implementation of the 5G networks will have no major security risks. Criminal penalties are applicable in the absence of said prior authorisation.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes as described under “—Optional _Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than the date that is 60_ days after any Change of Control Triggering Event or, at the Issuer’s option, at any time prior to a Change of Control Triggering Event following the public announcement thereof or if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control, the Issuer will send a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”) to each Holder of any such Notes by mail or otherwise in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture, with a copy to the Trustee (1) stating that a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional ----- Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the relevant interest payment date) (the “Change of Control Payment”); (2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 10 days from the date such notice is mailed nor later than the later of 60 days from the date such notice is mailed and 60 days after the Change of Control Triggering Event) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) and the record date; (3) stating that any Note accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date unless the Change of Control Payment is not paid, and that any Notes or part thereof not tendered will continue to accrue interest; (4) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control Triggering Event; (5) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; (6) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control Triggering Event; and (7) certain other procedures that a holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer or to withdraw such acceptance. The Issuer shall cause to be published the notice described above in a leading newspaper having a general circulation in London (which is expected to be the Financial Times) or through the newswire service of Bloomberg (or if Bloomberg does not then operate, any similar agency). In addition, if and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of any Change of Control Offer as required by such rules. The ability of the Issuer to repurchase Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Issuer may not be able _to obtain enough funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture.”_ On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control Triggering Event shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the relevant Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Notes or portions of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the U.S. Paying Agent (in the case of the Dollar Global Notes) or to the Euro Paying Agent (in the case of the Euro Global Notes) the applicable Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agents, at the Issuer’s expense, will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly instruct its authenticating agent to authenticate and, at the Issuer’s expense, mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €100,000 in principal amount and integral ----- multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes, and at least $200,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Dollar Notes. For so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer will publish a notice with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer as required by such rules. The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Indenture are applicable. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control Triggering Event if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control Triggering Event, conditional upon such Change of Control Triggering Event, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of making of the Change of Control Offer. The provisions of the Indenture will not afford holders of the Notes the right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, certain transactions with the Issuer’s management or its Affiliates or certain other sale transactions, including a takeover, reorganization, recapitalization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction (including, in certain circumstances, an acquisition of the Issuer by management or its Affiliates) involving the Issuer that may adversely affect holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction defined as a Change of Control Triggering Event. The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The existing indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries contains, and its respective future indebtedness may also contain, prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a “change of control” thereunder or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon such a change of control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control Triggering Event itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s and its Restricted Subsidiaries’ then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Issuer may not be able to obtain enough funds necessary to _finance an offer to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) as required by the Indenture.”_ The definition of “Change of Control” includes a direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to a Person (including any “person” (as that term is used in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act)), other than a Permitted Holder. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. Holders of the Notes may not be entitled to require the Issuer to purchase their Notes in certain circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of Altice Europe’s board of directors, including in connection with a proxy contest, where Altice Europe’s board of directors initially publicly opposes the election of a dissident slate of directors, but subsequently approves such directors for the purposes of the Indenture. This may result in a change in the composition of the board of directors that, but for such subsequent approval, would have otherwise constituted a Change of Control requiring a repurchase offer under the terms of the Indenture. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. ----- The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided that any Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date (after giving effect to the Transactions) under the Revolving Credit Facility shall not be deemed Incurred on the Issue Date under clause 4(b) of the second paragraph of this covenant; (2) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (3) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (8), (14) or (16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (5) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and (6) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant. The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness”, the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant). For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or at the option of the Issuer, the date first committed; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable eurodenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date ----- of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a currency other than euro is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such Indebtedness is denominated covering principal amount and interest payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness, will be the Euro Equivalent of the principal payment required to be made under such Currency Agreement plus the Euro Equivalent of any premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement. For purposes of determining compliance with the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, or at the option of the Issuer, the date first committed; _provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other_ than euro, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such euro-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced plus any amount to pay premiums (including tender premiums), accrued and unpaid interest, expenses, defeasance costs and fees in connection therewith; and (b) the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. In addition, for purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio to test compliance with any covenant in the Indenture, in determining the amount of Indebtedness outstanding in euro on any date of determination, with respect to any Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than euro (the “Foreign Currency”): (1) subject to a currency swap arrangement or contract, the aggregate principal amount of such Foreign Currency Indebtedness on any such date of determination shall be the euro amount of the aggregate principal amount to be paid by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary on the maturity date of such currency swap arrangement or contract pursuant to the terms thereof; or (2) subject to a currency forward arrangement, forward accretion curve or contract, the aggregate principal amount of such Foreign Currency Indebtedness shall be converted into euro at the exchange rate specified under the terms of such currency forward arrangement, forward accretion curve or contract as applicable to such Foreign Currency Indebtedness on such date of determination. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding a Group member entering into any such arrangement or contract hedging foreign exchange exposure of any Foreign Currency Indebtedness, for the purposes of calculating the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness subject to any such arrangement or contract shall be attributed to the total Indebtedness of the Person that originally Incurred such Indebtedness.

No such purchase in part shall reduce the principal amount at maturity of the Notes held by any holder to below €100,000 in the case of the Euro Notes and to below $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligations with respect to any Net Available Cash from an Asset Disposition by making an Asset Disposition Offer with respect to such Net Available Cash prior to the time period that may be required by the Indenture with respect to all or a part of the available Net Available Cash (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture (an “Advance Offer”). ----- To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) for general corporate purposes, to the extent not prohibited by the other covenants contained in the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euros, such Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero, and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Available Cash the Issuer is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement or such shorter period of time required to comply with Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the Asset Disposition Offer (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”).

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a _pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness_ or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and, in the case of the Notes, in minimum denominations of €100,000 principal amount and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof, in the case of the Euro Notes and $200,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof in the case of the Dollar Notes. The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Issuer or the Paying Agents, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five (5) Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will, via an authenticating agent, authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of €100,000, in the case of the Euro Notes and $200,000 in the case of the Dollar Notes. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book-entry) by the Issuer to the Holder thereof. For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be cash: (1) the assumption by the transferee (or other extinguishment in connection with the transactions relating to such Asset Dispositions) of Indebtedness and any other liabilities (as recorded on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or in the footnotes thereto, or if incurred or accrued subsequent to the date of such balance sheet, such liabilities that would have been reflected on the Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or in the footnotes thereof if such incurrence or accrual had taken place on or prior to the date of such balance sheet, as determined in good faith by the Issuer) of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Guarantor) and the ----- release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition, to the extent of the cash received; (3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary (as applicable) are released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition; (4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Indebtedness) received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; and (5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated NonCash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of €1,020 million and 25% of L2QA Pro Forma EBITDA (with the fair market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received or, at the Issuer’s option, at the time of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition, and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value). The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the Indenture.

However, a default under clauses (3), (5), (7), (8) or (9) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (5), (7), (8) and (9) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time specified in clauses (3), (5), (7), (8) or (9), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may and, if directed by holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, the Trustee shall, declare all such Notes to be due and payable immediately. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Default or Event of Default (other than a payment default) unless a written notice of any event which is in fact such a default is received by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and such notice references the Notes and the Indenture. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness, or the relevant Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (i) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (ii) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived. Holders of the Notes may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, indemnity and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee, and the Trustee has received, security and/or indemnity (including by way of pre-funding) reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and ----- (5) the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60day period. Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee (on behalf of the Holders) or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee (on behalf of the Holders). The Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee is aware, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. Such Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security (including by way of pre-funding) satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and a Responsible Officer of the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. With respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists,” “is continuing” or similar expressions with respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived. If any Default or Event of Default occurs due to (a) the failure by any person to take any action by a specified time, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have been cured at the time, if any, that the applicable person takes such action or (b) the taking of any action by any person that is not then permitted by the terms of the Indenture or any other Notes Document, such Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to be cured on the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such action would be permitted at such time to be taken under the Indenture and the other Notes Documents and (ii) the date on which such action is unwound or otherwise modified to the extent necessary for such revised action to be permitted at such time by the Indenture and the other Notes Documents. If any Default or Event of Default occurs that is subsequently cured (a “Cured Default”), any other subsequent Default or Event of Default resulting from the taking or omitting to take any action by any person, which subsequent Default or Event of Default would not have arisen had the Cured Default not occurred, shall be deemed to be cured automatically upon, and simultaneously with, the cure of the Cured Default. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph, a Default or Event of Default (the “Initial Default”) may not be cured pursuant to this paragraph: (a) in the case of an Initial Default described in clause (b) of the second sentence of this paragraph, if an Officer of the Issuer had Knowledge at the time of taking any such action that such Initial Default had occurred and was continuing; or (b) if the Trustee shall have declared all the Notes to be due and payable immediately pursuant to the provisions described under “Events of Default” prior to the date such Initial Default would have been deemed to be cured under this paragraph. For purposes of the paragraph above, “Knowledge” shall mean, with respect to an Officer of the Issuer, (i) the actual knowledge of such individual or (ii) the knowledge that such individual would have obtained if such individual had acted in good faith to discharge his or her duties with the same level of diligence and care as would reasonably be expected from an officer in a substantially similar position. Without limiting the foregoing, the Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with an Initial Default then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any ----- other provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture. The Notes will provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but only if the Trustee is indemnified and/or secured (including by way of pre-funding) to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action, notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it, and it will be for Holders of such Notes to take action directly.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

During the existence of an Event of Default of which the Trustee has been notified in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The Issuer shall deliver written notice to the Trustee within thirty (30) days of becoming aware of the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default. The Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee and the Paying Agents and the Registrars will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries. Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee. The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification and/or security of the Trustee by the Issuer and the Guarantors for any loss, liability, taxes or expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

In addition, for so long as any of the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules and regulations of the Exchange so require, notices with respect to such Notes will be published as required by such rules. Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it. For Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. ----- Prescription Claims against the Issuer or any Guarantor for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.

If that euro amount or U.S. dollar amount is less than the euro amount or U.S. dollar amount, as applicable, expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint or several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note, any Note Guarantee or to the Trustee.

We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agents, the Registrars and the Transfer ----- Agents nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or procedures. DTC has advised the Issuer that it is: - a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law, - a “banking organization” within the meaning of New York Banking Law, - a member of the Federal Reserve System, - a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and - a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provision of Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (that DTC’s direct participants deposit with DTC). DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among direct participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic book-entry transfers and pledges between direct participants’ accounts. DTC is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. Like DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organizations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic bookentry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,124,DESCRIPTION OF NOTES,124.32,Global Clearance and Settlement Under the Book-Entry System,124.32.1,,"The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange and to trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will therefore be required by DTC to be settled in immediately available funds. The Issuer expects that secondary trading in any certificated Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. Subject to compliance with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross market transfers between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream by its common depositary, however, such cross market transactions will require delivery of instructions to Euroclear or Clearstream by the counterparty in such system in accordance with the rules and regulations and within the established deadlines of such system (Brussels time). Euroclear or Clearstream will, if the transaction meets its settlement requirements, deliver instructions to the common depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving interests in the Global Notes by DTC, and making and receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement application to DTC. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to the common depositary. ----- Because of the time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day (which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC, will be received with value on the settlement date of DTC, but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date. Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, as the case may be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified at any time. Neither the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrars, the Transfer Agents nor the Paying Agents will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

We expect that secondary trading in the Notes will also be settled in immediately available funds. The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in same-day funds.

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or non-participating interests made to Luxembourg non-resident holders of the Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid non-participating interests in respect of the Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg non-resident holders. (ii) Resident Noteholders Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of December 23, 2005, as amended (the “December Law”), mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest made to Luxembourg resident holder of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Notes nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes held by Luxembourg resident Noteholders. Under the December Law, payments of interest or similar income made by a paying agent (within the meaning of the December Law) established in Luxembourg to or for the benefit of an individual Luxembourg resident Investor may be subject to a final tax of 20%. Such tax will be in full discharge of income tax if the individual beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of the management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding and payment of the tax will be assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. An individual beneficial owner of interest or similar income (within the meaning of the December Law) who is a resident of Luxembourg may opt in accordance with the December Law to self declare and pay a final tax of 20% when he/she receives such interest or similar income from a paying agent established in another Member State or in a member state of the EEA which is not a Member State. In such case, the 20% levy is calculated on the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agent. The option for the 20% final levy must cover all payments of interest or similar income made by all the non-resident paying agents to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during the entire civil year. The individual resident who is the beneficial owner of interest is responsible for the declaration and the payment of the 20% final tax. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

If such payments are made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article 238-0 A of the FTC, a 75% withholding tax will apply (subject to certain exceptions and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). The 75% withholding tax set forth under Article 125 A III of the FTC is applicable irrespective of the location of the tax domicile or registered headquarters of the holders of the Notes. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order (arrêté), which may be updated at any time and at least once a year. Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the FTC, interest and assimilated revenues on the Notes will not be deductible from the Issuer’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid on an account opened in a financial institution established in such a NonCooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest or other revenues may be recharacterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Article 109 et seq. of the FTC, in which case such non-deductible interest and other assimilated revenues may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC, at a rate of (i) 12.8% for payments benefiting individuals who are not French tax residents, (ii) 28% (such rate will be lowered to 26,5% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2021 and to 25% for fiscal years beginning as from January 1, 2022 in order to be aligned on the French standard corporate income tax rate) for payments benefiting legal persons who are not French tax residents or (iii) 75% for payments made outside France in a Non-Cooperative State other than those mentioned in 2° of 2 bis of Article ----- 238-0 A of the FTC (subject to certain exceptions and to the more favourable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the 75% withholding tax provided by Article 125 A III of the FTC, nor, to the extent the relevant interest and other revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, the Deductibility Exclusion and the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC which may be levied as a consequence of such Deductibility Exclusion, will apply in respect of the Notes, provided that the Issuer can prove that the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes is not to enable payments of interest or other revenues to be made in a Non-Cooperative State (the “Exception”). Pursuant to the guidelines published by the French tax authorities (BOI-INT-DG-20-50, n°550 and 990 dated February 11, 2014 - the “Administrative Guidelines”), the Notes should benefit from the Exception without the Issuer having to provide any evidence supporting the main purpose and effect of the issue of the Notes, if such Notes are: - offered by means of a public offering within the meaning of Article L.411-1 of the French Code _monétaire et financier (French Monetary and Financial Code) for which the publication of a_ prospectus is mandatory or pursuant to an equivalent offer in a State other than a NonCooperative State (for this purpose, an “equivalent offering” means any offering requiring the registration or submission of an offering document by or with a foreign securities market authority); and/or - admitted to trading on a French or foreign regulated market or on a multilateral financial instruments trading facility, provided that such market or facility is not located in an NonCooperative State and that such market is operated by a market operator, an investment services provider, or by such other similar foreign entity that is not located in a Non-Cooperative State; and/or - admitted, at the time of their issuance, to the operations of a central depositary or of a securities delivery and payment systems operator within the meaning of Article L.561-2 of the French _Code monétaire et financier, or of one or more similar foreign depositaries or operators,_ provided that such depositary or operator is not located in a Non-Cooperative State. Considering that the Notes should be cleared through a qualifying clearing system at the time of their issue, one may consider that they should fall under the Exception. Consequently, any potential payments made by the Issuer in respect of the Notes to their holders should benefit from the Exception, and therefore should be exempt from the withholding tax set out under Article 125 A III of the FTC. Moreover, under the same conditions and to the extent that the relevant interest and other revenues relate to genuine transactions and are not in an abnormal or exaggerated amount, interest and other revenues paid by the Issuer to the holders of the Notes in respect of the Notes will not be subject, pursuant to the Administrative Guidelines, to the Deductibility Exclusion and, as a result, will not be subject to the withholding tax set forth under Article 119 bis, 2 of the FTC.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

This description only applies to Notes held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and does not address, except as set forth below, aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be applicable to holders that are subject to special tax rules, such as: - banks or other financial institutions; - insurance companies; - real estate investment trusts; - individual retirement accounts or other tax deferred accounts; - regulated investment companies; - grantor trusts; - tax-exempt organizations; - persons that will own the Notes through partnerships or other pass-through entities; - dealers or traders in securities or currencies; - U.S. Holders that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar; - certain former citizens and long-term residents of the United States; - U.S. Holders that use a mark-to-market method of accounting; or - U.S. Holders that will hold a Note as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion or integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, this description does not address the 3.8% Medicare tax on net investment income, the U.S. federal estate and gift tax or the alternative minimum tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes and does not address the U.S. federal income tax treatment of holders that do not acquire the Notes as part of the initial offering at their initial issue price (generally, in each case, the first price to the public at which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold for money). Each prospective purchaser should consult its own tax advisor with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of acquiring, owning and disposing of the Notes. This description is based on the Code, U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative pronouncements and judicial decisions, each as available and in effect on the date hereof. All of the foregoing is subject to change or differing interpretations, possibly with retroactive effect, which could affect the tax considerations described herein. No opinion of counsel to the Issuer or the holders or ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has been or will be given with respect to any of the considerations discussed herein. No assurances can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position different from any of the tax considerations discussed below. For purposes of this description, a U.S. Holder is a beneficial owner of the Notes who for U.S. federal income tax purposes is: ----- - a citizen or individual resident of the United States; - a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) organized in or under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, including the District of Columbia; - an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or - a trust (1) that has validly elected to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes or (2) (a) the administration over which a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision and (b) all of the substantial decisions of which one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control. If an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Notes, the tax treatment of the partnership and a partner in such partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.

The Issuer believes, and intends to take the position, if required, that the Notes should not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments because of, among other things, the possibility of such payments or redemptions. This position is based in part on assumptions, as of the date of issuance of the Notes, (1) regarding the likelihood that such payments or redemptions will have to be paid or that the Issuer will elect to pay such amounts and/or (2) relating to the expected yield to maturity of the Notes.

The IRS, however, may take a position contrary to the Issuer’s position, which could affect the amount, timing and character of a U.S. Holder’s income with respect to the Notes.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,125,CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS,125.6,Stated Interest,125.6.1,,"Stated interest paid on the Notes generally will be treated as “qualified stated interest.” Payments of qualified stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as ordinary interest income at the time it is received or accrued, depending on the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as detailed below. The term “qualified stated interest” generally means stated interest that is unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the Issuer), or that is treated as constructively received, at least annually at a single fixed rate. In the case of the Euro Notes, stated interest will be included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income in an amount equal to the U.S. dollar value of the euros, including the amount of any withholding tax thereon, regardless of whether the euros are converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the cash method of tax accounting will determine such U.S. dollar value using the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt. A cash method U.S. Holder generally will not realize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of the interest payment but may have ----- foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the actual disposition of the euros received. Generally, a U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of tax accounting will determine the U.S. dollar value of accrued interest income using the average rate of exchange for the accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within each taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. Holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the portion of the accrual period within each taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period) or the spot rate on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. Holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for tax purposes will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an interest payment if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate used in translating the accrual of that interest. The amount of foreign currency gain or loss to be recognized by such U.S. Holder will be an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the euro interest payment (determined on the basis of the spot rate on the date the interest income is received) in respect of the accrual period and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as determined above) regardless of whether the payment is converted to U.S. dollars. This foreign currency gain or loss will be ordinary income or loss and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will be U.S. source provided that the residence of a taxpayer is considered to be the United States for purposes of the rules regarding foreign currency gain or loss. Interest (including original issue discount (“OID”), if any, as described below) included in a U.S. Holder’s gross income with respect to the Notes will be treated as foreign source income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The limitation on non-U.S. taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific “baskets” of income. For this purpose, interest generally should constitute “passive category income.” Any non-U.S. withholding tax paid by a U.S. Holder at the rate applicable to the U.S. Holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of foreign tax credits.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,125,CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS,125.7,Original Issue Discount,125.7.1,,"One or more series of the Notes may be treated as issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A Note will be treated as having been issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes if its “stated redemption price at maturity” exceeds its issue price by at least the “OID de minimis amount.” The OID de minimis amount equals 1/4 of 1% of the debt instrument’s stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the number of complete years from its issue date to maturity. The “stated redemption price at maturity” of a Note is the sum of all payments required to be made on the Note other than qualified stated interest payments. If a Note is issued with OID, a U.S. Holder generally will be required to include OID in income before the receipt of the associated cash payment, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s accounting method for tax purposes. The amount of OID with respect to a Note that a U.S. Holder must include in income is the sum of the “daily portions” of the OID for the Note for each day during the taxable year (or portion of the taxable year) in which the U.S. Holder held the Note. The daily portion is determined by allocating a pro rata portion of the OID for each day of the accrual period. An accrual period may be of any length and the accrual periods may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first day of an accrual period or on the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to an accrual period is equal to the excess of (1) the product of the “adjusted issue price” of the Note at the beginning of the accrual period and its yield to maturity (computed on a constant yield method and compounded at the end of each accrual period, taking into account the length of the particular accrual period) over (2) the amount of any stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is generally the sum of the issue price of the Note plus the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods reduced by any payments on the Note that were not stated interest. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder generally will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity (other than a payment of qualified stated interest) and the “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the period. Under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, a U.S. Holder of a Note with OID may elect to include in gross income all interest (including stated interest) that accrues on the Note using the constant yield method ----- described above. Once made with respect to the Note, the election cannot be revoked without the consent of the IRS. A U.S. Holder considering an election under these rules should consult its own tax advisor. U.S. Holders may obtain information regarding the amount of OID, if any, the issue price, the issue date and yield to maturity by contacting the Issuer, c/o Altice France S.A., 16, rue du General Alain de Boissieu, 75015 Paris, France, Attn: Chief Financial Officer. Any OID on a Euro Note generally will be determined for any accrual period in euros and then translated into U.S. dollars in the same manner as stated interest accrued by an accrual basis U.S. Holder. Upon receipt of an amount attributable to OID (whether in connection with a sale or disposition of such a Note or otherwise), a U.S. Holder generally will recognize foreign currency gain or loss in an amount determined in the same manner as stated interest received by an accrual basis U.S. Holder, as described above. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the interplay between the application of the OID and foreign currency exchange gain or loss rules. For these purposes, all receipts on a Euro Note will be viewed first, as payments of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earlier accrual periods first; and, third, as receipts of principal. The rules regarding OID are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to their particular situations.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost increased by the amount of any OID previously included in income and decreased by payments other than stated interest made with respect to the Note. If a U.S. Holder purchases a Note with euros, the U.S. dollar cost of the Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. The amount realized upon the disposition of a Note generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the amount received on the date of the disposition calculated at the spot rate of exchange on that date. However, if the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis U.S. Holder (and, if it so elects, an accrual basis U.S. Holder) should determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of or amount received on the Note, as applicable, by translating the amount paid or received at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase or disposition, as applicable. The election available to accrual basis U.S. Holders in respect of the purchase and disposition of Notes traded on an established securities market must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, in the case of Euro Notes, any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement, or other taxable disposition of a Note will be capital gain or loss, and will be longterm capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year as of the date of disposition. Long-term capital gain of a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally is taxed at preferential rates. The ability of a U.S. Holder to offset capital losses against ordinary income is limited. Any gain or loss recognized on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be treated as income from sources within the United States or loss allocable to income from sources within the United States. In the case of a Euro Note, any gain or loss recognized by a U.S. Holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Euro Note generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period in which the U.S. Holder held such Note. Such foreign currency gain or loss will equal the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. Holder’s euro purchase price for the Note calculated at the spot rate of exchange on the date of purchase of the Note. The realization of any foreign currency gain or loss, including foreign currency gain or loss with respect to amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest and any OID, will be limited to the amount of overall gain or loss realized on the disposition of the Euro Notes. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The payor will be required to withhold backup withholding tax on payments made within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman (and certain subsidiaries thereof), on a Note to, or from gross proceeds on the sale or disposition of a Note paid to, a U.S. Holder, other than an exempt recipient, if the holder fails to furnish its correct taxpayer identification number or otherwise fails to comply with, or establish an exemption from, the backup withholding requirements. Payments within the United States, or by a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman (and certain subsidiaries thereof), of principal and interest (including OID, if any) and proceeds of a sale, exchange, retirement or disposition to a holder of a Note that is not a U.S. person generally are subject to information reporting, but will not be subject to backup withholding tax if an appropriate certification is timely provided by the holder to the payor and the payor does not have actual knowledge or a reason to know that the certificate is incorrect. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information in a timely manner. Certain U.S. Holders are required to report information relating to an interest in the Notes, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Notes held in custodial accounts maintained by certain financial institutions).

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,125,CERTAIN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN CONSIDERATIONS,125.12,,125.12.1,,"The U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), imposes certain fiduciary standards and certain other requirements on employee benefit plans subject to ERISA and entities whose underlying assets are treated as “plan assets” within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 (as modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA) of such employee benefit plans (collectively, “ERISA Plans”), and on those persons who are fiduciaries with respect to ERISA Plans. Investments by ERISA Plans are subject to ERISA’s general fiduciary requirements, including the requirement of investment prudence and diversification and the requirement that an ERISA Plan’s investments be made in accordance with the documents governing the ERISA Plan. The prudence of a particular investment should be determined by the responsible fiduciary of an ERISA Plan by taking into account the ERISA Plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment, including, but not limited to, the matters discussed above under “Risk Factors” and the fact that in the future there may be no market in which such fiduciary will be able to sell or otherwise dispose of the Notes or any interest therein. Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), prohibit certain transactions involving the assets of an ERISA Plan, as well as those plans that are not subject to ERISA but which are subject to Section 4975 of the Code, such as individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, including entities whose underlying assets are treated as “plan assets” of such plans, accounts or arrangements (together with ERISA Plans, “Plans”), and certain persons (referred to as “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code) having certain relationships to Plans, unless a statutory or administrative exemption is applicable to the transaction. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes or other liabilities under ERISA and the Code, and the transaction may have to be rescinded. In addition, the fiduciary of the Plan that engaged in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. Governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA), while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (“Similar Laws”). Each Plan should consider the fact that none of us, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustee and certain other parties to this offering memorandum, or their respective affiliates (the “Transaction Parties”) is undertaking to act, or will undertake to act, as a fiduciary to any Plan with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the Notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the Notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the Notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the Notes for any specific purchaser. The decision to purchase and hold the Notes must be made solely by each prospective Plan purchaser on an arm’s length basis. Accordingly, the Notes may not be purchased using the assets of any Plan if any Transaction Party is the sponsor of or fiduciary to such Plan. In addition, if the Notes (or any interest therein) are acquired by a Plan with respect to which any Transaction Party is a party in interest or a disqualified person, such transaction could be deemed to be a direct or indirect prohibited transaction within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. Moreover, the acquisition or holding of the Notes or other indebtedness issued by the Issuer by or on behalf of a party in interest or disqualified person with respect to a Plan that owns or acquires an equity interest in the Issuer also could give rise to a prohibited transaction. Certain exemptions from the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code could be applicable, however, to a Plan’s acquisition of a Note. Included among these exemptions are Prohibited Transaction Exemption (“PTE”) 84–14, regarding transactions effected by an independent “qualified professional asset manager”; PTE 90–1, regarding investments by insurance company pooled separate accounts; PTE 91–38, regarding investments by bank collective investment funds; PTE 95–60, regarding investments by insurance company general accounts; and PTE 96–23, regarding investments by certain “in-house asset managers”. In addition to the class exemptions listed above, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory prohibited transaction exemption for transactions between a Plan and a person or entity that is a party in interest to such Plan solely by reason of providing services to the Plan (other than a party in interest that is, or is an affiliate of, a ----- fiduciary that has or exercises discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice with respect to the assets of the Plan involved in the transaction), provided that the Plan receives no less and pays no more than “adequate consideration” (within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(f)(10) of the Code) in connection with the transaction. Even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of the relief provided by these exemptions might not cover all acts which might be construed as prohibited transactions. Thus, the fiduciary of a Plan that is considering acquiring and holding the Notes in reliance on any of these PTEs, or any other PTEs, should carefully review the conditions and limitations of the PTE and consult with their counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no, and we do not provide any, assurance that any PTE or any other exemption will be available with respect to any particular transaction involving the Notes. EACH ACQUIRER AND EACH TRANSFEREE OF A NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN WILL BE DEEMED TO REPRESENT, WARRANT AND AGREE, AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THAT IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN, THAT (1) EITHER (A) IT IS NOT, AND IS NOT ACTING ON BEHALF OF (AND FOR SO LONG AS IT HOLDS SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN IT WILL NOT BE, AND WILL NOT BE ACTING ON BEHALF OF), A BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3(42) OF ERISA) OR A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN WHICH IS SUBJECT TO ANY SIMILAR LAWS AND NO PART OF THE ASSETS USED BY IT TO ACQUIRE OR HOLD SUCH NOTE OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN CONSTITUTES THE ASSETS OF ANY BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR OR SUCH A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, OR (B) ITS ACQUISITION, HOLDING AND DISPOSITION OF SUCH NOTES OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN DOES NOT AND WILL NOT CONSTITUTE OR RESULT IN A NON-EXEMPT PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406 OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE (OR, IN THE CASE OF A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, A VIOLATION OF ANY SIMILAR LAWS); AND (2) NEITHER THE ISSUER NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES IS UNDERTAKING TO ACT AS A “FIDUCIARY” (WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 3(21) OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE OR, WITH RESPECT TO A GOVERNMENTAL, CHURCH OR NON-U.S. PLAN, ANY DEFINITION OF “FIDUCIARY” UNDER SIMILAR LAWS) WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASER OR HOLDER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY PURCHASE OR HOLDING OF THE NOTES, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY EXERCISE BY THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OF ANY RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTES, AND NO ADVICE PROVIDED BY THE ISSUER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES HAS FORMED A PRIMARY BASIS FOR ANY INVESTMENT DECISION BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE PURCHASER OR HOLDER IN CONNECTION WITH THE NOTES AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED WITH RESPECT TO THE NOTES. WE, THE INITIAL PURCHASERS AND THE TRUSTEE, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONCLUSIVELY RELY UPON THE TRUTH AND ACCURACY OF THE FOREGOING REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS BY ACQUIRERS AND TRANSFEREES OF ANY NOTES (OR ANY INTEREST THEREIN) WITHOUT FURTHER INQUIRY. A fiduciary of a Plan or other plan that is subject to Similar Laws, prior to investing in the Notes or any interest therein, should take into account, among other considerations, whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment; the composition of the plan’s portfolio with respect to diversification by type of asset; the plan’s funding objectives; the tax effects of the investment; and whether, under the general fiduciary standards of ERISA or other applicable laws, including investment prudence and diversification, an investment in the Notes or any interest therein is appropriate for the plan, taking into account the plan’s particular circumstances and all of the facts and circumstances of the investment, including such matters as the overall investment policy of the plan and the composition of the plan’s investment portfolio. The sale of any Note or any interest therein to a Plan or a plan that is subject to any Similar Laws is in no respect a representation by any Transaction Party that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by such plans generally or any particular plan; that the prohibited transaction exemptions described above, or any other prohibited transaction exemption, would apply to such an investment by such plans generally or any particular plan; or that such an investment is appropriate for such plans generally or any particular plan. The discussion of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code contained in this Offering Memorandum, is, of necessity, general, and does not purport to be complete. Moreover, the provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. Therefore, the ----- matters discussed above may be affected by future regulations, rulings and court decisions, some of which may have retroactive application and effect. Any Plan or other plan that is subject to Similar Laws, and any fiduciary thereof, proposing to invest in the Notes or any interest therein should consult with its legal advisors regarding the applicability of the fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws, to such investment, and to confirm that such investment will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of any applicable requirement of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code or Similar Laws. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Even if payments on the Notes are treated as paid from a foreign financial institution and any portion of such payments is treated as a “foreign passthru payment,” the Notes will be grandfathered because no final regulations defining a “foreign passthru payment” have been issued and therefore the Notes are not subject to the FATCA withholding rules. If, however, the Notes are modified at a time when the grandfathering rules are no longer available, withholding may apply and holders and beneficial owners of the Notes will not be entitled to receive any additional amounts to compensate them for any such withholding. ----- Grandfathering will not apply to the Notes to the extent the Notes are modified more than six months after the date on which final regulations defining a “foreign passthru payment” are published, although FATCA withholding would not apply until two years from such date of publication. In addition, if additional Notes are issued after the expiration of the grandfathering period and have the same ISIN or CUSIP as the Notes issued hereby, then withholding agents may treat all notes, including the Notes issued hereby, as subject to withholding under FATCA. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of a refund in that circumstance. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and a foreign country where the Issuer, a holder or intermediary is located may modify the requirements in this paragraph. Prospective holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the Notes. The above description is not intended to constitute a complete analysis of all tax consequences relating to the acquisition, ownership and disposition of the Notes.

Until the expiry of the 40-day Period, an offer or sale within the United States of Notes initially sold in reliance on Regulation S by a dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration requirements for the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by Regulation. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see “Notice to Investors”. The Initial Purchasers have also agreed that they will not at any time offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any securities under circumstances in which such offer, sale, pledge, contract or disposition would cause the exemption afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the U.S. Securities Act or the safe harbors of Rule 144A and Regulation S to cease to be applicable to the offer and sale of the Notes. The Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors”. The Issuer will apply for the Notes to be admitted to listing and to trading on The International Stock Exchange, however, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Notes—The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Official List _of The International Stock Exchange”. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market_ in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The Initial Purchasers may discontinue any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. In addition, such market making activities will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid ----- trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favorable. You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and other charges in connection with purchases of securities. Each Initial Purchaser has also agreed in the Purchase Agreement that it will (to the best of its knowledge and belief) comply with all applicable securities laws and regulations in force in any jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Notes or possesses or distributes this Offering Memorandum, and will obtain any consent, approval or permission required by it for the purchase, offer, sale or delivery by it of the Notes under the laws and regulations in force. In connection with the offering, the Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the Notes. The Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may also over allot the offering of the Notes, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilizing Managers are not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may enter into in the future investment banking, financial advisory and/or lending and commercial banking transactions with, and/or may perform other services for, to us and/or our affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees, commissions and reimbursement of expenses (including acting as initial purchasers and/or lenders in connection with previous issuances of debt securities and debt facilities of the Issuer and its affiliates). In connection with our strategy to review and evaluate selective acquisitions and other business combinations or strategic transactions, we and our shareholders regularly engage mergers and acquisition advisors and other financial advisors to assist us.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates have committed in full to a term loan credit agreement on a “certain funds” basis that will provide credit in an aggregate principal amount providing the Offeror sufficient funds to fund the Offer and pay related fees, costs and expenses. Depending on market conditions, the Initial Purchasers may decide to initially purchase and hold a portion of the Notes for their own account. We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be three business days (as such term is used for purposes ----- of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). Trades in the secondary market generally settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. Altice Europe, its controlling shareholder, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers may purchase Notes in the offering at a purchase price per Note equal to the issue price set forth on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum. The Purchase Agreement between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers will not restrict the ability of Altice Europe, its controlling shareholder, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers to buy or sell Notes in the future and, as a result, Altice Europe or its controlling shareholder, or any of their respective affiliates, directors or officers may buy or sell the Notes in open market transactions at any time following the consummation of the offering of the Notes. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (and/or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer and its affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. Affiliates of certain Initial Purchasers are agents and/or lenders under the Existing Term Loan Agreement. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are also lenders under the Corporate Financing Facility Agreement and/or the Existing Revolving Credit Facilities that are expected to be repaid with the proceeds of the Notes, and may therefore receive a portion of the proceeds of the Notes pursuant to the Transactions. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The determination of where a debtor has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the New Insolvency Regulation that a debtor has its center of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, Preamble 30 of the New Insolvency Regulation states that the center of main interests of a “debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis, which is therefore ascertainable by third parties”. The courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the center of main interests of a debtor, including in particular where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor’s creditors are established. A debtor’s center of main interests is not a static concept and may change from time to time but is determined for the purposes of deciding which courts have competent jurisdiction to commence insolvency proceedings at the time of the filing of the insolvency petition. If the center of main interests of a debtor is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the debtor under the New Insolvency Regulation would be commenced in such jurisdiction and accordingly a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to commence the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the New Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings commenced in one Member State under the New Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other EU Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be commenced in another Member State. If the center of main interests of a debtor is in a Member State (other than Denmark), under Article 3(2) of the New Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to commence secondary (territorial) insolvency proceedings against that debtor only if such debtor has an “establishment” (within the meaning and as defined in Article 2(10) of the New Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined to mean a place of operations where the debtor carries on non-transitory economic activity with human means and goods. Where main proceedings have been commenced in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests, any proceedings commenced subsequently in another Member State in which the debtor has an establishment (secondary proceedings) are limited to “winding up proceedings” listed in Annex A of the New Insolvency Regulation. The effects of those territorial proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its center of main interests have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (a) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s center of main interests is situated under that Member State’s law; or (b) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of a creditor which is domiciled, habitually resident or has its registered office in the other Member State or whose claim arises from the operation of the establishment. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the lex _fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency_ proceedings of the debtor. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary ----- proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency administrator appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s center of main interests is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations, as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Following the entry into force of the New Insolvency Regulation, there is an increased scrutiny in situations where there has been a recent COMI shift. Where a company’s COMI has shifted in the preceding three months the rebuttable presumption that its COMI is at the place of its registered office will no longer apply. Also, the opening of secondary proceedings in another Member State—which will no longer be limited only to “winding-up proceedings”—will be possible not only if the debtor has an establishment in such Member State at the time of the opening of main insolvency proceedings, but also if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request of opening of main insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Only a company that is facing any type of difficulties may petition the President of the competent,"commercial court for the appointment of an ad hoc agent (mandataire ad hoc). The order of the president of the court appointing a _mandataire ad hoc is notified for information purposes to the debtor’s auditors. The proceedings are not limited in time and the scope of work of the ad hoc agent is determined by the court. The ad hoc agent has no legal coercive power over the creditors. The restructuring agreement between the company and its main creditors will be negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis; those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the arrangement. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims but, in practice, those that have accepted to take part in the proceedings usually accept not to do so. If the negotiations are successful, the parties typically enter into a restructuring agreement which is confidential and not sanctioned by the commercial court although the agreement reached is reported to the president of the court. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition the relevant judge for a grace period, as set forth above. Conciliation Proceedings. May only be initiated by the debtor itself if it faces actual or foreseeable difficulties of a legal, economic or financial nature and is not insolvent, or has been insolvent for less than 45 days and (ii) experiences or anticipates legal, economic or financial difficulties. The proceedings may last up to four months (with the conciliateur being able to request a one month extension). As for the mandat ad hoc, the commercial court will appoint a third party (conciliateur) which has no coercive power, any agreement between the debtor and its creditors being negotiated on a purely consensual and voluntary basis: those creditors not willing to take part cannot be bound by the agreement nor forced to accept it. During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment of their claims but they usually accept not to do so. In addition, the debtor retains ----- the right to petition the judge which commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period, such decision being taken after hearing the _conciliateur. If the negotiations are successful, the parties typically enter into a conciliation agreement, which will be either acknowledged (constaté) by the president of the court or approved (homologué) by the court. It will then become binding upon them and the creditors party thereto, who may not take action against the company in respect of claims governed by the conciliation agreement. The acknowledgement of the conciliation agreement by the president of the court gives the conciliation agreement the legal force of a final judgment, which means that it constitutes a judicial title (titre exécutoire) that can be enforced by the parties without further recourse to a judge, but the conciliation proceedings remain confidential. The court can, at the request of the debtor, appoint the conciliateur to monitor the implementation of the agreement (mandataire à l’exécution de l’accord) during its execution. Additionally, pursuant to Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, the judge having commenced conciliation proceedings may, during the execution period of a conciliation agreement (whether it is acknowledged or approved as described above), impose grace periods on creditors who were asked to participate in the conciliation proceedings (other than the tax and social security administrations) and have formally put the debtor on notice to pay or are suing for payment of claims that were not dealt with in the conciliation agreement, such decision being taken after hearing the conciliator if he/she has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the agreement. Alternatively, the approval (homologation) by the court will make the conciliation proceedings, the existence of the conciliation agreement as well as the terms of the New Money Lien (see below) granted to creditors and the guarantees securing the same under the conciliation agreement public (the other terms of the conciliation agreement are not made public but the works council or employee representatives are informed of the content of the agreement) and otherwise have the same effect as its acknowledgement (constatation) as described above and, in addition: - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the commercial court may not determine that the date of insolvency, and therefore the starting date of the hardening period (as defined below) is earlier than the date of the approval of the restructuring agreement by the court (except in case of fraud); - creditors who, in the context of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money, goods or services for the purpose of ensuring the continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) may be granted a priority of payment over all pre-proceedings and post-proceedings claims (other than certain pre-proceedings employment claims and procedural costs) (the “New Money Lien”), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings; - in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings subsequent to conciliation proceedings, the payment date of claims secured by the New Money Lien may not be rescheduled without their holders’ consent, not even by the creditors’ committees (although the powers of the bondholders’ general meeting in this respect are the subject of debate); and - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is transmitted to its statutory auditors. Whether the conciliation agreement is acknowledged or approved, while it is in force: - interest accruing on the claims that are the subject of the agreement may not be compounded; - the debtor retains the right to petition the court that commenced the conciliation proceedings for a grace period pursuant to Article 1343-5 et seq. of the French Civil Code and Article L. 611-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (see “Grace periods” above), in relation to claims of creditors (other than public creditors) party to the conciliation proceedings that are not already subject to the conciliation agreement, in which case the decision would be taken after having heard the conciliateur (provided that the terms of his or her appointment included monitoring the implementation of the agreement, as referred to above); and ----- - an obligor or third party having guaranteed, or provided credit support with respect to, the obligations of the company whose conciliation agreement has been acknowledged or approved may rely on the provisions of such agreement. In the event of a breach of the conciliation agreement, any party to the conciliation agreement may petition the court for its termination. If such termination is granted, grace periods granted in relation to the conciliation proceedings may be revoked. Conversely, provided the conciliation agreement is duly performed, any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims dealt with by the conciliation agreement are suspended. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, except for amounts already paid to them. Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a majority of creditors large enough that it is likely that such draft plan would meet the threshold requirements for creditors consent in safeguard, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, as described below. Within the context of conciliation proceedings, the conciliator may organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession), at the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the conciliation proceedings have been consulted. Contractual provisions (i) modifying the conditions of continuation of a contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor due solely to the opening, or request made therefor, of a mandat ad hoc or a conciliation or (ii) requiring the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings are deemed null and void.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

A debtor which experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome may, in its sole discretion, initiate safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde), with respect to itself provided it (i) is not insolvent and (ii) experiences difficulties that it is not able to overcome (which does not require the company to demonstrate that these difficulties would be likely to lead to its insolvency if safeguard proceedings were not opened). Creditors of the company do not attend the hearing before the court at which the opening of safeguard proceedings is requested. Following the opening of safeguard proceedings, a court appointed administrator investigates the business of the company during an “observation period”, which may last up to six months, renewable for an additional six months with court approval and which can then be extended once again for an additional six months (i.e., a maximum duration of the proceedings of 18 months), and helps the company to draw up a draft safeguard plan (projet de plan de sauvegarde) which will be submitted to the creditors. Creditors do not have effective control of the proceedings, which remain in the hands of the company and the administrator and are overseen by the court. The administrator, pursuant to the terms of the judgment commencing the proceedings, exercises an after-the-fact control over the decisions made by the debtor (“mission de surveillance”) or assists the debtor to make all or some of the management decisions (“mission d’assistance”). During the safeguard proceedings, payments by the debtor of any debts incurred (i) prior to the commencement of the proceedings or (ii) after the commencement of the proceedings if not incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods delivered to the debtor, is are prohibited, subject to limited exceptions. For example, the bankruptcy judge may authorize payments for prior debts in order to discharge a lien on property needed for the continued operation of the business or to recover goods or rights transferred as collateral in a fiduciary estate (patrimoine fiduciaire). In addition, creditors are required to declare to the court-appointed creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) the debts that arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings (as well as the post-proceedings commencement non-privileged debts) and are prohibited from engaging individual lawsuits against the debtor for any payment default in relation to such debts (See “—Status of Creditors During In-Court Proceedings (Safeguard, Accelerated Safeguard _Proceedings, Accelerated Financial Safeguard, Judicial Reorganization or Judicial Liquidation”) and the accrual_ of interest on loans with a term of less than one year, or on payments deferred for less than one year, is stopped. Debts arising after the commencement of the safeguard proceedings and which relate to expenses necessary for the business’ ordinary activities during the observation period or are for the requirements of the proceedings, or are in consideration for a service rendered to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if such is not the case, they will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the ----- safeguard proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as the New Money Lien (See “—Conciliation _Proceedings”))._ The manner in which the liabilities will be settled as provided for in the plan (debt remissions and payment terms) must be submitted to the creditors during a consultation, or if rejected on an individual basis, prior to the plan being approved by the court. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the administrator, the creditors’ representative_ or the Public Prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings. In addition, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into (i) judicial reorganization proceedings (a) at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent or (b) in case no plan has been adopted by the relevant creditors’ committee and, if any, the bondholders’ general meeting (as described below), if the approval of a safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the company would shortly become insolvent should safeguard proceedings end or (ii) judicial liquidation proceedings at any time during the observation period if the debtor is insolvent and its recovery is manifestly impossible. In all such cases: (i) the court may decide at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor and in all such cases with the exception of (i)(b), the court may act upon its own initiative; and (ii) the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. Creditors must be consulted on the manner in which the debtor’s liabilities will be settled under the safeguard plan (debt forgiveness, payment terms or debt-for-equity-swaps) prior to the plan being approved by the court.

In such case, the administrator notifies the proposals for the settlement of debts to the court-appointed creditors’ representative, who obtains the agreement of each creditor who filed a claim, regarding the debt remissions and payment terms proposed. Creditors are consulted individually or collectively. French law does not state whether the debt settlement proposals can vary according to the creditor and whether the principle of equal treatment of creditors is applicable at this consultation stage. According to legal commentaries and established practice, differing treatment as between creditors is possible, provided that it is justified by the difference in situation of the creditors and approved by the court-appointed creditors’ representative. In practice, it is also possible at the consultation stage to make a proposal for a partial payment of claims over a shorter time period instead of a full payment of such claims over the maximum possible length of the plan (ten years). Creditors whose payment terms are not affected by the plan or who are paid in cash in full as soon as the plan is approved are not required to be consulted. Creditors which do not respond within 30 days of their receipt of the debt settlement proposal (other than debt for equity swaps) made to them are deemed to have accepted it. The creditors’ representative keeps a list of the responses from creditors, which is notified to the debtor, the court-appointed administrator and the controllers. Within the framework of a standard consultation, if the creditors refuse the proposals that were submitted to them, the court that approves the safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) can impose on them a uniform rescheduling of their claims (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien) over a maximum ----- period of ten years (except for claims with maturity dates of more than the deferral period set by the court, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same), but no waiver of any claim or debt-for-equity swap may be imposed without the relevant creditor’s individual acceptance.

Creditors which are members of the credit institutions committee or of the major suppliers committee may also prepare an alternative safeguard plan to the one prepared by the debtor with the assistance of the administrator that will also be put to the vote of the committees and of the general bondholders meeting, it being specified that approval of any such alternative plan is subject to the same two-thirds majority vote in each committee and in the bondholders general meeting and gives rise to a report by the administrator. Bondholders are not permitted to present their own alternative plan. The committees must announce whether they approve or reject the safeguard plan within a minimum of 15 days of its proposal. Such approval occurs when members of each committee voting in favor of the plan account for at least two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the creditors expressing a vote. Each committee votes on a euro-foreuro basis whether or not claims are subordinated and/or secured/unsecured. If there are any bondholders, they will be grouped together (whether or not they are subordinated, secured or unsecured) and, following approval of the plan by the two creditors committees, be required to vote on the plan during a general meeting of all bondholders (even if they relate to different issues and regardless of the law applicable to each issue) held for that purpose and approve the plan with a majority vote of two-thirds of the outstanding claims of the bondholders expressing a vote. Approval of the plan by the two-thirds majorities shall, if the plan is approved by the court, bind all the members of the committees and the bondholders (including those who abstained or voted against the adoption of the plan). The plan submitted to the committees and the bondholders, if any, must take into consideration subordination agreements entered into between creditors before commencement of the proceedings, may include the rescheduling or cancellation of debts, and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent) and may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation. Each creditor member of a creditors committee and each bondholder must, if applicable, inform the judicial administrator of the existence of any agreement relating to the exercise of its vote or to the full or total payment of its claim as well as of any subordination agreement. The judicial administrator shall then submit to the creditor or bondholder a proposal for the computation of its voting rights in the creditors committee or bondholders general meeting. In the event of a disagreement, the creditor or noteholder or the judicial administrator may request that the matter be decided by the president of the commercial court in summary proceedings. Amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) created by the debtor to secure certain creditors are not taken into account. In addition, creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their payment schedules or provides for a complete reimbursement in cash of their claims as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted are not entitled to vote on the plan. ----- Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees, the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders general meeting at the same two-thirds majority vote. Following approval by the creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting, and determination of the rescheduling of the claims of creditors that are not members of the committees or bondholders (see below), the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the court. The court must verify that the interests of all creditors are “sufficiently protected” and that required shareholder consent (if applicable) has been obtained. Creditors outside the creditors’ committees or the bondholders general meeting are consulted in accordance with the standard consultation process referred to above. If no plan is adopted by the committees within the first six-month period (either because they do not vote on the plan or because they reject it), this six-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the administrator for a period not exceeding the duration of the observation period, in order for the plan to be approved through the committee-based consultation process. Absent such extension, the court can still adopt a safeguard plan within the time remaining until the end of the observation period. In such a case, the rules are the same as the ones applicable for the standard consultation process described above. If the court empowers the court-appointed administrator to convene a shareholders’ meeting in order to take corporate resolutions with respect to the modification of the debtor’s by-laws (including modifications of its share capital) required by a safeguard plan, the court may order that, under certain conditions, the shareholders’ decisions be adopted by a majority vote of the shareholders attending or represented, as long as such shareholders own at least half of the shares with voting rights. If no proposed safeguard plan whatsoever is adopted by the committees the court may, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator, the mandataire judiciaire or the public prosecutor, convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings if it appears that the adoption of a safeguard plan is impossible and if the end of the safeguard proceedings would certainly rapidly lead to the company becoming insolvent. _Specific case—Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security_ and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted by a private economic operator placed in the same position, under normal market conditions. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors are consulted under specific conditions, within the framework of a commission where the heads of finance departments and the organizations and institutions concerned are represented. The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties and fees. In the event that safeguard (or judicial reorganization) proceedings are opened against the Issuer, the holders of the Notes will be treated as bondholders of the Issuer and will take part in the general meeting of bondholders, if any. Therefore, the bondholders would not be members of the credit institutions’ committee but would vote on any draft plan proposed by the Issuer as members of the general meeting of bondholders. Bondholders could, as members of the general meeting of bondholders, veto such plan if they reach a blocking majority (i.e., if their claims represent more than one third of the claims of those creditors casting a vote in the meeting). As a general matter, only the legal owner of the bank debt claim or the bond claim (as applicable) will be invited into the credit institutions committee or the general meeting of bondholders, as the case may be. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the credit institutions committee or the general meeting of bondholders (as applicable).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

To be eligible to accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfil the following conditions: - the debtor must not have been insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially applies for commencement of conciliation proceedings; - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the commencement of the proceedings; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties which it is not in a position to overcome; and - the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan ensuring the continuation of its business as a going concern which is supported by enough of its creditors involved in the proceedings to render likely its adoption by the relevant committees (credit institutions’ committee only for financial accelerated safeguard proceedings) and bondholders general meeting, if any, within a maximum of three months following the commencement of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within a maximum of two months following the commencement of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The regime applicable to standard safeguard proceedings regime is broadly applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing, since the total duration of accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months and the duration of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is only one month (unless the court decides to extend it by an additional month). In particular, the creditors committees and the bondholders general meeting are required to vote on the proposed safeguard plan within a minimum period of 15 days of its being notified to them in the case of accelerated safeguard proceedings, or within eight days in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings. The plan in the context of accelerated safeguard proceedings or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is adopted following the same majority rules as in standard safeguard proceedings and may notably provide for rescheduling, debt cancellation and conversion of debt into equity capital of the debtor (debt-for-equity swaps requiring relevant shareholder consent).If a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable deadline, the court is obligated to terminate the proceedings. The court cannot reschedule amounts owed to the creditors outside of the committee process. The list of claims of creditors party to the conciliation proceedings certified by the statutory auditor shall be deemed to constitute the filing of such claims for the purpose of accelerated safeguard proceedings or, as applicable, accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (see below) unless the creditors otherwise elect to make such a filing (see below). -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The company is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings (or for conciliation proceedings as discussed above) within 45 days of becoming insolvent. If it does not do so, de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers are exposed to civil liability. Where the debtor requested the commencement of judicial reorganization proceedings and the court, after having heard the debtor, considers that judicial liquidation proceedings would be more appropriate, it may order the commencement of the proceedings which it determines to be most appropriate. The same would apply if the debtor requested the commencement of judicial liquidation proceedings and the court considered that judicial reorganization proceedings would be more appropriate. In addition, at any time during the safeguard proceedings observation period, upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the State prosecutor, the court may convert safeguard proceedings into reorganization proceedings or liquidation proceedings if it appears that the debtor was already insolvent at the time of the court decision opening the proceedings. In all cases, the court’s decision is only taken after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, the State prosecutor and the workers’ representatives (if any). The objectives of judicial reorganization proceedings are the sustainability of the business, the preservation of employment and the payment of creditors, in that order. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, an administrator (administrateur judiciaire) is usually appointed by the court to investigate the business of the debtor during an observation period, which may last up to 18 months, and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by helping the debtor elaborate a draft judicial reorganization plan which is similar to a safeguard plan), or the sale of the business or the liquidation of debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation, especially with respect to committees of creditors, the bondholders general meeting and the powers of the court adopting the judicial reorganization plan (plan de _redressement) in the event of rejection by the creditors of proposals made to them, are the same (see above). At_ any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the State prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In reorganization proceedings, in case the shareholders’ minimum equity has not been restored to the minimum amount required by law in accordance with Article L.626 3 of the French Commercial Code, the administrator may appoint an administrator (mandataire de justice) in charge of convening an extraordinary meeting of shareholders and voting on the same on behalf of the shareholders opposed to such restoration provided that the draft restructuring plan provides for a modification of the equity reduction in favor of one or more third party(ies) undertaking to comply with such plan. In judicial reorganization proceedings if (i) the company has at least 150 employees, or if it controls within the meaning of the French Labor Code one or more companies having together at least 150 employees, (ii) its disappearance is likely to cause serious harm to the national or regional economy and (iii) the modification of its share capital seems to be the only credible way to avoid such harm and allow the continued operation of the business as a going concern, after (a) review of the options for a total or partial sale of the business and at the request of the court-appointed administrator or of the State prosecutor and (b) at least three months have elapsed as from the court decision commencing the proceedings, provided that the shareholders meetings required to approve the modification of the company’s share capital required for adoption of the reorganization plan have refused such modification, the insolvency court may either; ----- - appoint a court officer (mandataire) in order to convene the shareholders meeting and vote the share capital increase in lieu of the shareholders having refused to do so, up to the amount provided for in the reorganization plan, or - order, in favor of the persons who have undertaken to perform the reorganization plan, the sale of all or part of the share capital held by the shareholders having refused the share capital modification and holding, directly or indirectly a portion of the share capital providing them with a majority of the voting rights (including as a result of an agreement with other shareholders) or a blocking other minority in the company’s shareholder meetings; the minority shareholders have the right to withdraw from the company and request that their shares be purchased by the transferees. In the event of a sale ordered by the court, the price of the shares shall, failing agreement between the parties, be set by a court-designated expert designated by the court in summary proceedings. In either case above, the reorganization plan shall be subject to the undertaking of the new shareholders to hold their shares for a certain time period set by the court which may not exceed the duration of the reorganization plan. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, which is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). No maximum time period is provided by law to limit the duration of the judicial liquidation process. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order for payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. The aim of liquidation proceedings is to liquidate the debtor by selling its business, as a whole or per branch of activity, or its individual assets. The court may commence a judicial liquidation rather than a judicial reorganization when it considers that the debtor is unable to continue its business or that there are no serious chances of improving the company’s prospects through restructuring. The court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain, the liquidator has sufficient funds to pay off the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to insufficiency of assets (insuffisance d’actif). The court may also terminate the proceedings: - when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets; - in the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, by appointing a _mandataire in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from_ these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. Both the judicial reorganization and the liquidation proceedings trigger an automatic stay of proceedings for the benefit of the debtor. However, in judicial liquidation proceedings, secured creditors benefiting from a pledge may request to enforce their security interest through a court-monitored foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) (i.e., request the court to transfer ownership of the pledged asset). _The hardening period (période suspecte) and Void and Voidable Transactions in judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings._ The date of insolvency (cessation des paiements) is deemed to be the date of the court order commencing proceedings, unless the court sets an earlier date, which may be up to 18 months before the date of the court order. Except for fraud, the date of insolvency may not be fixed at an earlier date than the date of the final court decision that approved (homologation) a conciliation agreement. The date of insolvency is important because it marks the beginning of the hardening period (période suspecte), being the period from the insolvency date of the debtor to the court decision commencing the judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings affecting it. Certain transactions undertaken during such “hardening” period may become void or voidable. Void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for ----- the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the company significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner that is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, any escrow ordered as security or as a provisional measure by a judicial decision if such decision is not final when reorganization or liquidation proceedings are commenced, security granted for debts previously incurred, any provisional attachment or seizure measures (unless the writ of attachment or seizure predates the date of insolvency), operations relating to stock options, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless the transfer is made as a security for an indebtedness entered into simultaneously), modifications to existing trust arrangements (fiducie) that affect assets or rights already transferred in the trust as security for debt incurred prior to such amendment and notarized declarations of exemption of assets from seizure (déclaration d’insaisissabilité). Voidable transactions include transactions or payments for due debts, transactions for consideration and notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers détenteurs), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions made during the hardening period, if the party dealing with the company knew that it was insolvent at the time the transaction was entered into or at the time the payment is made. Transactions relating to the transfer of assets for no consideration are also voidable when entered into during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period. There is no hardening period prior to the opening of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Nor are “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (in accordance with a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n° 12-22.909, which case law is likely to be extended to safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). However, the court-appointed administrator can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. Conversely, the administrator can require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that the debtor fully performs its post-commencement contractual obligations (and provided that, in the case of reorganization proceedings, absent consent to other terms of payment, the debtor pays cash on delivery). The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a “plan for the sale of the business” (plan de cession) (which it may do for a period of three months, renewable once); in such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the court decision adopting the “plan for the sale of the business” or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends. As from the court decision commencing the proceedings: - accrual of interest is suspended, except in respect of loans for a term of at least one year, or of contracts providing for a payment which is deferred by at least one year (however, accrued interest can no longer be compounded); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings, subject to specified exceptions (which essentially cover the set-off of related (connexes) debts and payments authorized by the insolvency judge (juge commissaire) to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business); - the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings, unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and which were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services ----- rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly filed within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors may not pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or a guarantor of the debtor where such guarantor is a natural person) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings, if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due in order to file a proof of claim, as described below); - to terminate a contract for non-payment of amounts owed by the creditor; - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor except (i) in judicial liquidation proceedings, by way of the applicable specific process for judicial foreclosure (attribution judiciaire) of the pledged assets or (ii) where such asset- whether tangible or intangible, movable or immovable-is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency proceedings, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the New Insolvency Regulation; or - in the context of reorganization or liquidation proceedings only, absent consent to other terms of payment, immediate cash payment for services rendered pursuant to an ongoing contract (contrats en cours), will be required. In accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors that fall within the scope of the proceedings (see above). As a general rule, creditors whose debts arose prior to the commencement of the proceedings must file a claim with the court appointed _mandataire judiciaire within two months of the publication of the court order in the _Bulletin Officiel des Annonces Civiles et Commerciales; this period is extended to four months for creditors_ domiciled outside France. Creditors on whose behalf no claim has been submitted during the relevant period are, during the relevant period are, except for limited exceptions, barred from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limits and are preferential creditors under French law. At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the court-appointed administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim, the claim as reported by the debtor is deemed to be a filing of the claim with the creditors’ representative on behalf of the creditor. Creditors are allowed to ratify or amend a proof of claim so made on their behalf until the insolvency judge rules on the admissibility of the claim. They may also file their own proof of claim within the deadlines described above. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings however, the debtor draws a list of the claims of its creditors having taken part in the conciliation proceedings, which is certified by its statutory auditors or accountant. Although such creditors may file proofs of claim as part of the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust if necessary the amounts of their claims as set forth in the list prepared by the debtor (within the above two or four months’ time limit). Creditors that did not take part in the conciliation proceedings would have to file their proofs of claim within the aforementioned deadlines. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, accelerated safeguard plan, accelerated financial safeguard plan or reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. If the court adopts a plan of sale of the business (plan de cession), the proceeds from the sale will be allocated for the payment of creditors according to the ranking of their claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the liquidator appointed by the court will be in charge of settling the debtor’s debts in accordance with their ranking. French insolvency court, law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferred creditors, including employees, post-commencement legal costs (essentially, court officials fees), creditors who benefit from a New Money Lien, ----- (see above), post-commencement privileged creditors and the French State (taxes and social charges). In the event of judicial liquidation proceedings only, certain pre-commencement secured creditors whose claim is secured by real estate are paid prior to post-commencement privileged creditors. This order of priority does not apply to all creditors, for example it does not apply to creditors benefiting from a retention right over assets with respect to their claim related to such asset. _Credit Providers’ Liability_ Pursuant to article L. 650-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), where safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings have been commenced, creditors having provided financing to the debtor may only be held liable for the losses suffered as a result of the provision of such financings, if the granting of such facilities was wrongful and, in addition, in the event of: (i) fraud, (ii) interference with the management of the debtor or (iii) the security or guarantees taken to support the facilities are disproportionate to such facilities. In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In particular, it encourages the use of court-assisted proceedings (mandat ad hoc and conciliation) and lengthens the timeframe for court-administered proceedings. The provisions of these ordinances are applicable until December 31, 2020 or July 17, 2021, as the case may be. _Insolvency test_ The French Covid Insolvency Ordinances modified the insolvency test (see “—France—General Consideration _–Insolvency test” above) and provide that, until August 23, 2020 included, such insolvency test will be considered_ in light of the debtor’s situation on March 12, 2020, absent fraud. As a result of this change, debtors who, absent these two ordinances, would have met such insolvency test between March 13, 2020 and August 23, 2020 are not required (but still have the ability) to file for insolvency proceedings within 45 days, which means that such debtors would still have access to court-assisted proceedings and safeguard proceedings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, debtors could petition for judicial reorganization and judicial liquidation proceedings during the period between March 13, 2020 and August 23, 2020 if they meet the insolvency test, prior to its modification by Ordinance n° 2020-341 of 27 March 27, 2020. _Enhanced information of the president of the commercial court for the prevention of company difficulties_ Under the early warning procedure (procedure d’alerte) provided for in articles L. 234-1, L. 234-2 and L. 612-3 of the French Commercial Code, the statutory auditors have the option, after having informed the legal representative of the company of events likely to compromise the going concern, of notifying the president of the competent court of the inadequacy or lack of measures taken by the legal representative. The purpose of this measure is to provide the president of the court as early as possible and as promptly as possible, with information relating to the difficulties encountered by a company. These provisions are applicable until and including December 31, 2020. _Enhanced effectiveness of conciliation proceedings_ The French Covid Insolvency Ordinances implement measures aimed at considerably enhancing the efficiency of conciliation proceedings. The duration of conciliation proceedings is increased by five months, thereby increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to 10 months (instead of five months previously). Until December 31, 2020, if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor in ----- conciliation may apply to the president of the court which ordered the commencement of the procedure, in ex _parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings:_ - to stay or prohibit any legal action by a creditor with a view to order the debtor to pay a sum of money or to terminate a contract for non-payment of a sum of money; - to stay or prohibit any enforcement proceedings by a creditor on both movable and immovable property, as well as any distribution proceedings which have not become fully effective prior to the application; and - to defer or reschedule creditors’ claims which are dues. These measures may be combined with the request for grace period under Articles 1343-5 of the French Civil Codes, as already provided for in article L. 611-7 of the French Commercial Code (see “—France—General _Consideration - Grace periods” above). Even before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for_ payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation. These new provisions allow the implementation of a hybrid conciliation procedure, the effects of which are akin to those of safeguard proceedings but without the disadvantages. These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2020. _Provisions aimed at facilitating the use of accelerated proceedings_ The use of accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) is facilitated, by removing the threshold conditions provided for in article L. 628-1 of the French Commercial Code relating to the employees and turnover thresholds for the safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) and the financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée). If the accelerated safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde accélérée) or financial safeguard proceedings (procédure de sauvegarde financière accélérée) fail and no plan is drawn up within the period provided for in the first paragraph of article L. 628-8 of the French Commercial Code, the court may immediately, at the request of the debtor, the judicial administrator (administrateur judiciaire), the creditors’ representative (mandataire _judiciaire) or the public prosecutor (ministere public), open separate judicial reorganization (procédure de redressement) or liquidation proceedings (procédure de liquidation judiciaire). The aim is to make these pre-pack_ proceedings available to as many companies as possible. These provisions are applicable to proceedings initiated between May 21, 2020 until the earlier of July 17, 2021 (inclusive) and the date of entry into force of the upcoming ordinance that will transpose under French law the requirements of EU Directive 2019/1023 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 (i.e., the insolvency proceedings harmonisation directive). _Provisions to facilitate the adoption of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) or a judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement)_ The adoption of a safeguard or judicial reorganization plan is facilitated and accelerated by: - shortening the timelines for consulting creditors to 15 days in the event of the presentation of a draft plan at the request of the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) or the judicial administrator (administrateur judiciaire), with the authorisation of the insolvency judge (juge _commissaire);_ - a reduction in the formalities for consulting creditors: proposals for the settlement of debts as well as any responses to these proposals may be communicated by any means enabling the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire) to establish with certainty the date of their receipt; - the finalization of the plan exceptionally based on outsatnding liabilities estimated on the basis of a certificate from the chartered-accountant (expert-comptable) or statutory auditor, on admitted, uncontested and identifiable claims (those for which the deadline for filing has not expired). ----- These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings up to and including December 31, 2020. _Provisions aimed at facilitating the implementation of a safeguard plan (plan de sauvegarde) and a judicial reorganization plan (plan de redressement)_ The Ordinance dated May 20, 2020 provides for provisions to facilitate the implementation of safeguard and judicial reorganization plans by: - increasing by a maximum of two years the duration of the execution of the safeguard or judicial reorganization plans (i.e. a maximum duration of 12 years or 17 years in the agricultural sector); - deeming failure to reply from creditors consulted for the adoption or modification of the plan to be acceptance of the proposed new payment terms; - introducing a post-money lien (a new “safeguard or judicial reorganization” privilege similar to the “new money” privilege), for persons who make a new cash contribution to the debtor either during the observation period, or within the framework of the safeguard or judicial reorganization plan (these new contributions will be mentioned in the judgment which adopts or modifies the plan). Creditors benefiting from this safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege are paid, for the amount of their contribution, in the order provided for in III of article L. 622-17 and III of article L. 641-13 of the French Commercial Code, i.e., after wage claims. Contributions granted by the shareholders and partners of the debtor in the context of a capital increase are excluded from the safeguard or judicial reorganization privilege. These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31,, with the exception of the provisions on the safeguard privilege applicable as from May 21, 2020 and at the latest until and including July 17, 2021. _Provisions to facilitate the sale of the business_ Adjustments relating to the sale of the business have been provided and in particular, a reduction in the notice period required to convene the contracting parties provided for in article R. 642-7 of the French Commercial Code from 15 to 8 days in the event of a plan for the sale of the business (this notice period may however be modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020). These provisions are applicable to ongoing proceedings and until and including December 31, 2020. _Provisions aimed at facilitating recovery of the company_ The period at the end of which the mention in the trade and company registry of safeguard and judicial reorganisation proceedings is deleted from the register if the plan is still in progress is reduced to one year (this period may however be modified by decree pursuant to article 10 of ordinance dated May 20, 2020).

In certain circumstances, where a French company acts in breach of its requirement to act for its corporate benefit, its officers may incur civil and/or criminal liability. In addition, under French law, a French court may, under certain circumstances, set aside a guarantee granted by a French company if such company derives no corporate benefit. While the granting of guarantees by a parent company with respect to the obligations of its subsidiary are deemed to be, in principle, for the corporate benefit of the parent company, the granting of cross or upstream guarantees by a subsidiary may be more problematic from that perspective. ----- Furthermore, under French financial assistance rules, a company limited by shares may not advance funds, grant loans or grant security for the purposes of the subscription or the acquisition of its own shares by a third party. Breach of French financial assistance rules may result in criminal liability for the officers of the company acting in breach of these rules and their accomplices. Moreover, a court could declare any guarantee given in breach of such rules unenforceable and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor. Based upon the above, guarantee limitation language has been agreed in this transaction with respect to the Notes Guarantees to be granted by Guarantors incorporated under the laws of France (each, a “French Guarantor”) in respect of the payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes: - the obligations and liabilities of a French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee will not include any obligation or liability which, if incurred, would constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of article L.225-216 of the French Commercial Code or any other laws having the same effect and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets or corporate credit within the meaning of articles L.241-3, L. 242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code; and - the aggregate obligations and liabilities of a French company under its Notes Guarantee for the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes shall be limited, at any time, to an amount equal to the aggregate of the proceeds of the Notes to the extent directly or indirectly on lent by the Issuer to, or used to refinance any indebtedness previously on-lent directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries under intercompany loans or similar arrangements and outstanding at the time a demand is made from such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee, it being specified that any payment made by any such French Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee shall reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans (if any) due by such French Guarantor under the intercompany loan arrangements referred to above. However, the balance of such intercompany loans, which are financed directly or indirectly with the proceeds of the Notes, will increase and decrease in the ordinary course of business, in line with the needs of the business and availability of such proceeds for other utilizations. By virtue of this limitation, the Guarantors obligation under the Notes Guarantees could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or the Guarantors may have effectively no obligation under the Notes Guarantees. In addition, if a Guarantor receives, in return for issuing the guarantee, an economic return that is less than the economic benefit such Guarantor would obtain in a transaction entered into on an arm’s length basis, the difference between the actual economic benefit and that in a comparable arm’s-length transaction could be taxable under certain circumstances. The existence of a real and adequate benefit to any Guarantor and whether the amounts guaranteed are commensurate with the benefit received are matters of fact as to which French case law provides no clear guidance. A French insolvency court may also refuse to enforce a guarantee if it is determined that the grantor was insolvent at the time the guarantee was granted and that the relevant secured party had knowledge, at the time the guarantee was granted, of such insolvency.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Under French law, generally speaking, pledges over assets may be enforced at the option of the secured creditors either (i) before a court (a) by way of a sale of the pledged assets in a public auction (the proceeds of the sale being paid to the secured creditors) or (b) by way of the judicial foreclosure of the pledged assets or (ii) by way of contractual foreclosure (pacte commissoire) of the pledged assets to the secured creditors, following which (in either case) the secured creditors become the legal owner of the pledged assets. Enforcement by way of private sale (not being contractual foreclosure) may not be agreed at the time of granting of the security and, therefore, the holders of the Notes will not benefit from such enforcement method. ----- If the secured creditors choose enforcement by way of foreclosure (whether judicial or contractual), the secured liabilities will be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed assets. Such value is determined either by the judge in the context of a judicial foreclosure or by an expert (pre-contractually agreed or appointed by a judge) in the context of a contractual foreclosure. If the value of the pledged assets exceeds the amount of the secured liabilities, the secured creditors will be required to pay to the relevant pledgor an amount (soulte) equal to the difference between the value of the foreclosed assets and the amount of the secured liabilities. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditor from a subsequent on-sale of the foreclosed assets. On the contrary, if the value of such foreclosed assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured. Should the beneficiaries of the Notes Collateral decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the securities, enforcement of the pledged securities could be undertaken through the sale of the pledged shares by public auction. Because public auction procedures are not designed for a sale of a business as a going concern, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the group as a going concern. _Parallel Debt_ Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of the creditors by third parties that do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent under Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a Parallel Debt. Pursuant to the Parallel Debt, the Security Agent will become the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The pledges governed by French law will directly secure the Parallel Debt, and the other indebtedness secured by the Notes Collateral and will not directly secure the obligations under the Notes. Although the French Supreme Court (Cour _de cassation) has held (in a decision dated September 13, 2011 (Cass. com. September 13, 2011 n°10 -25533_ Belvedere) rendered in the context of safeguard proceedings opened in France) that, subject to certain conditions being met, the concept of “parallel debt” governed by the laws of the State of New York was not incompatible with the French law concept of international public policy (ordre public international), this decision cannot be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a parallel debt obligation and no assurance can be given that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. There is no certainty that the Parallel Debt construction will eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the Notes Collateral created under the Parallel Debt structure are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interest in the Notes Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The action paulienne offers creditors protection against a decrease in their means of recovery. A legal act performed by a person (including, without limitation, an agreement pursuant to which it guarantees the performance of the obligations of a third party or agrees to provide or provides security for any of its or a third party’s obligations, and or enters into additional agreements benefiting from existing security and any other legal act having similar effect) can be challenged in or outside insolvency proceedings of the relevant person by the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the commissioner of the safeguard or recovery plan (commissaire à l’exécution du plan), insolvency proceedings of the relevant person or by any of the creditors of the relevant person outside insolvency proceedings or any creditor that was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act in or outside insolvency proceedings, and may be declared unenforceable against third parties if: (i) the person performed such acts without an obligation to do so; (ii) the ----- relevant creditor or, in the case of the person’s insolvency proceedings, any creditor, was prejudiced in its means of recovery as a consequence of the act; and (iii) at the time the act was performed both the person and the counterparty to the transaction knew or should have known that one or more of its creditors (existing or future) would be prejudiced in their means of recovery, unless the act was entered into for no consideration (à titre gratuit), in which case such knowledge of the counterparty is not necessary for a successful challenge on the grounds of fraudulent conveyance. If a court found that the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Notes Collateral, or the granting of a Notes Guarantee involved a fraudulent conveyance that did not qualify for any defense under applicable law, then the issuance of the Notes, the granting of the security interests in the Notes Collateral or the granting of such Notes Guarantee could be declared unenforceable against third parties or declared unenforceable against the creditor who lodged the claim in relation to the relevant act. As a result of such successful challenges, holders of the Notes may not benefit from the Notes or the security interests in the Notes Collateral and the value of any consideration that holders of the Notes received with respect to the Notes or the security interests in the Notes Collateral could also be subject to recovery from the holders of the Notes and, possibly, from subsequent transferees.

Limitations imposed by law. Pursuant to the Luxembourg Civil Code, a company is incorporated with a view to participate in the profits (and the losses) which may arise therefrom. The goal to share the profits is an essential element of every company and therefore, a purely free (or gratuitous) act, without consideration, may be outside the scope of the activities of a company as contemplated by law. A company may however carry out gratuitous acts whenever these acts are accomplished with a view to the realization, directly or indirectly, of the company’s corporate objective. It is normally understood that except in exceptional circumstances, an intragroup security is a type of act which may serve the purpose of realizing a profit. Thus, it is only in exceptional circumstances where there is no reasonable indirect potential benefit of, or a motivated interest for, a proposed guarantee/security to be given by a company, that the validity of such a guarantee/security interest could be challenged for lack of any interest by the guarantor in providing the guarantee/security interest. Further to this general legal restriction, additional limitations are imposed by specific laws, such as the prohibition to exercise a financial activity without a specific authorization (which in the case of a Luxembourg company, does not apply to financial activities within a group of companies) or the limitation on financial assistance to shareholders in the case of subscription or purchase of shares of the guarantor. 2. Limitations imposed by the articles of association. The provision of guarantees or security interests by a Luxembourg company must be within the limits of the object clause of its articles of association. Should the provision of a guarantee or security by a Luxembourg company be considered to exceed the corporate objective as expressed in the articles of association, the Luxembourg company is still bound by such action, unless there is evidence that the beneficiary of such acts knew that the acts exceeded the corporate objective or that the beneficiary could not, in light of the circumstances, have been unaware of that fact. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The concept of “corporate interest” is_ not defined by law, but has been developed by doctrine and court precedents and may be described as being “the limit of acceptable corporate behavior”. Whereas the previous discussions regarding the limits of corporate power are based on objective criteria (provisions of law and of the articles of association), the concept of corporate benefit requires a subjective judgment. In that context, the concept of a group of companies may be relevant, and while it should first be analyzed whether a transaction is in the best interest of the Luxembourg company on a standalone basis, it should also be examined whether the transaction is justified in the light of the interest at the level of the group, which may result in a benefit for the guarantor. In general terms, group interest may justify the issue of a guarantee or the granting of security in favor of a parent company (upstream guarantee) or a sister company (cross stream guarantee), under the following circumstances: - the proposed action must be justified on the basis of a common economic, social, or financial policy applicable throughout the whole group; - the existence of a group should be evidenced through capital links; or - the proposed action must (i) not be without any consideration, or alternatively (ii) not break up the balance between the undertakings of the various group companies. To the extent that all companies of the group are asked to bear the burden of guarantees or security given for the benefit of the other group company or companies in an equal way, the obligation undertaken by a group company for the benefit of other group companies may be justified. Similarly, if a group company cannot exist outside of the group and is dependent on the group, assistance to other group companies should ultimately result in a benefit for such company. The limit of reasonable corporate behavior is reached when the transaction is exclusively in the interest of the parent company or the other companies of the group, without any benefit, direct or indirect, for the Luxembourg company granting the guarantee. However, the failure to comply with the corporate benefit requirement will typically result in liability for the directors or managers of the guarantor concerned. There is a limited risk that the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company be held liable if, inter alia: - the guarantee/security interest so provided would materially exceed the (direct or indirect) benefit deriving from the secured obligations for the Luxembourg company; or - the Luxembourg company derives no personal benefit or obtains no direct or indirect consideration for the guarantee/security interest granted; or - the commitment of the Luxembourg company exceeds its financial means. In addition to any criminal and civil liability incurred by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg company, the guarantee/security interest could itself be held unenforceable, if it is held that it is contrary to public policy (ordre public). The above analysis is slightly different within a group of companies where a group interest (intérêt du groupe) exists. The existence of a group interest would prevent the guarantee/security interest from falling foul of the above constraints. In order for a group interest to be recognized, the following cumulative criteria must be met and proven: ----- - the “assisting” company must receive some benefit, or there must be a balance between the respective commitments of all the affiliates; - the guarantee must not exceed the assisting company’s financial means; - the companies involved must form part of a genuine group operating under a common strategy aimed at a common objective; and - the assistance must be granted for purposes of promoting a common economic, social and financial interest determined in accordance with policies applicable to the entire group. The criteria mentioned above is applied on a case-by-case basis and a subjective fact-based judgment is required to be made by the directors or managers of the Luxembourg guarantor. As a result, the guarantees (upstream and cross stream) granted by a Luxembourg company are subject to certain limitations, which usually take the form of general limitation language, which is inserted in the relevant transaction document(s) and which covers the aggregate obligations and exposure of the relevant Luxembourg assisting company under the transaction documents. The Indenture will contain the following limitation language: The guarantee granted by any Guarantor which is incorporated and/or having its registered office and its place of central administration in Luxembourg (a “Luxembourg Guarantor”) for the obligations of the Issuer which is not a direct or indirect subsidiary of such Luxembourg Guarantor shall be limited at any time to an aggregate amount not exceeding: (i) the aggregate amount of the outstanding intercompany loans made to the Luxembourg Guarantor or subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor (which are subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor on the Issue Date or which will be subsidiaries of that Luxembourg Guarantor hereafter) by the Issuer which have been funded directly or indirectly with proceeds deriving from the sale of the Notes increased by (ii) the greater of: (a) 90% of the sum of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres) and subordinated debt (dettes subordonnées, including for the avoidance of doubt intragroup liabilities), both as referred to in Annex I of the Luxembourg Grand-Ducal Regulation of December 18, 2015 in relation to, _inter alia, Article 34 of the Luxembourg law of December 18, 2002 on the commercial register and annual accounts, as amended (the “2002 Law”) or, as applicable, as referred to in the Grand-Ducal Regulation of September 12, 2019 (Règlement Grand-Ducal du _12 septembre 2019 déterminant le contenu du plan comptable normalisé visé à l’article 12 du Code de commerce), as of the issue date (whether as original party or by way of accession);_ (b) 90% of the sum of the Luxembourg Guarantor’s own funds (capitaux propres) and subordinated debt (dettes subordonnées, including for the avoidance of doubt intragroup liabilities), both as referred to in Annex I of the Luxembourg Grand-Ducal Regulation of December 18, 2015 in relation to, inter alia, Article 34 of the 2002 Law, or, as applicable, as referred to in the GrandDucal Regulation of September 12, 2019 (Règlement Grand-Ducal du 12 septembre 2019 _déterminant le contenu du plan comptable normalisé visé à l’article 12 du Code de commerce),_ as at the date on which a demand is made under the Notes; (c) 90% of the net assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor calculated on the basis of the fair market value of the assets minus liabilities of the Luxembourg Guarantor (as determined by the agent or if the agent so decides by a Luxembourg statutory approved auditor (réviseur d’entreprise _agréé) (an “Independent Auditor”) as of the issue date (whether as original party or by way_ of accession); or (d) 90% of the net assets of the Luxembourg Guarantor calculated on the basis of the fair market value of the assets minus liabilities of the Luxembourg Guarantor (as determined by the Trustee or if the Trustee so decides by an Independent Auditor as of the date on which a demand is made under the Notes). -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The insolvency laws of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may not be as favorable to your interests as creditors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which you may be familiar. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of insolvency law in Luxembourg. In the event that a Luxembourg company experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Pursuant to Luxembourg insolvency laws, your ability to receive payment under the Notes may be more limited than would be the case under U.S. bankruptcy laws. Under Luxembourg law, the following types of proceedings (collectively referred to as “insolvency proceedings”) may be opened against a company incorporated in Luxembourg having its center of main interests in Luxembourg or an establishment within the meaning of the New Insolvency Regulation (in relation to secondary proceedings): - bankruptcy proceedings (faillite), the opening of which may be requested by the Luxembourg company or by any of its creditors. Following such a request, the courts having jurisdiction may open bankruptcy proceedings if the Luxembourg company: (i) is in a state of cessation of payments (cessation des paiements) and (ii) has lost its commercial creditworthiness (ébranlement de crédit). If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may open bankruptcy proceedings on its own motion. The main effect of such proceedings is the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the Luxembourg company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for enforcement by secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the assets; - controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the Luxembourg company and not by its creditors and under which a court may order a provisional suspension of payments, including a stay of enforcement of claims by secured creditors; or - composition proceedings (concordat préventif de faillite), the opening of which may only be requested by the Luxembourg company (subject to obtaining the consent of the majority of its creditors) and not by its creditors themselves. The court’s decision to admit a company to composition proceedings triggers a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by creditors. In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a reprieve from payments (sursis de paiement) or to put a Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire). Judicial liquidation proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity that violates criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the Luxembourg law dated August 10, 1915 on commercial companies, as amended. The management of such liquidation proceedings will generally follow rules similar to those applicable to bankruptcy proceedings. Liability of a Luxembourg company in respect of the Notes will, in the event of a liquidation of such Luxembourg company following bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings, only rank after the cost of liquidation (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such liquidation) and those debts of the relevant entity that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential debts under Luxembourg law include, among others: ----- - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - VAT and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. The ability of certain secured creditors to enforce their security interest may also be limited, in particular in the event of controlled management proceedings providing expressly that the rights of secured creditors are frozen until a final decision has been taken by the court as to the petition for controlled management, and may be affected thereafter by a reorganization order given by the court. A reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the creditors representing more than 50% of the relevant Luxembourg company’s liabilities in order to take effect. Furthermore, declarations of default and subsequent acceleration (such as acceleration upon the occurrence of an event of default) may not be enforceable during controlled management proceedings. Luxembourg insolvency law may affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the period before the opening of the insolvency proceedings. If the liquidator or administrator (including, without limitation, in relation to a Luxembourg company, any _commissaire,_ _juge-commissaire, liquidateur or _curateur or similar official) can show that the Luxembourg company has given “preference” to any person by_ defrauding the rights of creditors generally, regardless of when this fraud occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power to void the “abnormal” transaction. If the liquidator or administrator can show that: (i) a payment in relation to a due debt was made during the hardening period (période suspecte, which is a maximum of six months and ten days preceding the judgment declaring the opening of the insolvency proceedings) that is disadvantageous to the general body of creditors; and/or (ii) the party receiving such payment is shown to have known that the bankrupt party had ceased to make payments when such payment occurred, a Luxembourg court has the power, among other things, to void the preferential transaction. In particular: - pursuant to Article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce (code de commerce), specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts that have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by a bill of exchange; the sale of assets without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) must be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the insolvency receiver; - pursuant to Article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts as well as other transactions concluded for consideration during the suspect period are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt party’s cessation of payments; - pursuant to Article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and Article 1167 of the Civil Code (action paulienne) the insolvency receiver (acting on behalf of the creditors) has the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions, including the granting of security with an intent to defraud, made prior to the bankruptcy, without any time limit; and - pursuant to Article 21(2) of the Collateral Act 2005, a financial collateral arrangement entered into after the opening of liquidation proceedings or the coming into force of reorganization measures or the entry into force of such measures is valid and binding against third parties, administrators, insolvency receivers or liquidators notwithstanding the suspect period referred to in Articles 445 and 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, if the collateral taker proves that it was unaware of the fact that such proceedings had been opened or that such measures had been taken or that it could not reasonably be aware of it. ----- In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for _intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the Luxembourg company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the Luxembourg company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. The bankruptcy order provides for a period of time during which creditors must file their claims with the clerk’s office of the Luxembourg district court sitting in commercial matters. After having converted all available assets of the Luxembourg company into cash and after having determined all the Luxembourg company’s liabilities, the insolvency receiver will distribute the proceeds of the sale, on a pro rata basis, to the creditors after deduction of the receiver fees and the bankruptcy administration costs. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the notes. The bankruptcy receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the Luxembourg company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party that are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract. International aspects of Luxembourg bankruptcy, controlled management or voluntary arrangement with creditors’ proceedings may be subject to the New Insolvency Regulation. Pursuant to the New Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the New Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its center of main interests is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “center of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Although there is a rebuttable presumption under Article 3(1) of the New Insolvency Regulation that any such company has its center of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office, Preamble 30 of the New Insolvency Regulation states that the “center of main interests” of a debtor should correspond to the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and “is therefore ascertainable by third parties”. In that respect, factors such as where board meetings are held, the location where a company conducts the majority of its business and the location where the majority of a company’s creditors are established may all be relevant in the determination of the place where a company has its center of main interests. The time when a company’s center of main interests is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. If the center of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of such company under the New Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the New Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the New Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If the center of main interests of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the New Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the New ----- Insolvency Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If a company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the New Insolvency Regulation. To the extent that our center of main interests is deemed to be outside Luxembourg, courts of such other jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of such company -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

However, the debtor is validly discharged from its payment obligations by payment to the pledgor as long as it has not gained knowledge of the pledge. Article 11 of the Collateral Act 2005 sets out the following enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event: - appropriate or cause a third party to appropriate this collateral at a price determined, before or after appropriation, by the valuation method agreed by the parties; - assign or cause to be assigned the pledged collateral by private sale in a commercially reasonable manner, by sale over a stock exchange or by public auction; - court adjudication of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. As the Collateral Act 2005 does not provide any specific time periods and depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as, e.g., courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. The perfection of the security interests created pursuant to the pledge agreements does not prevent any third party creditor from seeking attachment or execution against the assets, which are subject to the security interests created under the pledge agreements, to satisfy their unpaid claims against the pledgor. Except as provided in Article 20(4) of the Collateral Act 2005, a third party creditor may seek the forced sale of the assets of the pledgor which are subject to such security through court proceedings, although the beneficiaries under the relevant pledge or security documents will remain entitled to priority over the proceeds of such sale. Under Luxembourg law, security interests qualifying as financial collateral arrangements under the Collateral Act 2005 may be granted in favor of a person acting on behalf of the beneficiaries of such security interests, a fiduciary or a trustee as a security for the claims of third party beneficiaries, present or future, to the extent that such third party beneficiaries are or may be determined.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,France,23.1.1,,"The following is a summary of certain legal aspects of French law regarding the enforcement of civil law claims connected with the Notes against French Entities and/or French Individuals. The United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court (Tribunal judiciaire) that has exclusive jurisdiction over such matter. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment was rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the matter because the dispute is clearly connected to the jurisdiction of such court (i.e., there was no international forum-shopping), the choice of the U.S. court was not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, pertaining both to the merits and to the procedure of the case, including fair trial rights; and - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud. In addition to these conditions, it is well established that only final and binding foreign judicial decisions (i.e., those having a res judicata effect) can benefit from an exequatur under French law, that such U.S. judgment should not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment that has become effective in France, and there is no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the U.S. judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. If the French civil court is satisfied that such conditions are met, the U.S. judgment will benefit from the res judicata effect as of the date of the decision of the French civil court and will thus be declared enforceable in France. However, the decision granting the exequatur is subject to appeal. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and French Ordinance No. 2000 916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to the communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons), which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. Pursuant to the regulations above, the U.S. authorities would have to comply with international (the 1970 Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in civil or commercial matters) and/or French procedural rules to obtain evidence in France or from French persons. Besides, pursuant to French Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016, and Decree No. 2016-66 of January 26, 2016, companies in France that are the subject of a request for documents and information from foreign authorities may be assisted by French administrative authorities, in particular the French Anti-Corruption Agency (Agence française anti-corruption) and the Strategic Information and Economic Security Service (Service de l'information stratégique et de la _sécurité économique), which are responsible for ensuring the application of law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as_ modified by French law No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980. ----- Similarly, French data protection rules (law No. 78 17 of 6 January 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as modified) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. Furthermore, if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply foreign law designated by the applicable French rules of conflict (including the law chosen by the parties to govern their contract) if the application of such law (in the case at hand) is deemed to contravene French international public policy (as determined on a case by case basis by French courts). Furthermore, in an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have all of the remedies sought. Pursuant to Article 14 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the foreign defendant in France with a French person or in a foreign country with French individuals. Pursuant to Article 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts in connection with the performance of obligations contracted by the French national in a foreign country with the foreign claimant (Article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French courts’ jurisdiction over French nationals is not mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction that has sufficient contacts with the dispute and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, a French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, including by way of conduct by voluntarily appearing before the foreign court.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,"It must be noted that under Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of December 12, 2012, as regards legal actions falling within the scope of said Regulation, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to Articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in an EU Member State. Conversely, pursuant to Article 6.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 1215/2012, the privilege granted by Article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France, regardless of the claimant’s nationality, to sue before French courts a defendant domiciled outside the EU. The French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) has held that a contractual provision submitting one party to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the discretionary option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid, if the choice resulting from this option is entirely unforeseeable (Cour de cassation, decision no. 16-24.497; February 7, 2018). Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents would not be binding on the party submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the court or prevent a French party from bringing an action before the French courts.

We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law if the choice of such foreign law was not made bona fide or if (i) the foreign law was not pleaded and proved or (ii) if pleaded and proved, such foreign law was contrary to mandatory Luxembourg laws or incompatible with Luxembourg public policy rules.

The Board of Directors believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results. The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Directors are: - Adjusted EBITDA; - Revenues; - Capital expenditure (“Capex”); and - Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”). Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of Altice’s financial statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that Altice’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The non-GAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also, de facto, the metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenant has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 16 – Leases by the Group.

This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the operating results. Operating results presented in the annual consolidated financial statements are in accordance with IAS 1 – Presentation of financial statements. - _Capex Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities: - The fixed business has fixed capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general), and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premise Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.). - Mobile capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and licenses to operate; once engaged and operational, there are limited further capex requirements. - Other capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights. - _Operating free cash flow OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex.

The Group also entered into a new fixed to floating swap with the same counterparty, for the same nominal amounts, with USD receive rate of USD libor 6m+ 3% and a EUR paying rate of 4.783%. This new swap has a forward start in May 2026, with a maturity date of May 2030. - Removal of mandatory breaks on a swap nominal of $1,790 million associated with the USD TLB 12. Previous mandatory breaks were all positioned in 2020. Following the removal of the mandatory breaks, the Euro paying rate was adjusted for almost all legs of the swap. The new weighted average euro paying rate increased from Euribor 3m+3.124% to Euribor 3m+3.244%. Following these modifications, the Group received a net amount of €236.3 million as cash from the restrike of the CCS, which was also recorded as income in the consolidated statement of income. The income was offset by a negative variation .of the fair value of the restructured CCS swaps. The realized and unrealized FX gain on CCS is offset by the unrealized FX loss on the debts. The Group also entered into new IRS swaps for a total nominal amount of €3,400 million, with two legs as described below: - A floating to fixed swap with an average receive fixed rate of 6.139% and a floating pay rate of Euribor 6m+3% from 2020 to 2024; - A fixed to floating swap with an average fixed paying rate of 4.627% and an average receive rate of Euribor 6m+3% from 2020 to 2030. On an annual basis, the above IRS will allow the Group to economise €51.4 million in cash interest expense from 2020 to 2024.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; ----- - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

In addition, IFRIC 23 had no material impact on the amounts recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements and resulted in a reclassification of the provisions for tax risk to deferred tax liabilities and current tax payable.

The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of_ leases and requires lessees to account for most leases under a single on-consolidated statement of financial position model. The change of definition of a lease mainly relates to the conception of control. IFRS 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange of consideration. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from IAS 17. Lessors will continue to classify leases as either operating or finance leases using similar principles as in IAS 17. Therefore, IFRS 16 did not have an impact for leases where the Group is the lessor. The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective method of adoption with the date of initial application of January 1, 2019. Under this method, the standard is applied retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application. Therefore, 2018 financial statements were not restated under the new standard. The effect of adoption IFRS 16 as at January 1, 2019 is as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Before the adoption of IFRS 16, the Group classified each of its leases (as lessee) at the inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. A lease was classified as a finance lease if it transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the Group; otherwise it was classified as an operating lease. ----- Finance leases were capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the inception date fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments were apportioned between interest (recognized as finance costs) and reduction of the lease liability. In an operating lease, the leased property was not capitalised and the lease payments were recognized as rent expense in the consolidated statement of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any prepaid rent and accrued rent were recognized under “Trade and other receivables” and “Trade and other payables”, respectively. Upon adoption of IFRS 16, the Group applied a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases that it is the lessee. The Group recognized lease liabilities to make lease payments and right of use assets representing the right to use the underlying assets. The standard provides specific transition requirements and practical expedients, which have been applied by the Group: - Right of use assets are reported separately in the statement of financial position. - The recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 are also applied to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. - A distinction is made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components except for certain master agreement. - Application of the portfolio approach for the recognition and measurements of certain asset categories with similar characteristics (same residual value, same economic environment), mainly for local loop unbundling. - Application of the standard to contracts that were previously identified as leases under IAS 17 / IFRIC 4 at the transition date. - Calculate outstanding liability for existing operating leases using the incremental borrowing rate at date of transition. - IFRS 16 is not applied to leases for intangible assets. - The Group chooses to apply the relief option, which allows it to adjust the right of use asset by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial application. Based on the aforementioned, as at January 1, 2019: - Right of use assets of €3,233.2 million were recognized and presented separately in the statement of financial position. This includes the lease assets recognized previously under finance leases of €121.4 million that were reclassified from “Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets”. - Additional lease liabilities of €3,213.6 million (current and non-current) were recognized (including the reclassification of finance lease liabilities already recorded as of December 31, 2018 of €79.3 million). - Trade and other receivables of €38.8 million and trade and other payables of €60.3 million related to previous operating leases were derecognized. - Deferred tax liabilities increased by €18.9 million because of the deferred tax impact of the changes in assets and liabilities. - Provision for onerous contract (current and non-current) was reclassified in reduction on right of use assets for €60.0 million. - The net effect of these adjustments had been adjusted to equity for €40.1 million. In addition, the Group is closely monitoring the work of IASB and the IFRS Interpretation Committee, aiming to clarify interpretation of IFRS 16, which could lead to a revision of the accounting policies applied by the Group. In June 2019, the IFRIC issued a tentative agenda decision related to subsurface rights concluding that when a contract between a land owner and another party gives the other party the right to place an oil pipeline in a specified underground space, with the land owner retaining the right to use the surface area of the land above the pipeline, that contract contains a lease. The Group finalised the assessment and there is no material impact as in most of the Group’s contracts, the supplier has a substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use and therefore, the contracts do not contain a lease. ----- The lease liabilities as at January 1, 2019 can be reconciled to the operating lease commitments as of December 31, 2018 as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The Group reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. If the Group does not have a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether the Group’s voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power, including: - the size of the Group’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote holders; - potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties; - rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and - any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings. Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of the Group and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein.

The existence of joint control is then assessed for decisions about the relevant activities that require the unanimous consent of the parties that jointly control the company. Joint arrangements are classified into two categories: - Joint undertakings (or joint operations); these are arrangements in which the parties that have joint control over the company have direct rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. The parties are called the “joint investors.” The joint investor recognizes 100% of the joint operation’s assets/liabilities/expenses/income that it owns itself and the share of the items that it owns jointly. These arrangements involve joint investment agreements signed by the Group. - Joint ventures: these are partnerships in which the parties that have joint control over the company have rights to its net assets. The parties are called the “co-owners.” Each co-owner recognizes its rights to the net assets of the entity using the equity method (see paragraph below). In addition, following the closing of the sale of 49.99% in SFR FTTH (Refer to Note 4.1 – SFR FTTH) and the network deployment and maintenance framework agreement between Altice France and SFR FTTH, the Group adopted the following accounting policies: - The margin realized on intercompany transactions between Altice France and SFR FTTH (sales of assets from Altice France to SFR FTTH are eliminated in the income statement up to Altice France’s share in SFR FTTH based on the provision of IAS 28 – Investments in associates and joint ventures. - In the absence of precise IFRS guidance related to the presentation of the margin elimination in the income statement, the Group has elected to eliminate the margin in the caption “Share of earnings of associates” in the consolidated statement of income in counterpart of the caption “Investment in associates and joint ventures” in the statement of financial position.

Roll-over minutes are recognized for the share of revenue they represent in the telephone subscription at the time they are actually used or when they expire. Revenue on incoming and outgoing calls as well as on calls made outside plans is recognized when the service is rendered. Revenue generated by the coupons sold to distributors and prepaid Mobile cards is recognized as and when the end customer uses them, starting when such coupons and cards are activated. The unused balance is recorded in deferred income at the closing date. The proceeds in any event are recognized on the date of the card’s expiration or when use of the coupon is statistically improbable. Sales of subscription services managed by the Group on behalf of content providers (mainly special numbers and SMS+) are recognized gross, or net of payments made to content providers based on the analysis of each transaction. Accordingly, revenue is recognized net when suppliers are responsible for the content delivered to end customers and for setting the subscription rates. Connection and installation fees billed mainly to operators and business customers during the implementation of services such as ADSL connection, bandwidth capacity or IP connectivity are recognized over the estimated duration of the customer relationship and of the main service supplied, based on statistical data.

Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the year, estimated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, at the contribution of added value of businesses and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences on the closing date between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: (i) the initial recognition of goodwill, (ii) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and (iii) investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and when it is probable that these temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, in accordance with the rules in effect at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities when the taxable entity intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or when tax assets and liabilities are to be realized simultaneously.

The consideration transferred corresponds to the fair value, at the acquisition date, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. The goodwill arising from a business combination is equal to the difference between: - The sum of the consideration paid, the value of any non-controlling interest that remains outstanding after the business combination and, where applicable, the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the target; and - The net amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Goodwill is recognized in assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. When the difference is negative, it is directly recognized through profit or loss. The secondary costs directly attributable to an acquisition giving control are recorded in expenses in the period during which the costs are incurred, except for the borrowing costs, which must be recorded in accordance with IAS 32 – Financial instruments: presentation and IAS 39 – Financial instruments: recognition and measurement. When goodwill is determined provisionally at the end of the period in which the combination is effected, any adjustments to the provisional values within 12 months of the acquisition date are recognized in goodwill. Changes in the Group’s share of ownership of equity securities in a subsidiary which do not lead to a loss of control over the latter are recognized as shareholders’ equity transactions. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing whenever there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, and at least once a year in accordance with the methods and assumptions described in Note 11 – Goodwill _and impairment tests._ After initial recognition, goodwill is recorded at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

The Group recognises right of use assets at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right of use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated amortizations and depreciations, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right of use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Unless the Group is reasonably certain to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognized right of use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term. Right of use assets are subject to impairment. At the commencement date of the lease, the Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments less any lease incentives ----- receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Group and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising the option to terminate. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expense in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the in-substance fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group has the option, under some of its leases, to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, it considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise (or not to exercise) the option to renew (e.g., a change in business strategy). The Group included the renewal period as part of the lease term for leases of technical sites due to the significance of these assets to its operations.

When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interest in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.

Besides, the residual life of customer bases and amortizable brands is analyzed whenever there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. In addition, goodwill, other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets in progress undergo an annual impairment test. Impairment tests are performed in order to compare the recoverable amount of an asset or a Cash-Generating Unit (“CGU”) with its carrying amount. An asset’s or CGU’s net recoverable amount is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use. The recoverable amount is determined for each individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those derived from other assets or groups of assets. In that case, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Given the change in the Group and the significant pooling of assets and services within the Group, a single CGU is defined at the Group level. For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, in conformity with IAS 36, goodwill is allocated as a value to each operating segment (Refer to Note 11.1 – Change in goodwill), and shared assets and liabilities are allocated through distribution keys to each of the operating segments (Refer to Note 11.3 – Main _assumptions used). The principal allocation keys used to allocate shared assets and liabilities are based on revenues, use_ of the network or the information systems. The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the present value of future cash flows (discounted cash flow method or “DCF”) by using a discount rate after tax specific to each asset or group of assets concerned. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable on the measurement date from the sale of the asset or group of assets in an ordinary transaction between market participants, less costs to sell. When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its net recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the “Depreciation, amortization and impairment” caption of the consolidated statement of income.

Under IFRS 9, debt financial assets are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), amortized cost, or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The classification is based on two criteria: the Group’s business model for managing the assets; and whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent ‘solely payments of principal and interest’ on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’).

Events occurring during proceedings may lead at any time to a reassessment of such estimates. - Provisions for restructuring, which are booked once the restructuring has been announced and a plan has been detailed or launched. Such provisions are generally not discounted due to their short-term nature. - Provisions for site remediation, which are assessed based on the number of sites involved, an average unit cost of site remediation and assumptions about the life of the decommissioning asset and the discount rate.

In the current economic environment, changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates or assumptions, which could affect the consolidated statement of financial position, the consolidated statement of income and the consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group. Significant estimates and assumptions relate to the measurement of the following items: - _Provisions: assessment of the risk on a case-by-case basis; it is stipulated that the occurrence of events during a proceeding period may at any time trigger a reassessment of the risk (Refer to Note 26 – Provisions and Note 33 – Litigation). - _Employee benefits: assumptions updated annually, such as the probability of personnel remaining with the Group until retirement, the projected change in future compensation, the discount rate and the mortality table (Refer to Note 27 – Post-employment benefits). - _Revenue: identification of the separable elements of a packaged offer and allocation on the basis of the relative fair values of each element; the period of deferred revenue related to costs to access the service on the basis of the type of product and the term of the contract; presentation as net or gross revenue depending on whether the Group is acting as agent or principal (Refer to Note 6 – Financial Key Performance Indicators “KPIs”). - _Fair value of financial instruments Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3: Fair value is determined by reference to the market price at the end of the period, when the data is available.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.277,6.** **Financial Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”),1.277.1,,"The Board of Directors has defined certain financial KPIs that are tracked and reported by each operating segment every month to the senior executives of the Company. The Board of Directors believes that these indicators offer them the best view of the operational and financial efficiency of each segment and this follows best practices in the rest of the industry, thus providing investors and other analysts a suitable base to perform their analysis of the Group’s results. The financial KPIs tracked by the Board of Directors are: - Adjusted EBITDA; - Revenues; - Capital expenditure (“Capex”); and - Operating free cash flow (“OpFCF”). Adjusted EBITDA, Capex and OpFCF are non-GAAP measures. These measures are useful to readers of Altice France’s financial statements as they provide a measure of operating results excluding certain items that Altice France’s management believe are either outside of its recurring operating activities, or items that are non-cash. Excluding such items enables trends in the Group’s operating results and cash flow generation to be more easily observable. The nonGAAP measures are used by the Group internally to manage and assess the results of its operations, make decisions with respect to investments and allocation of resources, and assess the performance of management personnel. Such performance measures are also, de facto, the metrics used by investors and other members of the financial community to value other companies operating in the same industry as the Group and thus are a basis for comparability between the Group and its peers. Moreover, the debt covenants of the Group are based on the Adjusted EBITDA and other associated metrics. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used in the covenant has not changed with the adoption of IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers and IFRS 16 – Leases by the Group. - _Adjusted EBITDA Following the application of IFRS 16, Adjusted EBITDA is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, other expenses and incomes (capital gains, non-recurring litigation, restructuring costs and management fees),share-based expenses and after operating lease expenses (i.e., straight-line recognition of the rent expense over the lease term as performed under IFRS16 for operating lease). This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating income as the effects of depreciation, amortization and impairment, excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, do ultimately affect the operating results. Operating results presented in the annual consolidated financial statements are in accordance with IAS 1 – Presentation of financial statements. - _Capex Capex is an important indicator to follow, as the profile varies greatly between activities: - The fixed business has fixed Capex requirements that are mainly discretionary (network, platforms, general), and variable capex requirements related to the connection of new customers and the purchase of Customer Premise Equipment (TV decoder, modem, etc.). - Mobile Capex is mainly driven by investment in new mobile sites, upgrade to new mobile technology and licenses to operate; once the licences are engaged and the sites operational, there are limited further Capex requirements. - Other Capex is mainly related to costs incurred in acquiring content rights. ----- - _Operating free cash flow OpFCF is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capex. This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. Further, this measure should not be considered as an alternative for operating cash flow as presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with IAS 1 – Presentation of financial _statements._",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The conditions for allocation of assets and liabilities shared by the operating segments are described in Note 2.13 – Impairment of assets. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The value in use is determined by using cash projects based on financial budgets approved by Management covering a five-year period. Projections of subscribers, revenue, costs and capital expenditure are based on reasonable and acceptable assumptions that represent Management’s best estimates. These assumptions are based on the projected number of subscribers, the level of expenses to improve network infrastructures, and the savings related to the continued implementation of the synergies identified by the Group. The projections are based on both past experience and the expected future market penetration of the various products. All these elements have been assigned, either directly or indirectly, to the operating segments of the Group.

The negative value of the equity interests in La Poste Telecom was adjusted to zero by offsetting against provisions totaling €19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. (b) On February 18, 2010, a group comprised of SFR, Vinci and AXA (30% each) and TDF (10%) signed a GSM-R public-private partnership contract with Réseau Ferré de France. This contract, worth a total of one billion euros over a 15-year term, is to finance, build, operate and maintain a digital telecommunications network. Synerail Construction, a subsidiary of Vinci (60%) and SFR (40%), is responsible for the construction of this network. The value of these equity-accounted securities is positive as shown in the table above. (c) SFR FTTH, created in 2019, is a partnership between Altice France and a consortium led by OMERS Infrastructure, AXA IM - Real Assets and Allianz Capital Partners, in order to develop the ”fiber to the home” business within the framework of the private investment zone (AMII / AMEL areas). SFR FTTH is the largest alternative FTTH infrastructure wholesale operator in France with five million homes to be covered within the next four years and more to be franchised or acquired. SFR FTTH is specialized in the design, construction and operation of telecommunications networks and infrastructures for local authorities.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments (cross currency swaps) traded over-the-counter is calculated on the basis of models commonly used by traders to measure these types of instruments. The resulting fair values are checked against bank valuations. The measurement of the fair value of derivative financial instruments includes a “counterparty risk” component for asset derivatives and an “own credit risk” component for liability derivatives. Credit risk is measured using a simplified model derived from Basel II for calculating exposure risk and using market data to determine the probability of default. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the following changes were made to the Group’s derivative instruments: following the partial redemption of its 2024 USD Notes, the Group reallocated part of the cross currency swaps associated with the 2024 USD Notes to the new $840 million Altice Luxembourg Notes. The Group also entered into new cross currency swaps in order to fully hedge the risk on the nominal of new loan. The new allocation/swaps are presented below: - $561 million reallocated from the 2024 USD Notes to the Altice Luxembourg Notes at an average swap rate of 1.2898% with a USD receiving rate of 6.125% and an average Euro paying rate of 5.3427%. - New CCS with a nominal of $200 million/€175 million with a USD receiving rate of 10.5% and a euro paying rate 7.86%. - New CCS with a nominal of $76 million/€69 million with a USD receiving rate of 7.75% and a euro paying rate 4.52%. ----- On September 27, 2019, following the issuance of the new 2028 USD Notes ($1,100 million), intended for the full redemption of the remaining 2024 USD Notes ($815 million), the Group completely restructured the cross currency swaps associated with the 2024 USD Notes. The details are given below: - CCS with certain counterparties were terminated with a nominal exchange. The Group received $496.9 million and paid euros €365.9 million. The Group recognized an exchange gain of €88.4 million (€80.3 million net of break fees). - CCS for a nominal amount of $878.1 million were reset to market conditions and reallocated to the 2028 Notes with a monetization of the latent capital gain. The Group received €116.3 million as part of this restructuring. - The new CCS with a nominal of $76 million referenced above was restructured as well and allocated to the 2028 Notes with a USD receiving rate of 5.5% and a euro paying rate of 2.99%. - A new CCS with Altice Luxembourg S.A., with a received/paid nominal of €175 million/$200 million with a USD paying rate of 10.5% and a euro receiving rate of 7.86%. - Two new CCS were executed and allocated to the 2028 USD Notes: - Nominal of $66.3 million/€59.8 million with a USD receiving rate of 5.5% and a Euro paying rate of 3.35%; - Nominal of $79.6 million/€72.0 million with a USD receiving rate of 5.5% and a Euro paying rate of 3.335%. Following the restructurings described above, the 2028 USD Notes were fully hedged with new CCS with the details given below: - Nominal of $1,100 million/€995.6 million (with an average USD/EUR rate of 1.1049) with a USD receiving rate of 5.5% and an average EUR paying rate of 3.3219%. The Group has chosen not to qualify the new CCS allocated to the 2028 Notes as cash flow hedges.

In July 2015, in the form of an additional facility under the same legal documentation as the loans taken out in May 2014, the Group set up new term loan for the purpose of refinancing its revolving credit lines. Then, in order to fund a portion of the December 2015 distribution, the Group took out a term loan in October 2015. The latter was also structured as an additional tranche under the existing documentation. In April 2016, the Group set up new bonds and term loans for the purpose to refinance a portion of the loans raised in 2014. In October 2016, the Group set up new term loan tranches. The loans setting up in 2016 were structured as additional debt under the existing documentation. In April and October 2017, the Group refinanced some of its term loans and were structured as additional debt under the existing documentation. In July and August 2018, the Group refinanced bonds in euros and dollars with a maturity at 2022. In September 2019, the Group refinanced its USD and EUR notes due in 2024.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.492,32.4.** **Agreement to share part of SFR’s mobile network,1.492.1,,"On January 31, 2014, SFR and Bouygues Telecom signed a strategic agreement to share their mobile networks. They will deploy a new shared-access mobile network in an area covering 57% of the population. The agreement allows the two operators to improve their mobile coverage and to achieve significant savings over time. The agreement is based on two principles: - Create a special purpose joint venture (Infracos) to manage the shared assets of the radio sites, i.e., the passive infrastructures and geographical sites where the telecom infrastructures and equipment are deployed. SFR and Bouygues Telecom each retain full ownership of their own telecom equipment assets and frequencies. - Set up a RAN-sharing service that 2G, 3G and 4G operators can use in the shared territory. Each operator is responsible for the part of the shared territory in which it designs, deploys, operates and maintains the RAN-sharing service. The sharing agreement is similar to many mechanisms set up in other European countries. Each operator retains its own independent innovation capacity and total commercial and pricing independence. The first deliveries of cell plans were on April 30, 2014. On that occasion, each operator was informed of its partner’s deployment plans, as exchanges of technical information about the sites when developing the sharing agreement had been prohibited by ARCEP. This exchange of information led on October 24, 2014 to the agreement being adjusted, in particular regarding certain engineering choices that had been made at a time when the negotiating parties did not have full access to relevant data about each other’s networks. The target network completion date was pushed back to December 31, 2020, to take into account previous deployment delays encountered. The first roll-outs of the RAN sharing coverage were in September 2015, and 11,916 sites were rolled out the end of December 31, 2019. SFR estimates that as of late December 2019, this agreement corresponds to approximately €1,158.0 million in commitments given, and approximately €1,607.0 million in commitments received, for a net commitment of approximately €449.0 million, covering the entire long-term agreement.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

On May 15, 2009, the French Competition Authority decided to postpone its decision and remanded the case for further investigation. On August 18, 2011, SFR received a complaint claiming unfair pricing. On December 13, 2012, the Competition Authority fined SFR €66 million for abuse of dominant position, which SFR has paid. SFR appealed the decision. The case was heard by the Paris Court of Appeal on February 20, 2014. The Paris Court of Appeal rendered its judgment on June 19, 2014, dismissing SFR's appeal (the judgment was appealed to the Court of Cassation, the French Supreme Court, by SFR on July 9, 2014; on October 6, 2015, the Court of Cassation rejected SFR’s appeal) and asked the European Commission to provide an Amicus Curiae to shed light on the economic and legal issues raised by the case. The Court of Appeal postponed ruling on the merits of the case pending the Commission's opinion. The Commission rendered its opinion on December 1[st], 2014, which went against SFR. The Court of Appeal issued its ruling on May 19, 2016; it granted a 20% fine rebate to SFR due to the new nature of the infraction. The French treasury (Trésor Public) returned €13.1 million to SFR. SFR appealed on a point of law on June 20, 2016. As a result of the French Competition Authority's decision of December 13, 2012, Bouygues Telecom, Omea Telecom and EI Telecom (NRJ Mobile) brought suit against SFR in the Commercial Court for damages. In accordance with the transaction between SFR and Bouygues Telecom in June 2014, the closing hearing of the conciliation proceedings was held on December 5, 2014. The motion for discontinuance granted on September 11, 2014 ended the legal action between the two companies. With respect to the claim by Omea Telecom and EI Telecom, SFR applied for stay on a ruling pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal, and obtained it. Omea Telecom withdrew its claim on May ----- 24, 2016. EI Telecom decided to recommence its legal proceedings and updated the amount of its claim. The procedure is pending. eBizcuss.com against Virgin eBizcuss.com filed a complaint against Virgin on April 11, 2012 before the French Competition Authority regarding an anticompetitive vertical agreement between Apple and its wholesale distributors (including Virgin). The case is pending. Complaint against Orange to the Competition Authority regarding the market in mobile telephony services for businesses On August 9, 2010, SFR filed a complaint against Orange with the Competition Authority for anticompetitive practices in the business mobile telephony services market. On March 5, 2015 the Competition Authority sent a notice of complaints to Orange. Four complaints were filed against Orange. On December 17, 2015, the Authority ordered Orange to pay a fine of €350 million. On June 18, 2015, SFR filed suit against Orange in the Commercial Court and is seeking €2.4 billion in damages subject to adjustment as remedy for the loss suffered as a result of the practices in question in the proceedings with the Competition Authority. A hearing on the merits of the case was held in February 2020 regarding in particular the fault committed by Orange and the causal link between such fault and the damages suffered by SFR. A second hearing was held in March 2020 regarding the quantum of the prejudice claimed by SFR. A last hearing is scheduled for April 29, 2020 regarding the potential indexation of the prejudice suffered by SFR. Potential failure to meet commitments made by Altice France as part of the takeover of exclusive control of SFR relating to the agreement signed by SFR and Bouygues Telecom on November 9, 2010 (Faber) Following a complaint from Bouygues Telecom, the Competition Authority officially opened an inquiry on October 5, 2015 to examine the conditions under which Altice France performs its commitments relating to the joint investment agreement entered into with Bouygues Telecom to roll out fiber optics in very densely populated areas. A session before the Competition Authority board was held on November 22, and then on December 7, 2016. On March 8, 2017, the Competition Authority imposed a financial sanction of €40 million against Altice and Altice France, for not having respected the commitments set out in the “Faber Agreement” at the time of the SFR acquisition by NC Numéricable (now SFR Fibre). This amount was recognized in the consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017 and was paid during the second quarter of 2017. The Competition Authority also imposed injunctions (new schedule including levels of achievement, with progressive penalty, in order to supply all the outstanding access points). A summary was lodged on April 13, 2017 before the Council of State. The judge in chambers of the Council of State said there is no matter to be referred. On September 28, 2017, the Council of State rejected the application for cancellation of the decision of the Competition Authority requested by Altice Europe and Altice France Group. The French Competition authority withdrew all of SFR's commitments for the future On October 28, 2019. The control by the French Competition Authority of SFR commitments for the past is still ongoing. As of December 31, 2019, the Group considers that the risk is difficult to estimate reliably and is hence considered to be a contingent liability under IAS 37– Provision, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. SFR against Orange: abuse of dominant position in the second homes market On April 24, 2012, SFR filed a complaint against Orange with the Paris Commercial Court for practices abusing its dominant position in the retail market for mobile telephony services for non-residential customers. On February 12, 2014, the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay to SFR €51 million for abuse of dominant position in the second homes market. On April 2, 2014, Orange appealed the decision of the Commercial Court on the merits. On October 8, 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals overturned the Paris Commercial Court's ruling of February 12, 2014 and dismissed SFR’s requests. The Court of Appeals ruled that it had not been proven that a pertinent market limited to second homes actually exists. In the absence of such a market, there was no exclusion claim to answer, due to the small number of homes concerned. On October 13, 2014 SFR received notification of the judgment of the Paris Court of Appeals of October 8, 2014 and repaid the €51 million to Orange in November 2014. On November 19, 2014, SFR appealed the ruling. On April 12, 2016, the French Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision and referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeal. Orange returned €52.7 million to SFR on May 31, 2016. Orange refilled the case before the Paris Court of Appeal on August 30, 2016. On June 8, 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal rejected Orange’s appeal. On December 24, 2018, Orange refiled an appeal with the Supreme Court. SFR filed its conclusions in defence on February 15, 2019. The case is still pending. SCT against SFR On October 11, 2017, SCT summoned SFR before the Paris Commercial Court for some supposed dysfunctions and multiple failings in the delivery of its fixed services, such as the loss of final clients as part of the supply of mobile services (MVNO). ----- For this reason, SCT asks, on various grounds, for an amount around €48 million. This case was subject to a conciliation proceeding between the parties. After the failure of this proceeding, the case was sent on the merits and the procedure is pending. Free against SFR: unfair practices for non-compliance with consumer credit provisions in a subsidized offer On May 21, 2012, Free filed a complaint against SFR in the Paris Commercial Court. Free challenged the subsidy used in SFR's “Carrés” offers sold over the web between June 2011 and December 2012, claiming that it constituted a form of consumer credit and, as such, SFR was guilty of unfair practices by not complying with the consumer credit provisions, in particular in terms of prior information to customers. Free asked the Paris Commercial Court to require SFR to inform its customers and to order it to pay €29 million in damages. On January 15, 2013, the Commercial Court dismissed all of Free’s requests and granted SFR €0.3 million in damages. On January 31, 2013, Free appealed the decision. On March 9, 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the Paris Commercial Court’s ruling and denied all claims filed by Free. The amount of damages payable by Free to SFR was increased from €0.3 million to €0.5 million. On May 6, 2016, Free filed an appeal. The court of cassation rendered a decision on March 7, 2018.This decision overturned and partially cancelled the decision rendered by the Court of Appeal and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Cassation considered that the Paris Court of Appeal had based its prior judgment on improper motives to exclude the mobile subsidy provided by SFR on its subscriptions from the scope of consumer credit. In addition, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed the sentencing for Free mobile to pay €0.5 million for the defamation suffered by SFR. On April 24, 2019, the Court of Appeal considered that disputed “Carrés” offers have to be considered as consumer credit and that SFR is consequently liable for unfair commercial practices during the litigation period. However, the Court dismissed Free from its other claims and an expertise has been requested by the Court to determine the damage suffered by Free. This expertise is pending. SFR against Iliad, Free and Free mobile: unfair competition by disparagement On May 27, 2014, SFR filed a complaint against Iliad, Free and Free Mobile in the Paris Commercial Court for unfair competition claiming that when Free Mobile was launched and afterwards, Iliad, Free and Free Mobile were guilty of disparaging SFR services. SFR claimed €493 million in damages. On September 9, 2016 by pleadings on counterclaims, Free requested the court to judge that SFR denigrated their capacities and services and claimed €475 million in damages. The Paris Commercial Court rendered its judgment on January 29, 2018. The Court sentenced Free Mobile to pay to SFR €20 million as moral damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. In addition, the court sentenced SFR to pay to Free Mobile €25 million as moral and material damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. Accordingly, the court sentenced, as compensation, SFR to pay to Free Mobile €5 million as damages. This decision was executed and the Group paid the €5 million net amount to Free Mobile in June 2018. SFR appealed this decision. The case is still pending. Disputes regarding the transfer of customer call centres from Toulouse, Lyon and Poitiers Following the transfer of customer call centres from Toulouse and Lyon to the company Infomobile and the Poitiers call centres to a subsidiary of the Bertelsmann Group, the former employees at those sites filed legal actions at Labor Tribunals in each city to penalize what they claim were unfair employment contracts constituting fraud under Article L. 1224-1 of the French Labour Code and also contravening the legal provisions regarding dismissal for economic reasons. The rulings in 2013 were mixed as the Toulouse Court of Appeal penalized SFR and Téléperformance in half of the cases while the Lyon and Poitiers courts ruled in favor of SFR. The cases are now at different stages of proceedings: Labour Tribunal, Court of Appeals and Court of Cassation. Litigation over distribution in the independent network (Consumer market and SFR Business Team) SFR, like companies operating an indirect distribution model, faces complaints from a certain number of its distributors and almost routinely from former distributors. Such recurring complaints revolve around claims of sudden breach of contractual relations, abuse of economic dependency and/or demands for requalification as a sales agent as well as, more recently, demands for requalification as a contractual branch manager and requalification as SFR contracted point of sale staff. Free against SFR In July 2015, Free filed suit against SFR in order to stop it from using the word “Fibre” claiming that the solution marketed by SFR is not a fibre to the home (FTTH) solution. Free considers SFR’s communication to be deceptive about substantial qualities and, on that basis, is asking the court to find there is parasitism and unfair competition. ----- On January 19, 2018, the court rendered a decision. The decision condemned SFR to: - €1 million as moral damages; - Communicate, within 90 days following the date of the judgment notification, to each client having subscribed to SFR or SFR Fibre, of an offer including the term « fibre » (excluding FTTH offers) on IT support and paper support information relating to: i) the precise nature of its connection to optical fibre ii) the number of subscribers sharing coaxial connection and iii) the average connection speed at peak hours and off-peak hours. - Inform, within 90 days following the date of the judgment notification, each client having subscribed to SFR or SFR Fibre to an offer including the term « fibre » (excluding FFTH offers) that they benefit from a possibility of immediate termination to default of previous information about the exact characteristics of the offer. - €0.1 million as article 700 of the Civil Proceedings Code. The court considered having made a material error in failing to mention provisional enforcement in the judgment. Accordingly, the court decided, by the judgment dated February 12, 2018, the provisional enforcement for all convictions in this case. Despite its appeal before the Court of Appeal of Paris, SFR was obliged to execute the judgment. Free challenged SFR's proper execution of the judgment and referred the matter to the enforcement judge, which confirmed the proper execution of the ruling by SFR. Free decided to appeal this judgment and the proceedings are still pending. In-depth inquiry of the European Commission into the assignment of cable infrastructures by certain local authorities On July 17, 2013, the European Commission signalled that it had decided to open an investigation to verify whether the transfer of public cable infrastructure between 2003 and 2006 by several French municipalities to SFR Fibre was consistent with European Union government aid rules. In announcing the opening of this in-depth investigation, the European Commission indicated that it believes that the sale of public assets to a private company without proper compensation gives the latter an economic advantage not enjoyed by its competitors, and that it therefore constitutes government aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union and that the free-of-charge transfer of the cable networks and ducts by 33 French municipalities to SFR Fibre, they have argued, confers a benefit of this type and, as such, is government aid. The Group strongly denies the existence of any governmental aids. Action by Colt, Free and Orange in the General Court of the European Union concerning the DSP 92 project Colt, Free and Orange, in three separate motions filed against the European Commission before the General Court of the European Union seeking to annul the European Commission’s final decision of September 30, 2009 (Decision C (2009) 7426), which held that the compensation of €59 million granted for the establishment and operation of a highspeed electronic communications network in the department of Hauts-de-Seine does not constitute government aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union. The Group is not party to this proceeding. Its subsidiary Sequalum is acting as the civil party, as well as the French government and the department of Hauts-de-Seine. In three rulings dated September 16, 2013, the General Court of the European Union rejected the requests of the three applicants and confirmed the aforementioned decision of the European Commission. Free and Orange have appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union. The procedure is pending. Litigation between Sequalum and CG 92 regarding DSP 92 A disagreement arose between the Hauts-de-Seine General Council (“CG92”) and Sequalum regarding the terms of performance of a utilities public service concession contract (“THD Seine”) signed on March 13, 2006 between Sequalum, a subsidiary of the Group, and the Hauts-de-Seine General Council; the purpose of this delegation was to create a very-high-speed fibre optic network in the Hauts-de-Seine region. The Hauts-de-Seine General Council meeting of October 17, 2014 decided to terminate the public service delegation agreement signed with Sequalum “for misconduct by the delegatee for whom it is solely responsible”. Pursuant to two decisions rendered on March 16, 2017, the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise rejected the actions brought by Sequalum against two enforcement measures issued by the department of Hauts-de-Seine in respect of penalties, for amounts of €51.6 million and €45.1 million. Sequalum appealed the two decisions before the Administrative Court of Versailles, but paid the amount of €97 million over the month of July 2017. Sequalum claims that the termination was unlawful and continued to perform the contract, subject to any demands that the delegator may impose. Should the competent courts confirm this interpretation of unlawful termination, Sequalum may primarily have (i) to repay the public subsidies received for the DSP 92 project, normally the outstanding component of the subsidies (the company received €25 million in subsidies from the General Council), (ii) to reimburse any deferred income (estimated at €32 million by the Department) and (iii) to compensate the Department for any losses suffered (amount estimated by the Department of €212 million). In turn, the department of Hauts-de-Seine received the returnable assets of the DSP on July 1, 2015. Furthermore, the General Council will have to pay compensation to Sequalum, which essentially corresponds to the net value of the assets. On October 16, 2014, Sequalum filed a motion in the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise requesting the termination of the public service concession because of force majeure residing in the irreversible disruption of the structure of the contract, with the resulting payment of compensation in Sequalum’s favour. At December 31, 2015, the assets were removed from ----- Sequalum’s accounts in the amount of €116 million. Income receivable in the amount of €139 million related to the expected indemnification was also recognized, an amount fully depreciated given the situation. On July 11, 2016, the department of Hauts-de-Seine established a breakdown of all amounts due (in its opinion) by each Party for the various disputes, and issued demands based on said breakdown. Each amount was subject to a decision by the public accountant dated July 13, 2016 (final amount established by the latter for a net amount of €181.6 million, taking into account the carrying amount due in his opinion to Sequalum). This breakdown, the various demands and the compensation decision were subject to applications for annulment filed by Sequalum with the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise on September 10, 12 and 14, 2016. These applications remain pending, except for the application for annulment relating to the breakdown (the court having considered that the breakdown was not a measure which could be appealed. Sequalum appealed this decision before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeals). Altice France outlined that it had its own optical fiber in the Haut-de-Seine department enabling it to serve its customers. In September 2017, the department issued three revenue orders (titres de recette) in order to minimize the balance due to Sequalum at the time of counting. These demands were contested: - Order of an amount of €23.2 million for the unamortized portion of the subsidies: SFR’s appeal dismissed; - Order of an amount of €31.9 million for deferred income: successful appeal for SFR; - Order of an amount of €5.7 million for amounts received as prepayment for connections: SFR’s appeal dismissed. The Department issued a revenue order of €212 million for damages suffered as a result of the faults based on which the contract was terminated. The judgment was rendered on February 15, 2018. It reduces the indemnity by €187 million and reduces, correlatively, the amount of the revenue order to €26 million. The department appealed this judgment; the judgment rendered on July 5, 2018 granted Sequalum's request for cancellation of the compensation. On the other hand, the request for repayment was rejected. This rejection was appealed. Claim from Free concerning the acquisition of Virgin Mobile by the Group On April 5, 2019, Altice France and Altice Luxembourg, inter alios, received a claim from Free stating that the practices sanctioned by the French Competition Authority in November 2016 in the SFR Fibre/SFR/Virgin Mobile gun jumping case caused said Free to lose the tender process for the acquisition of Virgin Mobile. Free is now seeking €216 million in monetary damages. Altice France is now expected to produce its conclusions in defence on May 15, 2020. Altice France requested from the judge to require from Free some of documents that will help Altice France to understand the damages suffered and the amount claimed by Free. At this stage, the Group strongly challenges the merits of this claim. Litigation arising from the voluntary redundancy plan of 2017 In the context of the voluntary redundancy plan initiated in 2017 by the Group, certain former employees have introduced claims before the “Conseils de Prud’hommes” (labour law ombudsman) based on the breach of the legal provisions in the French Labour code applicable to lay-off for economic reasons. The Group contested the foundation of these claims and decisions were rendered in favour of the Group. Several cases are still pending.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.507,Closed litigation,1.507.1,,"Dispute with Orange concerning certain IRUs The Group signed four non-exclusive IRUs with Orange on May 6, 1999, May 18, 2001, July 2, 2004 and December 21, 2004, in connection with the Group’s acquisition of certain companies operating cable networks built by Orange. These cable networks, accessible only through the civil engineering installations of Orange (mainly its ducts), are made available to the Group by Orange through these non-exclusive IRUs. Each of these IRUs covers a different geographic area and was signed for a term of 20 years. Following ARCEP’s Decision 2008-0835 of July 24, 2008, Orange published, on September 15, 2008, a technical and commercial offer made to telecommunication operators allowing them access to the civil engineering infrastructures of the local wire-based network, pursuant to which the operators can roll out their own fiber networks in Orange’s ducts. The terms of this mandatory technical and commercial offer are more restrictive than the terms that the Group enjoys under the Orange IRUs. As a result, in December 2011, SFR Fibre and Orange signed amendments to the IRUs in order to comply with the November 4, 2010 ARCEP decision and to align the operating procedures set out in the IRUs with the procedures set out in the Orange general technical and commercial offer. Lastly, SFR Fibre initiated parallel proceedings against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris on October 7, 2010 claiming damages of €2.7 billion for breach and modification of the IRUs by Orange. On April 23, 2012, the Commercial Court of Paris ruled in favor of Orange and dismissed the Group’s claims for damages, ruling that there were no material differences between the original operational procedures and the new operational procedures imposed on SFR Fibre by Orange under the terms of its general technical and commercial offer, published on September 15, 2008. SFR Fibre appealed this decision before the Paris Court of Appeals and claimed the same amount of damages as it had before the Paris Commercial Court. Orange, in turn, claims that this proceeding materially ----- impaired its brand and image, and is seeking an order to make SFR Fibre pay damages of €50 million. In a ruling dated June 20, 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals dismissed SFR Fibre’s appeal, which was referred to the Court of Cassation on August 14, 2014. On February 2, 2015, the Court of Cassation set aside the ruling of the Paris Court of Appeals except in that it recognized SFR Fibre’s interest in acting and referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeals. The Paris Court of Appeal, in its judgment of 16 June 2017, rejected SFR Fibre’s claims. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Cassation in a judgment of 27 March 2019, thus putting a definitive end to this case. Tracetel and Intermobility against SFR: Velib In May 2017, Tracetel and Intermobility sued SFR before the “Tribunal de Commerce de Paris” in order to obtain compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the two contracting parties in the context of the response to the tender procedure of the Vélib DSP. They accuse SFR of not having filed the joint offer and are asking for the sentencing of SFR to the tune of €76.7 million for loss of tender. To date, the Group is challenging the merits of these claims. In November 2018, at the time of the submission of summary conclusions, Tracetel and Intermobility requested that, in the event of rejection of their principal claim, the Group will be ordered to pay a minimum of €2.5 million. The judgment was delivered on December 16, 2019 and ordered SFR to pay €0.4 million with a provisional execution of the judgment ordered. Tracetel and Intermobility did not appeal the judgment within the appeal period. This case is therefore definitively closed. Canal Plus Group (GCP) against SFR and SFR Fibre (ex NC Numericable) On October 4, 2017, GCP summoned SFR and SFR Fibre before Paris Commercial Court. GCP claimed that both SFR and SFR Fibre breached their contractual obligations and notably: - the marketing of substitute products to the GCP allowing customer poaching from GCP offers to the benefit of « Altice » offers ; - the decrease of GCP’s offers promotions ; - the promotion of migration of the subscribers base in favor of FTTB offer, which does not allow access to Canalsat offer ; - misleading advertising on contents (ex : « Le Grand Football est chez SFR ») ; - the refusal to set up new offers ; - the modification of the GCP channels numbering ; - the GCP channels denigration on SC platforms. GCP requested the termination of the above under financial penalty of thirty thousand euros per day, and damages in the amount of €174 million. On September 18, 2018, the two parties signed a contract allowing GCP to distribute sports channels produced by the Group via satellite. As part of this agreement, both parties decided to mutually desist from all open legal proceedings, thus ending the aforementioned litigation. Claim by Bouygues Telecom against SFR Fibre (ex NC Numericable) and Completel In late October 2013, SFR Fibre and Completel received a claim from Bouygues Telecom regarding the “white label” contract signed on May 14, 2009, initially for five years and extended once for an additional five years for the supply to Bouygues Telecom of double- and triple-play very-high-speed offers. In its letter, Bouygues Telecom claimed damages totaling €53 million because of this contract. Bouygues Telecom alleges a loss that, according to Bouygues Telecom, justifies damages including (i) €17.3 million for alleged pre-contractual fraud (providing erroneous information prior to signing the contract), (ii) €33.3 million for alleged non-performance by the Group companies of their contractual obligations and (iii) €2.4 million for alleged damage to Bouygues Telecom’s image. The Group considers these claims unfounded both in fact and in contractual terms, and rejects both the allegations of Bouygues Telecom and the amount of damages claimed. On July 24, 2015, Bouygues Telecom filed suit against SFR Fibre and Completel concerning the performance of the contract to supply very-high-speed links (2P/3P). Bouygues Telecom is accusing SFR Fibre and Completel of abusive practices, deceit and contractual faults, and is seeking nullification of certain provisions of the contract and indemnification of €79 million. On June 21, 2016, Bouygues Telecom filed revised pleadings, increasing its claims for indemnification to a total of €180 million. In addition, in a counter-claim, SFR Fibre and Completel are seeking €10.8 million in addition to the contractual interest as well as €24 million in royalties due for fiscal years 2015, 2016 et 2017. ----- SFR Fibre and Completel have made a new counterclaim based on the abrupt termination of business relations for an amount up to €32.6 million. SFR Fibre and Completel have filed their pleadings on January 30, 2018. On December 5, 2018, the Group concluded a settlement with Bouygues Telecom in order to close this litigation. Bouygues Telecom against SFR (Faber CCI) On October 19, 2017, Bouygues Telecom submitted a request for arbitration to the secretary of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) relating to a disagreement regarding the Faber Agreement between Bouygues Telecom and SFR. Bouygues Telecom claims that SFR breached certain contractual duties and commitments made before the French Competition Authority relating to the Faber Agreement (namely, certain delays and not having connected certain categories of buildings, thereby causing damage to Bouygues Telecom).The Arbitration court has been setup and proceeding began in May 2018. In a document dated June 15, 2018, Bouygues Telecom alleged that it has suffered prejudices amounting to €164.9 million. The Group fully disputed these claims. The Group presented its counter claims on October 15, 2018 and prepared the estimate of its own prejudice suffered and analyzed the prejudice mentioned by Bouygues Telecom in collaboration with an independent expert. As of September 30, 2018, the Group considered that the risk was difficult to estimate reliably and was hence considered to be a contingent liability under IAS 37. On December 5, 2018, SFR and Bouygues reached a settlement agreement through which both parties agreed to mutually put an end to the Faber disputes. As part of the agreement, both parties agreed to draw up new guidelines for the deployment of the fiber network under the terms of the Faber contract. Bouygues Telecom also agreed to cease and desist its proceedings before the ICC Arbitration Court. Bouygues Telecom received a one-off indemnity as part of the settlement, amounting to an aggregate amount of € 58 million. Complaint by Orange Réunion and Orange Mayotte against SRR and SFR _Differential on-net/off-net pricing in the mobile telephony market in Mayotte and Réunion_ Orange Réunion, Orange Mayotte and Outremer Telecom filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority in June 2009 alleging unfair differential on-net/off-net pricing by SRR in the mobile telephony market on Mayotte and Réunion seeking conservatory measures from the Competition Authority. On September 15, 2009, the French Competition Authority announced provisional measures against SRR, pending its decision on the merits. SRR had to discontinue any price spread exceeding its actual ""off-net/on-net"" costs in the network concerned. As the French Competition Authority found that SRR had not fully complied with its injunction, it fined SRR €2 million on January 24, 2012. In the proceedings on the merits, with regard to the “Consumers” component of the case, SRR requested and obtained a “no contest” on the complaints on July 31, 2013. On June 13, 2014, the Authority rendered its decision for the “Consumers” component of the case, fining SFR and its subsidiary SRR €45.9 million. On June 18, 2018, the Group agreed on a settlement with Orange, whereby both parties mutually agreed to desist from certain ongoing legal provisions. _Compensation disputes_ Following the Competition Authority's decision of September 15, 2009 (provisional measures) and pending the Authority's decision on the merits, on June 17, 2013, Outremer Telecom filed suit against SRR and SFR in the Commercial Court seeking remedy for the loss it believes it suffered as a result of SRR’s practices. Outremer Telecom claimed €23.5 million in damages subject to adjustment for unfair practices by SRR in the consumer market in mobile telephony on Réunion and Mayotte, and €1 million as damages in full for unfair practices by SRR in the business market in mobile telephony on Réunion and Mayotte. Outremer withdrew from the proceedings against SRR and SFR on May 10, 2015. On October 8, 2014, Orange Reunion sued SRR and SFR jointly and severally to pay €135.3 million for the loss suffered because of the practices sanctioned by the Competition Authority. Various procedural issues have been raised, on which a judgment is pending. The Court rendered its ruling on June 20, 2016 stating that the petitions of Orange Réunion cannot relate to the period preceding October 8, 2009 and therefore refused to exonerate SFR. On December 20, 2016, following the Court’s judgment, Orange updated its estimate of the loss it believes it suffered after October 8, 2009 and reached the amount of €88 million (which represents the non-time-barred portion of the alleged loss). As part of the agreement described above, on June 18, 2018, Orange has agreed to close this litigation. ----- Orange suit against SFR in the Paris Commercial Court (overflows case) Orange filed a claim on August 10, 2011 with the Paris Commercial Court asking the Court to order SFR to immediately cease its unfair ""overflow"" practices and to order SFR to pay €309.5 million in contractual penalties. It accused SFR of deliberately organizing overflows onto the Orange network for the purpose of economically optimizing its own network (under designing the Primary Digital Block (PBN)). In a ruling of December 10, 2013, the Court ordered SFR to pay Orange €22.1 million. SFR and Orange both appealed the ruling. On January 16, 2015 the Paris Court of Appeals upheld the Commercial Court’s ruling and SFR paid the €22.1 million. On January 13, 2017, SFR appealed the ruling. On August 11, 2014, SFR also petitioned the District Court enforcement judge, who rendered his decision on May 18, 2015 by ordering SFR to pay €0.6 million (assessment of penalty for 118 abusive overflows). On July 24, 2017, Orange summoned SFR before the Paris Commercial Court in order to obtain the payment of €11.8 million by application of contractual penalty clauses concerning misbehaviors between July 2011 and July 2014. At the same date, Orange summoned Completel before the same Court, for the same reasons and basis, but for an amount of €9.7 million. By pleadings dated January 30, 2018, SFR and Completel asked for a ruling deferment in order to await the Court of Cassation judgment. As part of the agreement described above, on June 18, 2018, Orange has agreed to close this litigation.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In this context and following regulatory requirements published by governments over the last weeks in countries in which the Group operates, the Group continues to assess conditions in order to adapt to the business and social environment in which it operates. The COVID-19 pandemic can have an adverse effect on the Group’s business, financial condition and results of operations, depending on the nature and period of governmental measures in the countries in which the Group operates. Impacts may include: - The slowdown of the production capabilities of China or other affected countries may have a negative impact on hardware, software and other providers of outsourced services that the Group relies on to provide its services, and the global reach of the pandemic may lead to a situation where there are no clear or cost effective alternatives; - Delay in infrastructural projects; - Productivity of the workforce may decline due to an increase in sick leaves, quarantine procedures and work or travel restrictions; - Habits and financial situation of customers may change due to the economic slowdown and possibility of a worldwide recession, e.g., postponing purchase decisions, breaking contracts and personal or corporate bankruptcies. The Group has activated a response program in order to minimize the impact of this risk, by protecting employees, securing the supply chain, and continuously monitoring the situation and leveraging at the same time the Group’s services that may help in the virus containment efforts, such as videoconferencing and online classes. In addition, networks play a key role in keeping people connected and the Group is monitoring its network usage and assessing its policies and procedures to best support its customers. As of the date of issuance of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group is facing a decline in handsets sales (low margin activity) in the context of the closure of its shops, some delays in the construction of FTTH homes passed and a decline in the advertising businesses (NextRadioTV); but the impact has been limited since the crisis only began at the beginning of March 2020. The situation continues to evolve, including further regulatory requirements published by governments, and it is difficult to predict the effect on the Group’s operations and financial performance. Based on the information above, the Group considers that the assessment of the going concern assumption for the Group is not impacted. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.563,IFRS 16 – Leases,1.563.1,,"IFRS 16 – Leases, issued in January 2016, is the new standard on lease accounting and will result in almost all operating leases being recognized in the balance sheet, as the distinction between operating and finance leases is removed for lessees. Under the new standard, which will become effective on January 1, 2019, an asset (the right to use the leased item) and a financial liability (a liability for discounted minimum lease payments over the lease term) are recognized in the statement of financial position. The accounting for lessors will not significantly change. The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the group’s operating leases and will have a material impact on the consolidated statement of financial position, but it will not have a material impact on the income. The most significant impact will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases qualifying as operating lease under the new standard (IFRS 16 Leases), while accounting for leases qualifying as finance lease under the current standard remains substantially unchanged. Most of the lease commitments that will be in scope of the standard relate to mobile sites (land, space in cell towers or rooftop, agreement with towers company), network infrastructure (including local loop unbundling), buildings used for administrative, commercial or technical purposes and other assets (vehicles). Judgment is required in the determination of the discount rates and the assessment of the lease term (considering renewal or termination options). From a lessor perspective, the standard will not have a material impact as the distinction between operating and finance leases will remain under the new standard. The group has decided to apply the new standard based on the modified retrospective approach (cumulative catchup) and to measure the asset at an amount equal to the liability (adjusted for accruals and prepayments). Therefore, 2018 financial statements will not be restated under the new standard. As regards the options and exemptions permitted under IFRS 16, the Group will take the following approach: - Right-of-use assets will be reported separately in the statement of financial position; - The recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of IFRS 16 will also be applied in full to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets; - A distinction will be made in leases that contain both lease components and non-lease components except for agreements for which the separation is impracticable (master service agreements with towers Company); ----- - Application of the portfolio approach for the recognition and measurements of certain asset categories with similar characteristics (same residual value, same economic environment), mainly for local loop unbundling; - Application of the standard to contracts that were previously identified as finance leases under IAS 17 / IFRIC 4 at the transition date (carry forward of existing finance lease liabilities); - Calculate outstanding liability for existing operating leases using the incremental borrowing rate at date of transition; - IFRS 16 will not be applied to leases for intangible assets; - The Group chooses to apply the relief option, which allows it to adjust the right of use asset by the amount of any provision for onerous leases recognized in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application. Our preliminary assessment of the impact of IFRS 16 on the Group’s balance sheet as at December 31, 2018 is mainly an increase of the right-of-use assets in counterpart of an increase in the lease liabilities relating to previous operating lease in a range of €3.0 - €3.4 billion. In addition, the group is assessing the impact of the current discussions at the IFRIC (IFRS Interpretation committee) relating to sub-surfacing rights that can change the IFRS 16 impacts presented above. During 2019, the Group will record depreciation charges and interest expense (rather than lease expense) in the income statement. In the statement of cash flows, the repayment portion of the lease liabilities from existing operating leases will reduce net cash from or used in financing activities and no longer affect net cash from operating activities. Under IAS 17 – Leases, the undiscounted expected operating lease payments are disclosed as off-balance sheet commitments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (refer to Note 32 – _Commitments and _contractual obligations). This disclosure is only indicative for the size of the IFRS 16 – Lease liability, since in_ this disclosure anticipated renewals are ignored, the amounts are undiscounted, and new contracts previously not recognized as a lease could now be in scope and vice versa. The reconciliation between operating lease commitments as at December 31, 2018 and lease liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position at the date of initial application is presented below: - The operating lease obligations as at December 31, 2018 amounts to €2.0 billion - The effect of the revision of the periods under IFRS 16 (renewal options that are reasonably certain are taken into account under IFRS 16 versus minimum lease payments in IAS 17 disclosure) will increase the operating lease obligations by €1.6 billion - The effect of the discounting effect will decrease the operating lease obligations including revision of the periods by €0.5 billion - Other effects under finalization will impact the operating lease obligations under IFRS 16 in a range of €(0.2) - €0.2 billion.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences on the closing date between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: (i) the initial recognition of goodwill, (ii) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and (iii) investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and when it is probable that these temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, in accordance with the rules in effect at the reporting date.

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date of execution of a derivative contract, and are subsequently revalued at their fair value on each closing date. As allowed under IFRS 9, the Group continues to apply the requirement of IAS 39 related to hedge accounting. Hedge accounting is applicable if: - The hedging relationship is clearly defined and documented at the date of establishment; - The effectiveness of the hedging relationship is demonstrated at its inception and in subsequent periods: i.e., if at the beginning of the hedge and throughout its duration, the Group expects that the changes in fair value of the hedged item will be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, and if actual results are within a range between 80% and 125%. There are three types of hedge accounting: - The fair value hedge is a hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, which are attributable to a rate and/or currency risk and which would affect the result. The hedged portion of these items is remeasured at fair value in the statement of financial position. The change in fair value is recognized in the income statement where it is offset within the limits of the effectiveness of the hedge by symmetrical changes in the fair value of hedging instruments; - The cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to cash flow fluctuations attributable to interest rate risk and/or changes associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (e.g., an expected sale or purchase) and could affect profit. The hedged item is not recorded in the statement of financial position; thus the effective portion of the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or is reclassified in the initial cost of the hedged item where it concerns covering acquisition cost of a non-financial asset; - The net investment hedge is a hedge against exposure to changes in value attributable to the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation that could affect profit when the investment is sold. The effective portion of net investment hedges is recognized through other comprehensive income and reclassified in profit or loss when the net investment is sold. The cessation of hedge accounting may result in particular from the elimination of the hedged item, voluntary termination of the hedging relationship, or the cancelation or maturity of the hedging instrument. The accounting consequences are as follows: - For fair value hedges: the fair value adjustment of debt at the date of cessation of the hedging relationship is amortized based on a recalculated effective interest rate on that date; - For cash flow hedges: the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified into profit or loss when the hedged item is eliminated. In other cases, they are taken straight to profit or loss over the remaining term of the hedging relationship as originally defined.

The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The value in use is determined by using cash projects based on financial budgets approved by Management covering a five-year period. Projections of subscribers, revenue, costs and capital expenditure are based on reasonable and acceptable assumptions that represent Management’s best estimates. These assumptions are based on the projected number of subscribers, the level of expenses to improve network infrastructures, and the savings related to the continued implementation of the synergies identified by the Group. The projections are based on both past experience and the expected future market penetration of the various products. All these elements have been assigned, either directly or indirectly, to the operating segments of the Group.

This subsidiary is a virtual mobile operator in the retail mobile telephony market under the trademark La Poste Mobile. The negative value of the equity interests in La Poste Telecom was adjusted to zero by offsetting against provisions totaling €13.0 million at year-end 2018. b) On February 18, 2010, a group comprised of SFR, Vinci and AXA (30% each) and TDF (10%) signed a GSM-R public-private partnership contract with Réseau Ferré de France. This contract, worth a total of one billion euros over a 15-year term, is to finance, build, operate and maintain a digital telecommunications network to provide voice and data communication between trains and ground control teams in conference mode. The network will be rolled out gradually on 14,000 km of traditional and highspeed rail lines in France. Synerail Construction, a subsidiary of Vinci (60%) and SFR (40%), is responsible for the construction of this network. The value of these equity-accounted securities is positive as shown in the table above. c) SFR and Vinci Immobilier, a subsidiary of Vinci Group, have four subsidiaries in common which they own 50:50 – Foncière Rimbaud 1, Foncière Rimbaud 2, Foncière Rimbaud 3 and Foncière Rimbaud 4 – as part of the construction of SFR’s headquarters in Saint-Denis. This project was completed in two tranches. The first tranche of buildings carried by Foncière Rimbaud 1 and Foncière Rimbaud 2 was delivered in late 2013. The second tranche carried by Foncière Rimbaud 3 and Foncière Rimbaud 4 was delivered in the last quarter of 2015.

They will deploy a new shared-access mobile network in an area covering 57% of the population. The agreement allows the two operators to improve their mobile coverage and to achieve significant savings over time. The agreement is based on two principles: - create a special purpose joint venture (Infracos) to manage the shared assets of the radio sites, i.e., the passive infrastructures and geographical sites where the telecom infrastructures and equipment are deployed. SFR and Bouygues Telecom each retain full ownership of their own telecom equipment assets and frequencies; - set up a RAN-sharing service that 2G, 3G and 4G operators can use in the shared territory. Each operator is responsible for the part of the shared territory in which it designs, deploys, operates and maintains the RANsharing service. The sharing agreement is similar to many mechanisms set up in other European countries. Each operator retains its own independent innovation capacity and total commercial and pricing independence. The first deliveries of cell plans were on April 30, 2014. On that occasion, each operator was informed of its partner’s deployment plans, as exchanges of technical information about the sites when developing the sharing agreement had been prohibited by ARCEP. This exchange of information led on October 24, 2014 to the agreement being adjusted, in particular regarding certain engineering choices that had been made at a time when the negotiating parties did not have full access to relevant data about each other’s networks. The target network completion date was pushed back by a year, from the end of 2017 to the end of 2018, to take into account previous deployment delays encountered. The first roll-outs of the RAN sharing coverage were in September 2015, and 11,591 sites were rolled out the end of December 31, 2018. SFR estimates that as of late December 2018, this agreement corresponds to approximately €1,193.9 million in commitments given, and approximately €1,664.8 million in commitments received, for a net commitment of approximately €470.9 million, covering the entire long-term agreement. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

(iv) SFR must, jointly with the other holders of 800 MHz band licenses, cover the city centers identified by the public authorities in the “Zones blanches” program (more than 98% of the population) within no more than 15 years. As part of the allocation of the third block of LTE frequencies in December 2015 (700 MHz) SFR undertook to comply with the following deployment obligation in very-high-speed mobile networks: - Coverage of the primary deployment area: SFR must cover 50% of the population in this area by January 2022, 92% by January 2027 and 97.7% by December 2030 (this obligation is to comply using 700 MHz frequencies); - Coverage of high-priority roads (about 50,000 kilometers) : SFR must cover 100% of these axes by December 2030 (this obligation is to comply using 700 MHz frequencies); - Coverage of regional railway network (at national level) : at national level, SFR must comply with a 60% coverage rate of regional railway network by January 2022, 80% by January 2027 and 90% by December 2030; - Coverage of regional railway network (at regional level); in each region, SFR must comply with a 60% - coverage rate of regional railway network by January 2027 and 80% by December 2030. In the context of the change of its current frequency authorizations in the 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2.1 GHz bands (and in exchange for the lifting of technological limitation of frequency use in the 900 MHz band), SFR undertook to respect the following obligations: - Participation in the targeted coverage to increase coverage of the metropolitan area; - Widespread access to very high speed mobile access from all sites in its network in December 2020 (and by exception 75% of existing ""Zones blanches"" sites as of July 1, 2018); - Coverage of priority roads outside the vehicles in December 2020; - On-demand coverage inside buildings; - Provide a fixed Internet access service on its very high speed mobile network; - Participation in the extension of the ""4G fixed"" coverage. On November 15, 2018, ARCEP adopted the decision related to the result of the allocation procedure in the 900 MHz band and the 4 decisions authorizing the use of frequencies in the 900 MHz, 1800 MHz and 2.1 GHz bands allocated to the winners selected on October 23, 2018. The new authorization for the use of frequencies delivered to SFR is part of the New Deal mobile, occurred between the Government, ARCEP and operators in January 2018. This authorization is granted from March 25, 2021 until March 24, 2031. It is accompanied by ambitious obligations for the digital development of the territory. In particular, SFR is committed to: - Improve reception’s quality in all the territory, especially in rural areas. The new standard of requirement applied to operators’ obligations is the one of a good coverage; - Increase the pace of targeted programs to improve coverage and in this context build at least 5,000 new sites in all the territory, sometimes pooled, which will now go beyond the ""Zones blanches"" and whose charge is now fully taken by the operators; - Generalize reception in 4G which implies for the operators to cover more than one million French people out of 10,000 communes, by equipping in 4G all the mobile sites; ----- - Accelerate the coverage of transport routes, in order that the main roads and railways are covered in 4G; - Generalize telephone coverage inside buildings, especially by offering its customers equipped with a compatible terminal the voice by Wi-Fi.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.867,33.2.** **Civil and commercial disputes Litigation on progress,1.867.1,,"Complaint by Bouygues Telecom against SFR and Orange regarding the wholesale market in mobile call termination and the retail market in mobile telephony The French Competition Council received a complaint from Bouygues Telecom against SFR and Orange claiming that the latter were engaged in anticompetitive practices in the mobile call termination and mobile telephony markets. On May 15, 2009, the French Competition Authority decided to postpone its decision and remanded the case for further investigation. On August 18, 2011, SFR received a complaint claiming unfair pricing. On December 13, 2012, the Competition Authority fined SFR €66 million for abuse of dominant position, which SFR has paid. SFR appealed the decision. The case was heard by the Paris Court of Appeal on February 20, 2014. The Paris Court of Appeal rendered its judgment on June 19, 2014, dismissing SFR's appeal (the judgment was appealed to the Court of Cassation, the French Supreme Court, by SFR on July 9, 2014; on October 6, 2015, the Court of Cassation rejected SFR’s appeal) and asked the European Commission to provide an Amicus Curiae to shed light on the economic and legal issues raised by the case. The Court of Appeal postponed ruling on the merits of the case pending the Commission's opinion. The Commission rendered its opinion on December 1, 2014, which went against SFR. The Court of Appeal issued its ruling on May 19, 2016; it granted a 20% fine rebate to SFR due to the new nature of the infraction. The French treasury (Trésor Public) returned €13.1 million to SFR. SFR appealed on a point of law on June 20, 2016. As a result of the French Competition Authority's decision of December 13, 2012, Bouygues Telecom, Omea Telecom and EI Telecom (NRJ Mobile) brought suit against SFR in the Commercial Court for damages. In accordance with the transaction between SFR and Bouygues Telecom in June 2014, the closing hearing of the conciliation proceedings was held on December 5, 2014. The motion for discontinuance granted on September 11, 2014 ended the legal action between the two companies. With respect to the claim by Omea Telecom (€67.9 million) and EI Telecom (€28.6 million), SFR applied for stay on a ruling pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal, and obtained it. Omea withdrew on May 24, 2016. EI Telecom decided to recommence its legal proceedings and updated its loss to €28.4 million. The procedure is pending. ----- eBizcuss.com against Virgin eBizcuss.com filed a complaint against Virgin on April 11, 2012 before the French Competition Authority regarding an anticompetitive vertical agreement between Apple and its wholesale distributors (including Virgin). The case is pending. Complaint by SFR Fibre (ex NC Numericable) to the French Competition Authority On May 20, 2015, SFR Fibre filed a complaint against Groupe Canal Plus before the French Competition Authority based upon an abuse of dominant position of Groupe Canal Plus regarding its self-distribution. The complaint is pending. Complaint against Orange to the Competition Authority regarding the market in mobile telephony services for businesses On August 9, 2010, SFR filed a complaint against Orange with the Competition Authority for anticompetitive practices in the business mobile telephony services market. On March 5, 2015 the Competition Authority sent a notice of complaints to Orange. Four complaints were filed against Orange. On December 17, 2015, the Authority ordered Orange to pay a fine of €350 million. On June 18, 2015, SFR filed suit against Orange in the Commercial Court and is seeking €2.4 billion in damages subject to adjustment as remedy for the loss suffered as a result of the practices in question in the proceedings with the Competition Authority. On June 21, 2016, Orange filed an injunction to disclose several pieces of confidential data in SFR’s economic report for July 21, 2016. On June 28, 2017, the judge ruled on this procedural issue. Following this ruling, two Data Rooms were opened at Orange, the first one in September for the mobile services, and the second one in October for the fixed services. The substantive debate will only start after the analysis, from Orange, of the documents placed in Data Room. Potential failure to meet commitments made by Altice France as part of the takeover of exclusive control of SFR relating to the agreement signed by SFR and Bouygues Telecom on November 9, 2010 (Faber) Following a complaint from Bouygues Telecom, the Competition Authority officially opened an inquiry on October 5, 2015 to examine the conditions under which Altice France performs its commitments relating to the joint investment agreement entered into with Bouygues Telecom to roll out fiber optics in very densely populated areas. A session before the Competition Authority board was held on November 22, and then on December 7, 2016.On March 8, 2017, the Competition Authority imposed a financial sanction of €40 million against Altice and Altice France, for not having respected the commitments set out in the “Faber Agreement” at the time of the SFR acquisition by Numericable. This amount was recognized in the financial statements as of March 31, 2017 and was paid during the second quarter. The Competition Authority also imposed injunctions (new schedule including levels of achievement, with progressive penalty, in order to supply all the outstanding access points). A summary was lodged on April 13, 2017 before the Council of State. The judge in chambers of the Council of State said there is no matter to be referred. On September 28, 2017, the Council of State rejected the application for cancellation of the decision of the Competition Authority requested by Altice Europe and Altice France Group. The French Competition authority is currently controlling the compliance by SFR of the commitment set out in the Faber Agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Group considers that the risk is difficult to estimate reliably and is hence considered to be a contingent liability under IAS 37. SFR against Orange: abuse of dominant position in the second homes market On April 24, 2012, SFR filed a complaint against Orange with the Paris Commercial Court for practices abusing its dominant position in the retail market for mobile telephony services for non-residential customers. On February 12, 2014, the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay to SFR €51 million for abuse of dominant position in the second homes market. On April 2, 2014, Orange appealed the decision of the Commercial Court on the merits. On October 8, 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals overturned the Paris Commercial Court's ruling of February 12, 2014 and dismissed SFR’s requests. The Court of Appeals ruled that it had not been proven that a pertinent market limited to second homes actually exists. In the absence of such a market, there was no exclusion claim to answer, due to the small number of homes concerned. On October 13, 2014 SFR received notification of the judgment of the Paris Court of Appeals of October 8, 2014 and repaid the €51 million to Orange in November 2014. On November 19, 2014, SFR appealed the ruling. ----- On April 12, 2016, the French Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision and referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeal. Orange returned €52.7 million to SFR on May 31, 2016. Orange refilled the case before the Paris Court of Appeal on August 30, 2016. On June 8, 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal rejected Orange’s appeal. On December 24, 2018, Orange refiled an appeal with the Supreme Court. Orange against SFR and Bouygues Telecom (Sharing Agreement) On April 29, 2014, Orange applied to the French Competition Authority to disallow the agreement signed on January 31, 2014 by SFR and Bouygues Telecom to share their mobile access networks, based on Article L. 420-1 of the French Commercial Code and Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). In addition to this referral, Orange asked the Competition Authority for a certain number of injunctions against the companies involved. In a decision dated September 25, 2014, the Competition Authority dismissed all of Orange’s requested injunctions to stop SFR and Bouygues Telecom from implementing the agreement that they had signed to share part of their mobile networks. Orange appealed the Competition Authority's decision to dismiss its request for provisional measures. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision on January 29, 2015. Orange is now appealing the matter to the French Supreme Court. The Court of Cassation rendered a decision dismissing the appeal filed by Orange on October 4, 2016. The procedure is pending. SCT against SFR On October 11, 2017, SCT summoned SFR before Paris Commercial Court for some supposed dysfunctions and multiple failings in the delivery of our Fixe services, such as the loss of final clients as part of the supply of mobile services (MVNO). For this reason, SCT asks, on various grounds, for an amount around €48 million (divided into €25 million on the fixed services, €15 million for the loss of clients, €2 million for loss of revenues, €1 million for deployment delays, €3.5 million for dysfunctions which led a negative impact on their internal management, €0.5 million for overcharging, €0.8 million for purchases with Orange and €0.2 million for damages to their image). This case was subject to a conciliation proceeding between the parties. After the failure of this proceeding, the case was sent on the merits and SFR communicated its conclusions in response on March 13, 2018. SFR concluded its defense pleadings on February 26, 2019. SCT had until March 26, 2019 to respond. CLCV's summons and complaint against SFR On January 7, 2013, the consumer association CLCV filed a complaint against SFR in the Paris Commercial Court. CLCV claimed that some of the clauses in SFR’s general terms of subscription, and those of some other telephone operators, were unfair. It also asked for compensation for the collective loss suffered. The Paris District Court ruled that the clauses were unfair. On February 24, 2015, the Paris District court ruled that eight clauses included in the general terms of subscription were unfair and ordered SFR to publish the ruling on its website and three daily print publications. SFR was also asked to pay € 30,000 in damages to the CLCV. This decision was not executory and SFR appealed this ruling on April 16, 2015. The case was pleaded before the Appeals court of Paris on October 19, 2017. On March 30, 2018, the Appeals court of Paris ruled that seven (of the fifty or so clauses which the CLCV claimed were unfair/abusive) were unfair and demanded that SFR publish the entire ruling on its website preceded by the phrase ’legal communique’ and ordered SFR to remove said clauses from the general terms of subscription with a penalty of up to 300 euros per day of delay. The procedure is pending. Free against SFR: unfair practices for non-compliance with consumer credit provisions in a subsidized offer On May 21, 2012, Free filed a complaint against SFR in the Paris Commercial Court. Free challenged the subsidy used in SFR's “Carrés” offers sold over the web between June 2011 and December 2012, claiming that it constituted a form of consumer credit and, as such, SFR was guilty of unfair practices by not complying with the consumer credit provisions, in particular in terms of prior information to customers. Free asked the Paris Commercial Court to require SFR to inform its customers and to order it to pay €29 million in damages. On January 15, 2013, the Commercial Court dismissed all of Free’s requests and granted SFR €0.3 million in damages. On January 31, 2013, Free appealed the decision. ----- On March 9, 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the Paris Commercial Court’s ruling and denied all claims filed by Free. The amount of damages payable by Free to SFR was increased from €0.3 million to €0.5 million. On May 6, 2016, Free filed an appeal. SFR’s pleadings in defense were filed on November 8, 2016. The court of cassation rendered a decision on March 7, 2018 .This decision overturned and partially cancelled the decision rendered by the Court of Appeal and referred the case back to the Court of Appeal. The Court of Cassation considered that the Paris Court of Appeal had based its prior judgment on improper motives to exclude the mobile subsidy provided by SFR on its subscriptions from the scope of consumer credit. In addition, the Court of Cassation reaffirmed the sentencing for Free mobile to pay €0.5 million for the defamation suffered by Altice France. The Group is awaiting the reintroduction of Free mobile’s request before the Court of Appeals. SFR against Iliad, Free and Free mobile: unfair competition by disparagement On May 27, 2014, SFR filed a complaint against Iliad, Free and Free Mobile in the Paris Commercial Court for unfair competition claiming that when Free Mobile was launched and afterwards, Iliad, Free and Free Mobile were guilty of disparaging SFR services. SFR claimed €493 million in damages. On September 9, 2016 by pleadings on counterclaims, Free requested the court to judge that SFR denigrated their capacities and services and claimed €475 million in damages. The Paris Commercial Court rendered its judgment on January 29, 2018. The Court sentenced Free Mobile to pay to SFR €20 million as moral damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. In addition, the court sentenced SFR to pay to Free Mobile €25 million as moral and material damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. Accordingly, the court sentences, as compensation, SFR to pay to Free Mobile €5 million as damages. This decision was executed and the Group paid the €5 million net amount to Free Mobile in June 2018. SFR appealed this decision. The case is still pending. Disputes regarding the transfer of customer call centers from Toulouse, Lyon and Poitiers Following the transfer of customer call centers from Toulouse and Lyon to the company Infomobile and the Poitiers call centers to a subsidiary of the Bertelsmann Group, the former employees at those sites filed legal actions at Labor Tribunals in each city to penalize what they claim were unfair employment contracts constituting fraud under Article L. 1224-1 of the French Labor Code and also contravening the legal provisions regarding dismissal for economic reasons. The rulings in 2013 were mixed as the Toulouse Court of Appeals penalized SFR and Téléperformance in half of the cases while the Lyon and Poitiers courts ruled in favor of SFR. The cases are now at different stages of proceedings: Labor Tribunal, Court of Appeals and Court of Cassation. Litigation over distribution in the independent network (Consumer market and SFR Business Team) SFR, like companies operating an indirect distribution model, faces complaints from a certain number of its distributors and almost routinely from former distributors. Such recurring complaints revolve around claims of sudden breach of contractual relations, abuse of economic dependency and/or demands for requalification as a sales agent as well as, more recently, demands for requalification as a contractual branch manager and requalification as SFR contracted point of sale staff. Free against SFR In July 2015, Free filed suit against SFR in order to stop it from using the word “Fiber,” claiming that the solution marketed by SFR is not a fiber to the home (FTTH) solution. Free considers SFR’s communication to be deceptive about substantial qualities and, on that basis, is asking the court to find there is parasitism and unfair competition. On January 19, 2018, the court rendered a decision. The decision condemned SFR to: - €1 million as moral damages; - Communicate, within 90 days following the date of the judgment notification, to each client having subscribed to SFR or Numericable, of an offer including the term « fibre » (excluding FTTH offers) on IT support and paper support information relating to : i) the precise nature of its connection to optical fibre ii) the number of subscribers sharing coaxial connection and iii) the average connection speed at peak hours and off-peak hours; - Inform, within 90 days following the date of the judgment notification, each client having subscribed to SFR or NC to an offer including the term « fibre » (excluding FFTH offers) that they benefit from a possibility of immediate termination to default of previous information about the exact characteristics of the offer; ----- - €0.1 million as article 700. The court considered having made a material error in failing to mention provisional enforcement in the judgment. Accordingly, the court decided, by the judgment dated February 12, 2018, the provisional enforcement for all convictions in this case. Pending notification of judgments by Free, SFR is preparing the summons in summary proceedings for the First President of the Court of Appeal in order to cease provisional enforcement in this case. Familles Rurales against SFR In May 2015, Familles Rurales filed suit against SFR in the Paris District Court in the context of a class action seeking remedy for the loss allegedly suffered by consumers, claiming deceptive sales practices used by SFR in its communications about 4G.Familles Rurales requested a provision of €0.1 million. On October 3, 2018, the Tribunal de Grande Instance of Paris rendered a judgment rejecting the requests of Familles Rurales and sentenced the Familles Rurales association to pay €0.02 million based on Article 700 of the Code de Procédure Civile. The closing ordinance will occur on April 11, 2019, and the case will be pleaded concomitantly in collegiate before the Court of Appeal of Paris. Tracetel and Intermobility against SFR: Velib In May 2017, Tracetel and Intermobility sued SFR before the “Tribunal de Commerce de Paris” in order to obtain compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the two contracting parties in the context of the response to the tender procedure of the Vélib DSP. They accuse SFR of not having filed the joint offer and are asking for the sentencing of SFR to the tune of €76.7 million for loss of tender. To date, the Group is challenging the merits of these claims. In November 2018, at the time of the submission of summary conclusions, Tracetel and Intermobility requested that, in the event of rejection of their principal claim, the Group will be ordered to pay a minimum of €2.5 million. The conclusions of SFR in response were filed on January 25, 2019. The hearing date is not yet fixed. In-depth inquiry of the European Commission into the assignment of cable infrastructures by certain local authorities On July 17, 2013, the European Commission signaled that it had decided to open an investigation to verify whether the transfer of public cable infrastructure between 2003 and 2006 by several French municipalities to SFR Fibre (ex NC Numericable) was consistent with European Union government aid rules. In announcing the opening of this in-depth investigation, the European Commission indicated that it believes that the sale of public assets to a private company without proper compensation gives the latter an economic advantage not enjoyed by its competitors, and that it therefore constitutes government aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union and that the free-of-charge transfer of the cable networks and ducts by 33 French municipalities to SFR Fibre, they have argued, confers a benefit of this type and, as such, is government aid. The European Commission has expressed doubts about the compatibility of the alleged aid with the rules of the European Union. The Group firmly denies the existence of any government aid. In addition, the decision to open an investigation concerns a relatively small number of network connections (approximately 200,000), the majority of which have not been migrated to EuroDocsis 3.0 and only allow access to a limited number of the Group’s television services. The European Commission’s decision of July 17, 2013 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on September 17, 2013. Since then, discussions have continued within the framework of this process both in terms of comments from third parties as well as those from the parties to the proceedings as to the allegation of the existence of aid and its extent, with the Group firmly challenging the existence of any government aid. Dispute with Orange concerning certain IRUs The Group signed four non-exclusive IRUs with Orange on May 6, 1999, May 18, 2001, July 2, 2004 and December 21, 2004, in connection with the Group’s acquisition of certain companies operating cable networks built by Orange. These cable networks, accessible only through the civil engineering installations of Orange (mainly its ducts), are made available to the Group by Orange through these non-exclusive IRUs. Each of these IRUs covers a different geographic area and was signed for a term of 20 years. Following ARCEP’s Decision 2008-0835 of July 24, 2008, Orange published, on September 15, 2008, a technical and commercial offer made to telecommunication operators allowing them access to the civil engineering infrastructures of the local wire-based network, pursuant to which the operators can roll out their own fiber networks in Orange’s ducts. The terms of this mandatory technical and commercial offer are more restrictive than the terms that the Group enjoys under the Orange IRUs. ----- As a result, in December 2011, SFR Fibre (ex NC Numericable) and Orange signed amendments to the IRUs in order to comply with the November 4, 2010 ARCEP decision and to align the operating procedures set out in the IRUs with the procedures set out in the Orange general technical and commercial offer. Lastly, SFR Fibre initiated parallel proceedings against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris on October 7, 2010 claiming damages of €2.7 billion for breach and modification of the IRUs by Orange. On April 23, 2012, the Commercial Court of Paris ruled in favor of Orange and dismissed the Group’s claims for damages, ruling that there were no material differences between the original operational procedures and the new operational procedures imposed on SFR Fibre by Orange under the terms of its general technical and commercial offer, published on September 15, 2008. SFR Fibre appealed this decision before the Paris Court of Appeals and claimed the same amount of damages as it had before the Paris Commercial Court. Orange, in turn, claims that this proceeding materially impaired its brand and image, and is seeking an order to make SFR Fibre pay damages of €50 million. In a ruling dated June 20, 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals dismissed SFR Fibre’s appeal, which was referred to the Court of Cassation on August 14, 2014. On February 2, 2015, the Court of Cassation set aside the ruling of the Paris Court of Appeals except in that it recognized SFR Fibre’s interest in acting and referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeals. Action by Colt, Free and Orange in the General Court of the European Union concerning the DSP 92 project Colt, Free and Orange, in three separate motions filed against the European Commission before the General Court of the European Union seeking to annul the European Commission’s final decision of September 30, 2009 (Decision C (2009) 7426), which held that the compensation of €59 million granted for the establishment and operation of a high-speed electronic communications network in the department of Hauts-de-Seine does not constitute government aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union. The Group is not party to this proceeding. Its subsidiary Sequalum is acting as the civil party, as well as the French government and the department of Hauts-de-Seine. In three rulings dated September 16, 2013, the General Court of the European Union rejected the requests of the three applicants and confirmed the aforementioned decision of the European Commission. Free and Orange have appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Litigation between Sequalum and CG 92 regarding DSP 92 A disagreement arose between the Hauts-de-Seine General Council (“CG92”) and Sequalum regarding the terms of performance of a utilities public service concession contract (“THD Seine”) signed on March 13, 2006 between Sequalum, a subsidiary of the Group, and the Hauts-de-Seine General Council; the purpose of this delegation was to create a very-high-speed fiber optic network in the Hauts-de-Seine region. The Hauts-de-Seine General Council meeting of October 17, 2014 decided to terminate the public service delegation agreement signed with Sequalum “for misconduct by the delegatee for whom it is solely responsible”. Pursuant to two decisions rendered on March 16, 2017, Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise rejected the actions brought by Sequalum against two enforcement measures issued by the department of Hauts-de-Seine in respect of penalties, for amounts of €51.6 million and €45.1 million. Sequalum appealed the two decisions before the Administrative Court of Versailles, but paid the amount of €97 million over the month of July. Refer to Note 4 – Significant events for the fiscal year. Sequalum claims that the termination was unlawful and continued to perform the contract, subject to any demands that the delegator may impose. Should the competent courts confirm this interpretation of unlawful termination, Sequalum may primarily have (i) to repay the public subsidies received for the DSP 92 project, normally the outstanding component of the subsidies (the company received €25 million in subsidies from the General Council), (ii) to reimburse any deferred income (estimated at €32 million by the Department) and (iii) to compensate the Department for any losses suffered (amount estimated by the Department of €212 million). In turn, the department of Hauts-de-Seine received the returnable assets of the DSP on July 1, 2015. Furthermore, the General Council will have to pay compensation to Sequalum, which essentially corresponds to the net value of the assets. On October 16, 2014, Sequalum filed a motion in the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise requesting the termination of the public service concession because of force majeure residing in the irreversible disruption of the structure of the contract, with the resulting payment of compensation in Sequalum’s favor. At December 31, 2015, the assets were removed from Sequalum’s accounts in the amount of €116 million. Income receivable in the amount of €139 million related to the expected indemnification was also recognized, an amount fully depreciated given the situation. On July 11, 2016, the department of Hauts-de-Seine established a breakdown of all amounts due (in its opinion) by each Party for the various disputes, and issued demands based on said breakdown. Each amount was subject to a decision by the public accountant dated July 13, 2016 (final amount established by the latter for a net amount of €181.6 million, taking into account the carrying amount due in his opinion to Sequalum). This breakdown, the ----- various demands and the compensation decision were subject to applications for annulment filed by Sequalum with the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise on September 10, 12 and 14, 2016. These applications remain pending, except for the application for annulment relating to the breakdown (the court having considered that the breakdown was not a measure which could be appealed. Sequalum appealed this decision before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeals). Altice France outlined that it had its own optical fiber in the Haut-de-Seine department enabling it to serve its customers. In September 2017, the department issued three revenue orders (titres de recette) in order to minimize the balance due to Sequalum at the time of counting. These demands were contested: - Order of an amount of €23.2 million for the unamortized portion of the subsidies : SFR’s appeal dismissed, - Order of an amount of €31.9 million for deferred income : successful appeal for SFR, - Order of an amount of €5.7 million for amounts received as prepayment for connections: SFR’s appeal dismissed. The Department issued a revenue order of €212 million for damages suffered as a result of the faults based on which the contract was terminated. The judgment was rendered on February 15, 2018. It reduces the indemnity by €187 million and reduces, correlatively, the amount of the revenue order to €26 million. The department appealed this judgment; the judgment rendered on July 5, 2018 granted Sequalum's request for cancellation of the compensation. On the other hand, the request for repayment was rejected. This rejection was appealed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In application of IFRS 15, the Group has identified those items as separate performance obligations. Total revenue will be allocated to both elements based on their stand-alone selling price, leading to more revenue being allocated to the handset upfront. This will also impact the timing of revenue recognition as the handset is delivered up-front, even though total revenue will not change in most cases over the life of the contract. Other IFRS 15 topics impacting the accounts include capitalization of commissions (including prepaid and renewal commissions which will be broader than the current capitalization model, along with depreciation pattern which will require estimates relating to the contract duration in some instances (prepaid business for example).",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

Additional services will be examined separately. ----- Other identified topics relate to connection fees, related costs and capitalization of commissions. Related estimates include the determination of capitalized assets depreciation period based (i) on contract period and (ii) possible additional periods related to anticipated contract that the Group can specifically identify. The quantitative impact of IFRS 15 at the opening balance is detailed below: - Shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2017 increased by €250.8 million after deferred tax effect mainly due to the mobile handsets subsidies contract assets and the effect of the change in commission capitalization and amortization pattern. - Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA decreased by €95.4 million and €77.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The impact is mainly linked to: `o` The handsets subsidies adjustments as described above linked to a decrease in the sale of mobile bundles offers over the last years. `o` Change in the scope of commissions capitalized under IFRS 15. - Thus net result for the year ended 2017 decreased by €68.9 million.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.875,38.1.** **IFRS 15 - Revenue from contracts with customers,1.875.3,,"The Group has adopted IFRS 15 – _Revenue from contracts with customers for annual period beginning on January 1, 2018, in accordance with the full retrospective method by restating each prior period and recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the beginning of the earliest period presented (January 1, 2017). The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under IFRS 15, an entity recognizes revenue when the ‘control’ of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. Far more prescriptive guidance has been added in IFRS 15 to deal with specific situations. Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 15. In addition, in April 2016, the IASB issued Clarifications to IFRS 15 in response to feedback received by the IASB and FASB Joint Transition Resource group for Revenue recognition. The clarifications provide additional guidance on identifying performance obligations, principal versus agent consideration and licensing application guidance. The details of the significant changes and quantitative impact of the changes are set out below.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.876,38.2.** **IFRS 9 – Financial instruments,1.876.1,,"IFRS 9 - _Financial instruments issued on July 24, 2014 is the IASB’s replacement of IAS 39 –_ _Financial _instruments: recognition and measurement._ The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. The Group implemented the standard based on the simplified retrospective approach; the transition impact was recorded in equity as of January 1, 2018 with an impact of €24.5 million after deferred tax and can be broken as follows: - Financial liabilities restructuring, net of deferred taxes : €44.7million, - Bad debt provision, net of deferred taxes: €(20.2) million. Main impacts of IFRS 9 are explained below: - Based on the IFRS 9 guidance, financial liabilities that have been renegotiated in previous period, where the renegotiated terms were considered as a non-substantial modification of the initial terms (cash flows modified in a proportion equal to or lower than 10%), requires a specific treatment upon transition to IFRS 9. Under IFRS 9, the Company should use the original effective interest rate to calculate the carrying value of the debt which is the present value of the modified future cash flows. Under IAS 39, for financial liabilities that have been renegotiated, the effective interest rate is changed on a prospective basis, with no income statement impact at the renegotiation date. For restructuring of financial liabilities that have been treated as extinguishment of debt, there is no impact under IFRS 9. - Based on the IFRS 9 guidance, the Group has applied the simplified model for trade receivables and contracts assets (without significant financing component) and has applied the expected credit loss model (i.e. including forward looking information) on assets (i.e. trade receivables not yet due and contract assets IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers). Under currents standard, the bad debt was calculated based on incurred losses. - The new standard also implies change of classification in financial assets. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

These assessments, different from Key Audit Matters defined by the European Regulation, were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Group’s management report.

16,Final Offerings 2020.md,1,TABLE OF CONTENTS,1.901,Altice France Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements,1.901.1,,"Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: - Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; - Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; - Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; - Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements.

Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements,1.929.2,,"Altice France (formerly SFR Group) (hereinafter “the Company” or “the Group”) is a limited liability corporation (société anonyme) formed under French law in August 2013 with headquarters in France. Created subsequent to the merger of Numericable and SFR, the Group Altice France aims to become, on the back of the largest fiber optic network and a leading mobile network, the national leader in France in very-high-speed fixed-line/mobile convergence. The Group has major positions in all segments of the French B2C, B2B, local authorities and wholesale telecommunications market. Altice France is also adopting a new and increasingly integrated model around access and content convergence. Its division Media includes SFR Presse companies, which cover the Group’s Press activities in France (Groupe l’Express, Libération, etc) and NextRadioTV, which covers the Group’s audiovisual activities in France (SFR Sport, BFM TV, BFM Business, BFM Paris, RMC, RMC Découverte, ...). On August 9, 2017, Altice announced the finalization of several agreements to acquire Altice France shares by way of exchange for ordinary A shares of Altice N.V. Altice thereby passed the 95% threshold of Altice France’s capital and voting rights. On September 4, 2017, Altice filed a buyout offer, followed by a squeeze-out for the remaining Altice France shares for a price of €34.50 per share. On September 19, 2017, the AMF approved the proposed offer in its original form, without any modifications. The buyout offer was opened from September 21, to October 4, 2017 included; the squeeze out was effective on October 9, 2017, date from which Altice France is no longer listed on Euronext Paris. As of December 31, 2017, Altice N.V. directly or indirectly held 100% of the capital of Altice France S.A. This Note describes the changes in the accounting principles adopted by the Group for the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017.

The Standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement, impairment, de-recognition and general hedge accounting regarding financial instruments.

Basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements (Continued),1.930.3,IFRS 16 Leases,"IFRS 16 Leases issued on January 13, 2016 is the IASB’s replacement of IAS 17 Leases. IFRS 16 specifies how to recognize, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. IFRS 16 applies to annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Group has the option to either: - apply IFRS 16 with full retrospective effect; or - recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to opening equity at the date of initial application (simplified retrospective approach). The Group has decided to apply the simplified retrospective approach and the transition impact will be recorded in equity as of January 1, 2019 with no impact on 2018. The Board of Directors anticipate that the application of IFRS 16 in the future may have a material impact on amounts reported in respect of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities, especially given the different operating lease arrangements of the Group. The effects are analyzed as part of a Group-wide project for implementing this new standard. The assessment phase is under progress and it is not yet practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the quantitative effects until the projects have been completed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In addition, in April 2016, the IASB issued Clarifications to IFRS 15 in response to feedback received by the IASB and FASB Joint Transition Resource group for Revenue recognition. The clarifications provide additional guidance on identifying performance obligations, principal versus agent consideration and licensing application guidance. The standard (as amended in April 2016) is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The Group is required to retrospectively apply IFRS 15 to all contracts that are not complete on the date of initial application and have the option to either: - restate each prior period and recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity at the beginning of the earliest period presented (full retrospective approach); or - retain prior period figures as reported under the previous standards and recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 15 as an adjustment to the opening balance of equity as at the date of initial application. This approach will also require additional disclosures in the year of initial application to explain how the relevant financial statement line items would be affected by the application of IFRS 15 as compared to previous standards. The Group has decided to adopt the standard based on the full retrospective approach. The Group has implemented a comprehensive project across geographic areas to determine the potential differences with current revenue recognition. The issue identification phase is complete and the implementation plan has been finalized. _Mobile activities:_ The most significant impact is expected in the mobile activities (B2C and B2B transactions) as some arrangements include multiple elements that are being bundled: a handset component sold at a discounted price and a communication service component. In application of IFRS 15, the group has identified those items as separate performance obligations. Total revenue will be allocated to both elements based on their stand-alone selling price, leading to more revenue being allocated to the handset upfront. This will also impact the timing of revenue recognition as the handset is delivered up-front, even though total revenue will not change in most cases over the life of the contract. Other IFRS 15 topics impacting the accounts include capitalization of commissions (including prepaid and renewal commissions which will be broader than the current capitalization model, along with depreciation pattern which will require estimates relating to the contract duration in some instances (prepaid business for example). _Fixed activities_ In most cases, the service and the equipment will not be considered as distinct performance obligations. Additional services will be examined separately. Other identified topics relate to connection fees, related costs and capitalization of commissions. Related estimates include the determination of capitalized assets depreciation period based (i) on contract period and (ii) possible additional periods related to anticipated contract that the Group can specifically identify. The best estimate of the quantitative impact is detailed below: - Shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2016 would increase by approximately €251.0 million after deferred tax effect mainly due to the mobile handsets subsidies contract assets and the effect of the change in commission capitalization and amortization pattern, - Revenue and adjusted EBITDA would decrease by approximately €95 million and €78.0 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017. The impact is mainly linked to: - The handsets subsidies adjustments as described above. The decrease in the revenue and adjusted EBITDA is mainly explained by a decrease in the sale of mobile bundles offers over the last years. ----- - Change in the scope of commissions that will be capitalized under IFRS 15 as described above. - Thus net result for the year ended 2017 would decrease by approximately €69.0 million",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The concept of return is defined broadly, and includes dividends and other forms of distributed financial benefits, the valuation of the investment, cost savings, synergies, etc.; - The parent company has the ability to use its power to affect the subsidiary’s returns. Any power that does not entail this kind of influence does not qualify as control. These entities are consolidated using the full consolidation method. Where the elements of such transactions cannot be identified or analyzed as separable from a larger offer, they are considered to be related and the associated revenue is recognized in its entirety over the term of the contract or the expected duration of the customer relationship. Deferred tax is recognized in respect of temporary differences on the closing date between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognized for the following temporary differences: (i) the initial recognition of goodwill, (ii) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and (iii) investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates when the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and when it is probable that these temporary differences will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, in accordance with the rules in effect at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and if they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities when the taxable entity intends to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or when tax assets and liabilities are to be realized simultaneously. Deferred taxes are reviewed at each reporting date to take into account changes in tax legislation and the possibility of recovering deductible temporary differences and tax losses. A deferred tax asset is recognized when it is probable that future taxable profits against which the temporary difference can be utilized will be available. When goodwill is determined provisionally at the end of the period in which the combination is effected, any adjustments to the provisional values within 12 months of the acquisition date are recognized in goodwill. Changes in the Group’s share of ownership of equity securities in a subsidiary which do not lead to a loss of control over the latter are recognized as shareholders’ equity transactions. Goodwill resulting from the acquisition of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing whenever there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, and at least once a year in accordance with the methods and assumptions described in Note 13—Goodwill and Impairment Tests. After initial recognition, goodwill is recorded at cost less accumulated impairment losses. _Specific case of business combination under common control_ Business combination under common control are combinations in which all of the combination (entities or businesses) are controlled by on party (or several), i) during a long period before and after the combination, ii) this control as defined in IFRS10—Consolidated financial statements is not temporary. These combinations are excluded from IFRS3 R scope. These operations in the consolidated financial statements are prepared on historical cost basis. No new goodwill is generated and the difference between the acquisition price and the historical carrying value related to assets and liabilities of the acquired entity is recognized in equity. IRUs correspond to the right to use a portion of the capacity of a terrestrial or submarine transmission cable granted for a fixed period. IRUs are recognized as an asset when the Group has the specific indefeasible right to use an identified portion of the underlying asset, generally optical fiber or dedicated wavelength bandwidth, and the duration of the right is for the majority of the underlying asset’s useful life. They are amortized over the shorter of the expected period of use and the life of the contract between 3 and 30 years. Patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of use (generally not exceeding 10 years). Software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life (which generally does not exceed 3 years). The “intangible model” provided by this interpretation applies when the operator receives a right to charge users of the public service and is substantially paid by the user. Intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the relevant asset categories and the duration of the concession. of the operating segments (see Note 13.3—Main Assumptions Used). The principal allocation keys used to allocate shared assets and liabilities are based on revenues, use of the network or the information systems. The value in use of each asset or group of assets is determined as the present value of future cash flows (discounted cash flow method or “DCF”) by using a discount rate after tax specific to each asset or group of assets concerned. The fair value less costs to sell is the amount obtainable on the measurement date from the sale of the asset or group of assets in an ordinary transaction between market participants, less costs to sell. When the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its net recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the “Depreciation, amortization and impairment” caption of the consolidated statement of income. Only impairment losses recognized on assets other than goodwill such as depreciable intangible assets, intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and property, plant and equipment may be reversed. - In the consolidated statement of cash flows in a separate caption in the net cash flow provided (used) by operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. - The net investment hedge is a hedge against exposure to changes in value attributable to the foreign currency risk of a net investment in a foreign operation that could affect profit when the investment is sold. The effective portion of net investment hedges is recognized through other comprehensive income and reclassified in profit or loss when the net investment is sold. The cessation of hedge accounting may result in particular from the elimination of the hedged item, voluntary termination of the hedging relationship, or the cancelation or maturity of the hedging instrument. The accounting consequences are as follows: - For fair value hedges: the fair value adjustment of debt at the date of cessation of the hedging relationship is amortized based on a recalculated effective interest rate on that date; - For cash flow hedges: the amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are reclassified into profit or loss when the hedged item is eliminated. In other cases, they are taken straight to profit or loss over the remaining term of the hedging relationship as originally defined. In both cases, the subsequent changes in value of the hedging instrument are recognized in profit or loss. The Group recognizes the corresponding net expense over the entire estimated period of service of the employees. The actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are recognized in their entirety as “Other items of comprehensive income” in the period in which they occur. The cost of the plans is recognized through operating income, with the exception of the accretion cost, which is recognized as other financial expenses and income.

Significant events for the fiscal year (Continued),1.978.1,,"Insofar as Numericable was already highly present with the very high speed offers of its FTTB cable network in this high density area, the Authority considered that the takeover of SFR by Numericable may have cast doubts over SFR’s incentive to honor its commitments to its joint investors, and in particular to Bouygues. To address this potential risk, the Authority therefore requested commitments were made to guarantee that the new group would supply the buildings requested by Bouygues Telecom under the Agreement. These commitments covered three main points: – The obligation to provide distribution services for all Termination Points delivered as of October 30, 2014 within two years; – The drawing up of a rider to the Faber Agreement allowing Bouygues Telecom to order a list of buildings of its choice for the distribution to Termination Points delivered after October 30, 2014 within three months (excluding performance constraints); – The provision of maintenance for the FTTH infrastructure in a transparent and non-discriminatory manner using specially introduced quality indicators. By Decision No.15-SO-14 dated October 5, 2015, the Competition Authority opened ex officio an inquiry into the conditions under which Altice and Altice France respect these commitments. By Decision No. 17-D-04 dated March 8, 2017, the Competition Authority decided to levy a financial sanction of €40 million against Altice and Altice France, and imposed periodic penalty payments for each day of delay, for not having respected the commitments set out in the “Faber Agreement”. This amount was recognized in the financial statements as of March 31, 2017 and was paid over the second quarter. A summary was lodged on April 13, 2017 before the French Supreme Court (Conseil d’état). The judge in chambers of the Council of State said there is no matter to be referred. On September 28, 2017, the supreme Court rejected the request of cancelling ADLC decision put forth by Altice and SFR. 3—a period between July 2017 and June 2019 during which employees could also benefit from a voluntary departure plan under conditions to be defined. In any case, the Group has made a commitment that the SFR Telecom division would have no fewer than 10,000 employees during this period. The first phase of this agreement, namely the reorganization of retail stores, ended at end-March 2017 with the validation of about 800 departures of employees. At end December 2017, a residual amount of €8 million was recognized for restructuring of retail stores in provisions. The amount paid as of December, 31, 2017 was €87 million and the amount recorded in payables was €21 million at the end of December 31, 2017. Furthermore, the GPEC Group Agreement was signed on February 1, 2017 by the majority of the representative unions of the Altice France Telecom division. It specifies the external mobility scheme offered to the employees for the period before June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, 1,360 employees took benefit of the “Mobilité Volontaire Sécurisée” plan (MVS: suspension of labour contract) of the GPEC, and benefited in priority from the voluntary departure plan. Finally, the “Livre 2”, a legally binding document that described the target organization of the Telecom division of SFR was delivered to the representative unions on April 3, 2017. The validation commissions began on July. A restructuring provision was recognized for this voluntary departure plan amounted €742 million as of June 30, 2017, partially offset by the reversal of employee benefit plan provisions amounting to €49 million. The plan ended in end-November 2017 (except for SRR) with the validation of about 3,200 departures of employees. Following this validation, a reversal of provision, amounting to €700 million (of which €675 million utilized) was recognized as of December 31, 2017 and replaced by payables for an amount of €675 million. Of the remaining €675 million, €262 million was paid out in 2017 with the remainder in payables is for an amount of €413 million as of December 2017. Additionally, following the disposal of SFR Service Client in December 2017 (see Note 5—Change in scope), the remaining provision of €9 million attributable to SFR Service Client was derecognized. The residual amount of €32 million was recognized in provisions as of December 31, 2017. These refinancings also allowed the Group to reduce the cost of those Term Loans: – The Term Loan B7 in US dollars was bearing interest at three-month LIBOR (with a 0.75% floor) plus a margin of 4.25%. The new tranche B11 in US dollars is bearing interest at three-month LIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus a margin of 2.75%. This represents a decrease of 1.50%. Moreover, at the time of the refinancing, the three-month LIBOR was higher than the former floor of 0.75%. – The Term Loan B9 in euros was bearing interest at three-month EURIBOR (with a 0.75% floor) plus a margin of 3.25%. The new tranche B11 (SG) in euros is bearing interest at three-month EURIBOR (with a 0.00% floor) plus a margin of 3.00%. This represents a decrease of 0.25% of the margin and also a decrease of 0.75% of the floor, as the three-month EURIBOR was negative at the time of the refinancing. – The Term Loan B7 in euros was bearing interest at three-month EURIBOR (with a 0.75% floor) plus a margin of 3.75%. The new tranche B11 (YF) in euros is bearing interest at three-month EURIBOR (with a 0% floor) plus a margin of 3.00%. This represents a decrease of 0.75% of the margin and also a decrease of 0.75% of the floor, as the three-month EURIBOR was negative at the time of the refinancing. From an accounting standpoint, these operations were treated as a non-substantial modification of the existing debt and hence the issuance costs capitalized in previous periods were rolled over onto the new debt as per IAS 39. Following these improvements in the conditions of the Group debts, the average debt maturity was extended from 7.0 to 7.3 years and the weighted average cost of debt decreased from 5.2% to 4.9%. As there was no significant change in the outstanding amounts under the debts denominated in US Dollar before and after the refinancing, there has been no changes in the hedging instruments. On October 9, 2017, Altice N.V. announced that it has successfully re-priced for Altice France the 2025 Term Loan amounted to €2.9 billion. Proceeds were used to refinance its €697 million and $1.8 billion January 2025 Term Loan and to repay €600 million of commercial paper. These refinancings allowed the Group to extend the maturities of the Term Loans: – The Term Loan B10 in US dollars was maturing in January 2025. The new tranche B12 in US dollars is maturing in January 2026: an extension of 12 months. – The Term Loan B10 in euros was maturing in January 2025. The new tranche B12 in euros is maturing in January 2026: an extension of 12 months.

The new tranche B12 in US dollars is bearing interest at LIBOR (with a 0.00% floor) plus a margin of 3.00%. This represents a decrease of 0.25%. Moreover, at the time of the renegotiation, the three-month LIBOR was higher than the former floor of 0.75%. – The Term Loan B10 in euros was bearing interest at EURIBOR (with a 0.75% floor) plus a margin of 3.00%. The new tranche B12 in euros is bearing interest at EURIBOR (with a 0.00% floor) plus a margin of 3.00%. This represents a decrease of 0.75% with the decrease of the floor as the threemonth EURIBOR was negative at the time of the refinancing. The average maturity of SFR’s capital structure was extended from 6.8 to 7.2 years and the weighted average cost of debt decreased to at 4.7%. This refinancing was treated as an extinguishment of financial instruments and issuance costs capitalized in prior periods were expensed via the consolidated statement of income (see Note 11— _Financial income)._ from Newsco’s B2B activities and L’Etudiant to the holding company Coalition Media Group, controlled by Marc Laufer. The Group subsequently acquired a 25% stake in this holding. As part of the transaction, the vendor loan contracted during the acquisition of AMGF for 100 million euros was fully reimbursed. The group recorded a €28 million capital gain.

Main assumptions used,"The goodwill impairment test was conducted on the basis of the operating segments defined above. In accordance with IAS 36 on impairment of goodwill, the impairment test is performed by comparing the carrying amount with the recoverable amount for each of the operating segments. The conditions for allocation of assets and liabilities shared by the operating segments are described in Note 2.13—Impairment of assets. The recoverable amount is determined based on the value in use using a discounted cash flow model. The value in use is determined by using cash projects based on financial budgets approved by Management covering a five-year period. Projections of subscribers, revenue, costs and capital expenditure are based on reasonable and acceptable assumptions that represent Management’s best estimates. These assumptions are based on the projected number of subscribers, the level of expenses to improve network infrastructures, and the savings related to the continued implementation of the synergies identified by the Group. The projections are based on both past experience and the expected future market penetration of the various products. All these elements have been assigned, either directly or indirectly, to the operating segments of the Group. As indicated in Note 2.13—Impairment of assets, the determination of the value in use also depends on assumptions such as the discount rate and the perpetuity growth rate. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

This contract, worth a total of one billion euros over a 15-year term, is to finance, build, operate and maintain a digital telecommunications network to provide voice and data communication between trains and ground control teams in conference mode. The network will be rolled out gradually on 14,000 km of traditional and high-speed rail lines in France. Synerail Construction, a subsidiary of Vinci (60%) and SFR (40%), is responsible of the construction of this network. The value of these equity-accounted securities is positive as shown in the table above. c) SFR and Vinci Immobilier, a subsidiary of Vinci Group, have four subsidiaries in common which they own 50:50—Foncière Rimbaud 1, Foncière Rimbaud 2, Foncière Rimbaud 3 and Foncière Rimbaud 4—as part of the construction of SFR’s headquarters in Saint-Denis.

Commitments relating to bonds and term loans,"In May 2014, the Group issued bonds and set up term loans to refinance its historic debt and fund a portion of the SFR acquisition. In July 2015, in the form of an additional facility under the same legal documentation as the loans taken out in May 2014, the Group set up new term loan for the purpose of refinancing its revolving credit lines. Then, in order to fund a portion of the December 2015 distribution, the Group took out a term loan in October 2015. The latter was also structured as an additional tranche under the existing documentation. In April 2016, the Group set up new bonds and term loans for the purpose to refinance a portion of the loans raised in 2014. In October 2016, the Group set up new term loan tranches. The loans setting up in 2016 were structured as additional debt under the existing documentation. In April and October 2017, the Group refinanced some of its term loans and were structured as additional debt under the existing documentation. As part of these various loans, established under the same financial documentation, a certain number of Group subsidiaries (Altice France, SFR, Ypso France, Altice B2B France, NC Numericable, Numericable US LLC, Numericable US SAS, Completel and Ypso Finance) pledged certain assets to banks (equity instruments of Group companies, bank accounts intercompany loans, trademarks and goodwill). Additionally, in the event of a change in control (should a company other than Altice N.V. or an affiliate of Altice N.V. come to hold more than 51% of Altice France), the Group would have to offer to repay its debt for an amount equal to 101% of the amount outstanding on that debt. Term loans and Bonds issued also include certain restrictions that limit the Group’s ability to: - Incur or guarantee any additional debt, subject to a consolidated net debt leverage ratio (4.5x for total debt and 3.25x for bonds); - Draw the RCF line subject to a consolidated net debt leverage ratio (4.5x for 2017 and beyond); -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

In compliance with this decision, Altice France is implementing the respective commitments.

Coverage commitments relating to SFR telecommunication licenses,"On November 30, 2009, the Regulatory Authority on Electronic Communications and Postal Services (ARCEP) demanded that SFR comply with the 99.3% coverage rate of the UMTS network in the metropolitan population as of December 31, 2013. By Decision No. 2014-0624 dated May 27, 2014, ARCEP opened an administrative inquiry concerning SFR in order to ensure that the UMTS coverage complied with its commitments. In a decision on February 9, 2017, ARCEP definitively closed this administrative inquiry. It ruled that the coverage map transmitted by SFR was sufficiently reliable and demonstrated compliance with the obligation for its 3G network to cover 99.3% of the metropolitan population. As of December 31, 2017, the coverage rate of 3G network was 99.8%. By decision No. 2016-1690-RDPI dated December 13, 2016, ARCEP notified SFR to comply with provisions of Article 119-1 of the Act No. 2008-776 dated August 4, 2008 regarding the modernization of the economy. SFR must have to ensure the mobile coverage of 3G or 4G by June 30, 2017: - City centers of municipalities related to the « Phase 1 » listed on appendix A of the decision for which SFR is a leader operator and the passive infrastructures have been made available by the public authorities; corresponding to 389 municipalities. - City centers of municipaliiesy related to the « Phase II », listed on appendix B, for wich SFR is a leader operator, corresponding to 124 municipalities. After performing tests on the field, ARCEP noted at end-July 2017 that SFR complied with the requirements of this notification. As part of the allocation of the first block of LTE frequencies in October 2011 (2.6 GHz), SFR undertook to provide coverage for 25% of France’s metropolitan population by October 11, 2015, 60% by October 11, 2019, and 75% by October 11, 2023. As part of the allocation of the second block of LTE frequencies in January 2012 (800 MHz), SFR undertook to meet the following obligations: (i) SFR must provide the following very-high-speed mobile services: - 98% of France’s metropolitan population by January 2024 and 99.6% by January 2027; - coverage in the primary deployment area (approximately 18% of the metropolitan population and 63% geographically): SFR must cover 40% of the population in this primary deployment area by January 2017 and 90% by January 2022 (this obligation is to comply using 800 MHz frequencies); - coverage at a departmental level: SFR must cover 90% of the population of each department by January 2024 and 95% by January 2027; - coverage of high-priority roads (about 50,000 kilometers): SFR must cover 100% of these axes by January 2027 (this obligation is to comply using 800 MHz frequencies). (ii) SFR and Bouygues Telecom have a joint obligation to pool networks or share frequencies in the primary deployment area. (iii) SFR has an obligation to allow roaming for Free Mobile in the primary deployment area once Free Mobile covers 25% of France’s population with its own 2.6 GHz network and if it has not signed a national roaming agreement with another operator. (iv) SFR must, jointly with the other holders of 800 MHz band licenses, cover the city centers identified by the public authorities in the “white zones” program (more than 98% of the population) within no more than 15 years. ARCEP formally notified SFR, in a decision dated February 18, 2016, to meet its obligations to provide 4G coverage in the 800 MHz band for 40% of the population in a priority deployment zone (ZDP) as of January 17, 2017. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

The sharing agreement is similar to many mechanisms set up in other European countries. Each operator retains its own independent innovation capacity and total commercial and pricing independence. The first deliveries of cell plans were on April 30, 2014. On that occasion, each operator was informed of its partner’s deployment plans, as exchanges of technical information about the sites when developing the sharing agreement had been prohibited by ARCEP. This exchange of information led on October 24, 2014 to the agreement being adjusted, in particular regarding certain engineering choices that had been made at a time when the negotiating parties did not have full access to relevant data about each other’s networks. The target network completion date was pushed back by a year, from the end of 2017 to the end of 2018, to take into account previous deployment delays encountered. The first roll-outs of the RAN sharing coverage were in September 2015, and 8,933 sites were rolled out jointly by SFR and Bouygues the end of December 2017. SFR estimates that as of late December, this agreement corresponds to approximately €1,466 million in commitments given, and approximately €1,829 million in commitments received, for a net commitment of approximately €362 million, covering the entire long-term agreement. After performing tests on the field during the first quarter 2017, ARCEP noted at end-march 2017 that SFR fully complied with its obligations to cover 40% of the population in 4G. As part of the allocation of the third block of LTE frequencies in December 2015 (700 MHz,) SFR must comply with the following deployment obligation in very-high-speed mobile networks: - coverage of the primary deployment area: SFR must cover 50% of the population in this area by January 2022, 92% by January 2027 and 97.7% by December 2030 (this obligation is to comply using 700 MHz frequencies); - coverage of high-priority roads (about 50,000 kilometers): SFR must cover 100% of these axes by December 2030 (this obligation is to comply using 700 MHz frequencies); - coverage of regional railway network (at national level): at national level, SFR must comply with a 60% coverage rate of regional railway network by January 2022, 80% by January 2027 and 90% by December 2030; - coverage of regional railway network (at regional level); in each region, SFR must comply with a 60% coverage rate of regional railway network by January 2027 and 80% by December 2030.

They will deploy a new shared-access mobile network in an area covering 57% of the population. The agreement allows the two operators to improve their mobile coverage and to achieve significant savings over time. The agreement is based on two principles: - create a special purpose joint venture (Infracos) to manage the shared assets of the radio sites, i.e., the passive infrastructures and geographical sites where the telecom infrastructures and equipment are deployed. SFR and Bouygues Telecom each retain full ownership of their own telecom equipment assets and frequencies; - set up a RAN-sharing service that 2G, 3G and 4G operators can use in the shared territory.

Under the French General Tax Code, television services are subject to a reduced VAT rate of 5.5%, which was increased to 7% as of January 1, 2012 and to 10% from January 1, 2014, while Internet and telephony services are subject to the normal VAT rate of 19.6%, increased to 20% from January 1, 2014. When marketing multi-play offerings, the Group applies a price reduction on the price the Group would charge for these services on a stand-alone basis. This discount is primarily applied to the portion of its multi-play offers corresponding to its Internet and telephony services; the television service is the principal offer of the audited companies. As a result, the VAT charged to the Group’s multi-play subscribers is lower than if the discount applied to the television portion of its packages or if it were prorated on all services. -----",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

On August 18, 2011, SFR received a complaint claiming unfair pricing. On December 13, 2012, the Competition Authority fined SFR €66 million for abuse of dominant position, which SFR has paid.

The Court of Appeal postponed ruling on the merits of the case pending the Commission’s opinion. The Commission rendered its opinion on December 1, 2014, which went against SFR. The Court of Appeal issued its ruling on May 19, 2016; it granted a 20% fine rebate to SFR due to the new nature of the infraction. The French treasury (Trésor Public) returned €13.144 million to SFR. SFR appealed on a point of law on June 20, 2016. As a result of the French Competition Authority’s decision of December 13, 2012, Bouygues Telecom, Omea Telecom and EI Telecom (NRJ Mobile) brought suit against SFR in the Commercial Court for damages. In accordance with the transaction between SFR and Bouygues Telecom in June 2014, the closing hearing of the conciliation proceedings was held on December 5, 2014. The motion for discontinuance granted on September 11, 2014 ended the legal action between the two companies. With respect to the claim by Omea Telecom (€67.9 million) and EI Telecom (€28.6 million), SFR applied for stay on a ruling pending the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal, and obtained it. Omea withdrew on May 24, 2016. EI Telecom decided to recommence its legal proceedings and updated its loss to €28.4 million.

The complaint is pending. With respect to the proceedings on the merits, the Competition Authority on February 12, 2015 sent a notice of complaints to SFR and SRR, which decided not to dispute the complaints. A report of no contest was signed on April 1, 2015. A session in front of the Authority board was held on September 15, 2015. On November 30, 2015, the French Competition Authority fined SRR (and SFR as the parent company) €10.8 million. _Compensation disputes_ Following the Competition Authority’s decision of September 15, 2009 (provisional measures) and pending the Authority’s decision on the merits, on June 17, 2013, Outremer Telecom filed suit against SRR and SFR in the Commercial Court seeking remedy for the loss it believes it suffered as a result of SRR’s practices. Outremer Telecom claimed €23.5 million in damages subject to adjustment for unfair practices by SRR in the consumer market in mobile telephony on Réunion and Mayotte, and €1 million as damages in full for unfair practices by SRR in the business market in mobile telephony on Réunion and Mayotte. Outremer withdrew from the proceedings against SRR and SFR on May 10, 2015. On October 8, 2014, Orange Reunion sued SRR and SFR jointly and severally to pay €135.3 million for the loss suffered because of the practices sanctioned by the Competition Authority. Various procedural issues have been raised, on which a judgment is pending. The Court rendered its ruling on June 20, 2016 stating that the petitions of Orange Réunion cannot relate to the period preceding October 8, 2009 and therefore refused to exonerate SFR. On December 20, 2016, following the Court’s judgment, Orange updated its estimate of the loss it believes it suffered after October 8, 2009 and reached the amount of €88 million (which represents the non-time-barred portion of the alleged loss). On August 11, 2014, SFR also petitioned the District Court enforcement judge, who rendered his decision on May 18, 2015 by ordering SFR to pay €0.6 million (assessment of penalty for 118 abusive overflows). On July 24, 2017, Orange summoned SFR before the Paris Commercial Court in order to obtain the payment of €11.8 million by application of contractual penalty clauses concerning misbehaviors between July 2011 and July 2014. At the same date, Orange summoned Completel before the same Court, for the same reasons and basis, but for an amount of €9.7 million. By pleadings dated January 30, 2018, SFR and Completel asked for a ruling deferment in order to await the Court of Cassation judgment (second semester of 2018). The upcoming proceeding hearing is scheduled in March 2018 for the conclusions of Orange on the ruling deferment. SFR has made a counterclaim of €19 million for the outstanding balances of certain IRU. The Arbitration Court is being constituted. On September 9, 2016 by pleadings on counterclaims, Free requested the court to judge that SFR denigrated their capacities and services and claimed €475 million in damages. The Paris Commercial Court rendered its judgment on January 29, 2018. The Court sentenced Free Mobile to pay to SFR €20 million as moral damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. In addition, the court sentenced SFR to pay to Free Mobile €25 million as moral and material damage as a result of unfair competition made by disparagement. Accordingly, the court sentences, as compensation, SFR to pay to Free Mobile €5 million as damages. installations of Orange (mainly its ducts), are made available to the Group by Orange through these non-exclusive IRUs. Each of these IRUs covers a different geographic area and was signed for a term of 20 years. Following ARCEP’s Decision 2008-0835 of July 24, 2008, Orange published, on September 15, 2008, a technical and commercial offer made to telecommunication operators allowing them access to the civil engineering infrastructures of the local wire-based network, pursuant to which the operators can roll out their own fiber networks in Orange’s ducts. The terms of this mandatory technical and commercial offer are more restrictive than the terms that the Group enjoys under the Orange IRUs. As a result, in December 2011, NC Numericable and Orange signed amendments to the IRUs in order to comply with the November 4, 2010 ARCEP decision and to align the operating procedures set out in the IRUs with the procedures set out in the Orange general technical and commercial offer. Lastly, NC Numericable initiated parallel proceedings against Orange before the Commercial Court of Paris on October 7, 2010 claiming damages of €2.7 billion for breach and modification of the IRUs by Orange. On April 23, 2012, the Commercial Court of Paris ruled in favor of Orange and dismissed the Group’s claims for damages, ruling that there were no material differences between the original operational procedures and the new operational procedures imposed on NC Numericable by Orange under the terms of its general technical and commercial offer, published on September 15, 2008. NC Numericable appealed this decision before the Paris Court of Appeals and claimed the same amount of damages as it had before the Paris Commercial Court. Orange, in turn, claims that this proceeding materially impaired its brand and image, and is seeking an order to make NC Numericable pay damages of €50 million. In a ruling dated June 20, 2014, the Paris Court of Appeals dismissed NC Numericable’s appeal, which was referred to the Court of Cassation on August 14, 2014. On February 2, 2015, the Court of Cassation set aside the ruling of the Paris Court of Appeals except in that it recognized NC Numericable’s interest in acting and referred the case back to the Paris Court of Appeals. Sequalum claims that the termination was unlawful and continued to perform the contract, subject to any demands that the delegator may impose. Should the competent courts confirm this interpretation of unlawful termination, Sequalum may primarily have (i) to repay the public subsidies received for the DSP 92 project, normally the outstanding component of the subsidies (the company received €25 million in subsidies from the General Council), (ii) to reimburse any deferred income (estimated at €32 million by the Department) and (iii) to compensate the Department for any losses suffered (amount estimated by the Department of €212 million). In turn, the department of Hauts-de-Seine received the returnable assets of the DSP on July 1, 2015. Furthermore, the General Council will have to pay compensation to Sequalum, which essentially corresponds to the net value of the assets. On October 16, 2014, Sequalum filed a motion in the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise requesting the termination of the public service concession because of force majeure residing in the irreversible disruption of the structure of the contract, with the resulting payment of compensation in Sequalum’s favor. At December 31, 2015, the assets were removed from Sequalum’s accounts in the amount of €116 million. Income receivable in the amount of €139 million related to the expected indemnification was also recognized, an amount fully depreciated given the situation. On July 11, 2016, the department of Hauts-de-Seine established a breakdown of all amounts due (in its opinion) by each Party for the various disputes, and issued demands based on said breakdown. Each amount was subject to a decision by the public accountant dated July 13, 2016 (final amount established by the latter for a net amount of €181.6 million, taking into account the carrying amount due in his opinion to Sequalum). This breakdown, the various demands and the compensation decision were subject to applications for annulment filed by Sequalum with the Administrative Court of Cergy Pontoise on September 10, 12 and 14, 2016. These applications remain pending, except for the application for annulment relating to the breakdown (the court having considered that the breakdown was not a measure which could be appealed. Sequalum appealed this decision before the Versailles Administrative Court of Appeals). Altice France outlined that it had its own optical fibre in the Haut-de-Seine department enabling it to serve its customers. In September 2017, the department issued three revenue orders (titres de recette) in order to minimize the balance due to Sequalum at the time of counting. These demands were contested: - Order of an amount of €23.2 million for the unamortized portion of the subsidies: SFR’s appeal dismissed, - Order of an amount of €31.9 million for deferred income: successful appeal for SFR, - Order of an amount of €5.7 million for amounts received as prepayment for connections: SFR’s appeal dismissed. The Department issued a revenue order of €212 million for damages suffered as a result of the faults based on which the contract was terminated. The judgment was rendered on February 15, 2018. It reduces the indemnity by €187 million and reduces, correlatively, the amount of the revenue order to €26 million. The estimated cost of the subscription to “TF1 Premium” is more than € 16 million per year. SFR refusal of this offer will conduct TF1 Group to end the services broadcast authorization on July 28, 2017. Following the reaching of a settlement with TF1 group, SFR withdrew its request on November 7, 2017. On November 22, 2017, the CSA gave notice to SFR and TF1 of the abandonment of all of the requests submitted to it as part of settlement. Henceforth, the proceedings are closed.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691

On September 15, 2009, the French Competition Authority announced provisional measures against SRR, pending its decision on the merits. SRR had to discontinue any price spread exceeding its actual “off-net/on-net” costs in the network concerned. As the French Competition Authority found that SRR had not fully complied with its injunction, it fined SRR €2 million on January 24, 2012. In the proceedings on the merits, with regard to the “Consumers” component of the case, SRR requested and obtained a “no contest” on the complaints on July 31, 2013. On June 13, 2014, the Authority rendered its decision for the “Consumers” component of the case, fining SFR and its subsidiary SRR €45.9 million. _Non-residential mobile telephony market in Mayotte and Réunion_ The SRR premises were raided and records seized on September 12, 2013. The operation focused on the non-residential mobile telephony market in Réunion and Mayotte and was also in response to the complaint filed by Outremer Telecom. SRR appealed to the Senior Justice of the Saint-Denis Court of Appeals of Réunion against the decision authorizing the operation and a second appeal against its procedure. On June 13, 2014, the Senior Justice of the Saint-Denis Court of Appeals of Réunion handed down an order rescinding all the seizures at SRR in September 2013.

In announcing the opening of this in-depth investigation, the European Commission indicated that it believes that the sale of public assets to a private company without proper compensation gives the latter an economic advantage not enjoyed by its competitors, and that it therefore constitutes government aid within the meaning of the rules of the European Union and that the free-of-charge transfer of the cable networks and ducts by 33 French municipalities to NC Numericable, they have argued, confers a benefit of this type and, as such, is government aid. The European Commission has expressed doubts about the compatibility of the alleged aid with the rules of the European Union. The Group firmly denies the existence of any government aid. In addition, the decision to open an investigation concerns a relatively small number of network connections (approximately 200,000), the majority of which have not been migrated to EuroDocsis 3.0 and only allow access to a limited number of the Group’s television services.

The tax authorities thus intended to tax SFR separately from the Vivendi tax consolidation group, leading to a corporate tax of €711 million (principal) plus late interest and surcharges amounting to €663 million, for a total adjustment of €1,374 million. The proposed assessment has been cancelled in November 2017. At the same time, an accounting audit of years 2011 to 2013 led the tax authorities to make various adjustments in the principal amount of the corporate tax. The company, which is disputing the assessments proposed, maintained a provision of €43 million as of December 31, 2017. The company is subject to a tax inspection concerning the years 2014 and 2015. The company received in December 2017 a proposed tax reassessment about taxes on top remunerations. This proposal gave rise to the booking of a provision of €7.7 million, and the company is contesting the majority of the contemplated adjustments. Finally, the DVNI notified the Company of a tax audit regarding VAT 2016.",N/A,as_expected,2020,691
